3,"The scene where he's talking about that hot shot chef's dream of opening a pub and the camera never leaves the chef's face as his soul just dies and leaves his body will be a contender for most memorable moment in a 2021 movie. He Ratatouille'd the dad Amir keeps listening to that audionarration about why classical music is great and will last forever. When we get to his Dad's house, classical music is playing. Amir is trying to emulate his invincible father even though he himself probably doesn't like the music. In the end he finally shuts off the narration and allows himself to mourn his mother in a way his father never would.

Fantastic film. Underrated moment: Robin stealing the bike and then rage screaming at the owner before the owner has a chance to even say, ""Hey, that's my bike!"" and then riding off. I was incredibly impressed with this movie. The way this was executed was just perfect for me. At first you think it's going to be like John Wick or Taken, especially with the descent into the underworld at Edgar's place. But then you find out who Rob really is and it just completely changes everything.

Him using his cooking skills and history to talk to people and break them down was incredible to watch, and the parallels between the loss of Apple to Amir's mom was very well done. Fantastic meditation on loss and grief, cannot recommend this enough. Really enjoyed the movie overall. Could have easily just been standard revenge porn, cause revenge is a satisfying fantasy to watch. But I'm so happy it was so much more than that. Has a lot to say about loss and pursuing happiness.

That said, do have a question and feel like I missed something. What was up with the fighting pit? Some place where we people pay money to hit people and watch people get hit? How did that tie in to Robyn's backstory? I didn't really hear the few lines he talked about it. I'm confused cause he was obviously known for being an amazing chef. I just got lost in how taking hits for money tied into all of that, and it really only played in for the first 1/3 of the movie. “Fuck Seattle.”

10/10

I really like how, because we’ve been groomed to think this way, that a violent scene is about to happen and he just handles it with words. Very nice change of pace. I want to see it again soon to soak more of it in. There's an undeniably powerful sub-theme that highlights the different ways in which people handle grief:
1) Rob: he shares with Amir in the diner that he feels as though if he never looked for his pig, she would still be alive in his head. He wishes he could have taken the ""ignorance is bliss"" approach after already experiencing crippling grief from his wife's passing.
2) Amir: He tries to convince himself that his mom is dead, and mentions this to Rob. It's easier for him to think of her in past tense.
3) Amir's Dad: following his self-serving tendencies, he delays his wife's death (to her detriment) in an attempt to presumably delay the grief that would come with it.

One last thought: though I was initially crushed for Rob at the end, I think Amir provides him with enough purpose to make it through, even if that means seeing him once every Thursday. Rob gave Amir some crucial fatherly experiences (e.g. showing him how to cook the meal at his dad's home) and Amir gave Rob care and conversation that he hadn't experienced in years. He's not alone, it's just the start of his third chapter of love. All of us Nicolas Cage fans finally getting vindication as people start to realize/remember that he is a very good actor Me watching this move with no prior info: 

5 minutes in: okay cool it's about a guy and his pig in the 1800s

15 minutes in: okay cool it's like taken but with a pig and not actually in the 1800s

30 minutes in: okay it's like john wick but with a pig

1 hour in: okay it's like ratatouille with a pig

1.5 hours in: okay it's none of those things and actually about coping with the loss of a loved one Robin said he remembers every meal he’s ever cooked and every person he’s ever served.

Robin cooked the same meal that Amir’s father and mother had the night they came back very happy and drunk. Causes the father to emotionally breakdown. 

I’m not entirely sure the deeper meaning behind the persimmon tree scene. This juxtaposition of this sweet boy showing Cage this instrument and Cage looking like a deranged bloody homeless man is something else though. 

“I don’t think we have a persimmon tree.”

“No? That’s okay.”

“Did it die?”

…

There’s also the moment when he yells at the dude after he swipes the bike. 

Small tidbit - Laurie died in 2004, which would be 15 years from of 2019. He had left industry 15 years ago. 

Beautiful cinematography and definitely a story that will make you ponder the themes for a while. It certainly wasn’t the movie I was expecting based on the trailer but that’s not a bad thing. Without a doubt this is the best movie that I've seen since the theatres reopened.    
If you haven't seen this yet, go see it!  This director is amazing!    
And Nicholas Cage is absolutely fantastic.  This is his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas.  I really hope that either Cage or Alex Wolff get nominated for awards!  They deserve it. This isn’t the kind of movie that a lot of people expect it to be, but it’s pretty damn good nonetheless. 

And while this clearly isn’t a comedy, I did have a good chuckle at the “sentimental cooking scene” where Cage is *still* covered in blood lol That'll do, 'Pig'. Man he played the tape at the end and I realized it was going to be a song and eerily felt like it was going to be a Springsteen song. So weird. I'm a huge Bruce fan and ""I'm on fire"" always gets to me. Good cover Is there anyone else but Nic Cage who could pull off this breathtaking meditation on love and loss and also give a deadpan serious reading of the line, *”I don’t fuck my pig.”* I sobbed. Great movie. This was an astoundingly nice little film.  And we need more of this.  More MCU and Antman is fine, but these little weird movies have so much love to give.  

I did, however, constantly wish he washed his face.  But he DID wash his hands for the “big dinner” I saw it last night. It was a very good movie, but my favorite part was as I was walking out of the theater, I heard the couple in front of me talking. The woman said, ""Man, we shoulda gone to see Space Jam. This was some weird shit."" Saw this in the theater last night and really loved it. One of the best movies I've seen so far this year and I'm hoping to watch it again soon. Nicolas Cage is fantastic. I hope that dude decided to open his pub in the end. Follow your dreams, people. Ok so I just watched this with my partner. During the movie we thought it was a odd but a beautiful story. At the end, or the 'reveal' my partner burst into tears because she felt so sorry for him, she has only ever cried from one other movie, so this was a very rare reaction. When the credits rolled she quietly cried again. Did anyone else have this same reaction? I felt a slight sense of sorrow, but definitely far from tears myself. [deleted] I hope everyone that likes to meme on Nic Cage watches this movie. Dude is an incredible actor. He's probably not going to get an Oscar for this performance but he deserves one. Caught this in Philly earlier today. The fullest i've ever seen the indie theater since Shape of Water. Did the entire film look a bit washed out and too bright to anyone else?

Fantastic acting, fantastic screenwriting. I teared up a few times. As somebody else here said, it leaves a lot unsaid and expects the audience to pay attention to clues and things said in passing to have a full understanding of the situation. I also appreciated how it used comedy- even in grief, sometimes shit is just funny. The film also played with my expectations with dividing it into two parts. There was no three act structure. The second part never ends. There is no chapter for resolution. The first part is when he has his pig and the second part is the rest of his life when she is taken from him. Brooding.

I also felt that the film had some good commentary on gentrification and catering to a rich but tasteless audience. 

Funny things in the credits: pig is credited about halfway through but does not appear in cast in order of appearance. The dishes served in the film have credits right at the end. Special thanks to Janet Weiss (rocky horror? Lol) How is no one talking about the 200 year cycle earthquake/volcano foreshadowing? I was almost certain the movie was going to end with a startling rumble, as the music plays from the 'for Robin' tape. As i was watching, i grew frustrated by Robin not washing his wounds on his face that were clearly becoming infected and gross. it wasn’t until the very end that he learns about his pig and walks home that he washes his face in the creek, and i immediately understood. it felt like in solidarity, he wouldn’t take care of himself until he could take care of this animal that he loved. it made me very emotional along with the cassette tape of his wife right after. very beautiful movie. I found this movie absolutely fascinating. The performances felt real and raw, the screenplay was tight, and the score was progressive and moving. I’m happy Cage is getting praise and I look forward to seeing more from Sarnoski. This was one of my favorite movies of the last decade.

The themes about grief, loss, purpose, and meaning in life aren't novel, but the absurdity of the premise as well as many of the scenes themselves slips the themes into your consciousness in a way that *really* worked for me. I didn't realize I'm thinking about weighty topics until after their heft was embedded in my mind. I was not expecting to like this movie so much. It definitely was the surprise of the year so far. I thought it was going to be more horror based off the poster but was pleasantly surprised with a character driven drama. A great little movie that somehow turns its absurd premise on its head by transforming into a beautiful mediation on purpose and grief.

&#x200B;

I was worried by the 'secret society'/fight club aspect of it, and still feel that was needlessly stupid. But thankfully the film recovers from that odd misstep as soon as we meet the other chef.

&#x200B;

The surprising interactions between Rob (Cage), Chef Finway (David Knell) and Darius (Adam Arkin) were the highlights of the film. It was also touching to see a paternal relationship slowly develop between Rob and Amir (Wolff) - I particularly liked the scene where he asks the baker for another loaf just so he could give it to him. Could anybody try and explain the significance of the culinary Fight Club they had where Robin got punched in the face for a minute? Cause that part really confused me. Had me incredibly emotional. One of the most beautiful and profound films I've seen in some time, definitely my favorite of the year thus far. It was such a fascinating odyssey through a what felt like a new slice of the world. When he told that chef about his pub dream I shed a tear, and by the time he cooks that meal for Wolff's father I was in full on tears. Didn't know much about it and the first part got me thinking it was gonna be a more violent revenge film. But what we got was possibly the most subdued revenge movie and a unique character piece that was made for Nicolas Cage. 

Rob's breakdown when hearing about the fate of his pig was such a gut punch and reading about Nic Cage's channeling his nightmares about his cat passing away made it all even more heartbreaking.

What a confident debut by Michael Sarnoski, I can't wait for his next project. Cage gives the best performance of the year so far. Before watching this movie I jokingly said Nic Cage would win his second Oscar for it. After watching it he at the very least deserves a nomination for Best Actor. Shades of grief reminiscent of his Oscar winning performance in Leaving Las Vegas.

I never thought I’d ever root for someone portraying a grief stricken pig owning hermit truffle farmer master chef. Here’s to your next Best Actor nod Nic. See you at the Oscars. The movie sets you up to expect an action revenge movie like John Wick, and then goes in a very different direction.

I personally enjoyed the direction they went, but I totally understand if people weren't fans of it. I've seen a lot of action revenge movies, so this movie was a pleasant surprise.

Nic Cage was great, especially his scene with that chef who had worked under him. I said this in another thread, but 2 thoughts while watching this:

It’s like John Wick, but instead of weapons, Nic Cage uses beautifully curated meals and existential dread. 

It’s like Ratatouille, but Nic Cage is the rat. This film really took me by surprise, it was very fresh.

It has a huge amount of heart and is one of the better films I’ve seen this year.

Nicolas Cage really nailed it in his solemn understated performance. 


9/10. Great movie, absolutely hated the “get punched with your arms behind your back” scene. The whole meaning of this movie really caught me off guard, and it really drives home the point of that there are few things in life you actually care about and should focus on.

Standout scenes with surprisingly very little talking, just excellent editing and acting:

* Cage talking to the 5 star successful chef about the pub he never opened. Damn, I was rooting for that guy. I know this is a fictional movie but the range of emotions that actor went through in that scene it was like you were right there with him and I left the movie hoping he went and opened that pub.

* Cage cooking that meal for the father who stole the pig and literally zero speaking, just a powerful performance as you can see him go through the emotions that the food brought back into his life by bringing up old memories. This scene ONLY worked as powerful as it did because about 15 minutes earlier there was a previous scene with such a simple yet powerful line of dialogue, ""Have you always been this way, or only after she died?""

All I am saying is I thought this was going to be a slow burn comedy, but this was actually a top tier drama that was riding on top of a sort of ridiculous concept, but the ridiculous concept only existed because the overall message.

This movie was a solid 8 or 9/10 for me, if only because it completely caught me off guard. [deleted] Cage is such a good actor and I hate that so people try to make him a meme. Another outstanding performance in a very good movie. I might be alone in this, but I had to Google what truffles are during the movie. I'm from Mexico so maybe truffles aren't common here, in the beginning I thought Wolff was buying drugs from Cage, until I realize pigs are used to find this delicacy or whatever.

This character reminds a bit of Francis Mallmann, he is a famous Michelin star Argentine chef that lives in a very secluded place in the Patagonia, near Antartica. He is a sort of guru, so good that people travel to his cabin to learn from him. This film feels like it came out of nowhere. My girlfriend and I just left the theater dumbfounded. What an unexpectedly beautiful movie, and the ruminations on love/loss were done in a really touching way. 

Not only was the acting very strong, there are so many standout scenes in this movie that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. The underground fighting ring, the conversation with the chef at Feldman's, Rob visiting his old house, and that incredible dinner scene as the climax... The movie felt like it was going to be predictable, then completely ran the other way. Easily the best movie of the year for me. Hoping Nic Cage and even Alex Wolff get some solid recognition for their roles in the film. What a movie.

I love how the Persimmon Tree kinda parallels with the Pig. When Rob said at the diner that he should never came looking for his Pig, in his head, his pig will still alive. Same to the Persimmon tree, he thinks that it is still there because that's what he thinks until he went back to his old house and discover that it doesn't there anymore. 

The entire film reminds me of Barbra Streisand's song, The Way We Where. ""Memories, may be beautiful and yet what's too painful to remember."" If Cage doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this I will personally fist fight everyone at the Oscars Wow. Was not expecting that film or that good of a film. i’d love to hear takes from anyone active in the high-end urban restaurant scene. one of my serious exes was a sous chef at a prestigious spot in our city while we were dating and has subsequently left the business because it destroyed his mental health (and our relationship). both of my parents were in the industry through their 30’s. i worked FOH at a Beard-winning spot for a few months while i was in college. this movie punched me in the gut for a lot of reasons, but the looming impact of the industry really elevated it for me. the appeal for non-industry folks is obvious, but i’m curious to hear from others about their experience seeing this. Spoilers:

Wow. I fucking loved everything about this film.

I was amazed at the way the film built tension by establishing a violent tone early. It ratchets the tension of everything which comes after. Yet throughout the film Robin never throws a single punch at a human being, he just takes them. So many of them, from all sides. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a character who I felt so strongly for. Nic Cage’s best performance ever IMO. I love the choice to leave Lori’s tragedy felt rather than said. We all knew what the pig meant without needing to be told.

“I remember every meal I ever cooked. I remember every person I ever served.” What a fucking line.

I feel like this was the movie “You Were Never Really Here” wanted to be lol. NEON is quickly becoming one of my favorite indie film outlets. really good movie I fell into the trap of expecting something specific going into this.

What I got was so much better than that ever could have been. One of the better films that I have seen during this summer (if we are talking about newer releases). Pig asks the audience about forgiveness and lost and how we can deal with them, and Michael Sarnoski executed these themes in a meaningful way. Great debut for Sarnoski and a great return for Nicholas Cage. Wow. Hit from the left field hard by this. What a beautiful little quiet film. I thought of Nic Cage as a bit of a joke actor the last few years but he’s legitimately great in this, reminding you that he’s a fantastic actor when he wants to be. 
I got the impression that on paper this was going to be a bit wackier than it turned out, Cage playing it straighter than intended by the casting. And it turned out so much better for it. It’s at its heart a snapshot of grief at its greatest without being bogged down by the misery itself. Great, great film. I’m saddened by the way this film was portrayed in the trailer, like it wasn’t exactly misleading, but I’m afraid a lot of people are going to go into this expecting John Wick with Nicolas Cage. 

This was easily the best film I’ve seen in 2021, I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect from it, but man was every single thing about this movie on point. As an aspiring filmmaker, I’m truly jealous Michael Sarnoski came out of the gate with the knockout, I hope to one day debut with a film even half as good as this. Watched it last night with a group of friends. Was the first time back at a theatre in a year. Smoked a joint in the parking lot, and went in with moderate expectations. Didn’t expect to finish the film sobbing, my make up running down my face. Lost my dad in June 2020 to cancer, his middle name was Roblyn. I kept seeing similarities in him and Robin. I wasn’t expecting this film to explore grief, and in such a powerful way. Crying as I write this even now. Ending song was gorgeous too.
Gonna see it again on Tuesday! Adam Arkin comes in with a temperature changing performance. Great movie.

As a Portlander, I appreciate that this was clearly filmed in Portland and wasn't shot in Vancouver BC. It shows. 

A lot of people thought the trailer was going to be John Wick but with a big but I have to say that those emotional confrontations are just as if not more impactful than any gun shot. Ugggggggh totally crushed me. I was very careful not to learn too much about the film other than the deep brooding marketing that kept popping up in my web browsing. I never even watched the trailer. I'm so happy because I really got the untainted experience.

What a rare film that takes all expectations and flips them on their heads though. It very deliberately tugs you along with great steady tension and looming dread (mimicking Cage's very purposeful shuffle) only to have this marvelous awakening as it all comes into focus. Beautiful, dreadful, grief stricken, and just wonderful. A near perfect anti-John Wick film.

I love that Cage keeps finding these offbeat projects. They're perfect for him and so refreshing. That ending was something else, no words spoken yet you feel the emotion. Camera glances at the empty bed for the pig, then when the song starts playing it really hits you. Just so everyone knows: even with the largest earthquake and tsunami, it will never reach Portland lol. Too far inland with mountains that are thousands of feet tall. The tidal wave wouldn't get past Tillamook forest. We are due for a big earthquake soon though, he was right about that. But also the bridges in Portland should take it fine, and they've even already made adjustments to some of the bridges to accommodate for the earthquake. 

And finally, yes, Mt. Hood is an active volcano and we will probably see it erupt in our lifetime. But don't worry, those pyroclastic flows and lahars aren't going to reach Portland. The worst Portland would experience is smoke and ash from the fires. 

I'm also really fun at parties. Great movie though! Nic Cage killed it. 7/10 Thought it was fantastic. Nicolas Cage continues to be one of the most fascinating actors of his generation (it's a shame he's been reduced to 'Le Wacky One True Hecking God XD!!!' amongst a small portion of film fans), and will surely be in contention for all sorts of awards. Alex Wolff was fantastic as well, and I can't believe this was a debut feature for Sarnoski. He's going to go on to do big things. 

Genuinely interested as to what the general audience reaction to this will be. Think lots of people will go in expecting John Wick w/ a pig and Nicolas Cage, and will be faced with a tremendous meditation on love and grief. So Robin Feld was at one point the greatest chef in Portland, and after his wife died he withdrew from society and went to the woods with his pig? Best film i have seen since The Lighthouse A big few weeks at the cinemas for pigs between this, Black Widow, Fear Street III, and Notorious P.I.G. in Space Jam 2. In Amir's mind, his mother is dead. But she's actually alive.

In Rob's mind, the pig is alive. But she's actually dead.

A great contrast. I just saw it and I wish people would stop mentioning John Wick when describing the movie as there’s close to zero action. I feel like there’s gonna be a lot of disappointed people who will go see this movie expecting a lot of crazy revenge action [Hidden John Malkovich cameo surprised nobody noticed](https://i.imgur.com/pToHZFJ.png) Man when I put together that he was cooking the same meal for the dad I was absolutely floored This blew me away, I thought it was so well done. The ending was subtle and perfect and [that cover of “I’m on Fire” ](https://youtu.be/DnSgam75Bmo)absolutely broke me. Went into this blind because of the interesting premise and because of Nicholas Cage. This was definitely one of my best cinematic surprises to date. Really enjoyed this film both in craftsmanship and in what it conveyed. 9/10 Fantastic film. Definitely going to give it another watch. People really don't realize how great of an actor Cage is. He is on another level. this is nick cage at his best game. loved it I legitimately thought (and hoped) they were going to find out that Amir's dad was lying about >!the pig dying!<, and that Amir would stick it to his dad and help Robin find it. I kinda wish I didn't know what I was getting into and expected it to be another take on the John Wick formula like so many other people did going so that I would've been surprised going in that it's the complete opposite of that, but I thought this was terrific. I thought the directing itself doesn't set itself apart from your average indie film today but Cage's performance is just devastating and brought me to tears. My absolute favorite performance of the year so far. Nothing in life matters except the fleeting moments and experiences we have with those close to us. 

Once they are gone, nothing real is left. Robs talk about how they'll all be underwater anyways. 

That last scene showed him at peace.

Best film I've seen this year. Wolff and Cage brought their A game and then some. Going in entirely blind was the right move. What a moving experience. Those last ten minutes alone won me over; one of my favorite endings that I’ve seen all year. Really excited to see more of the oacu (Oregon Agriculture Cinematic Universe) after seeing this and First Cow. Was ready hoping for a Nick Fury type to link the two movies. Can't wait to watch this. The man can act. Definitely not what I expected, but I enjoyed this. Enough suspense to keep you guessing if it’s going to turn into Cage fighting everyone, then it goes the opposite direction. 

Probably the best movie I’ve seen recently. Loved the movie, seems pretty clear to me he killed himself though. Ties to Amir's point when talking about his mom. ""People like that will do it eventually."" Late to the party, but I just wanted to throw an opinion. I saw this without having seen a trailer; all I knew is that Nicolas Cage wants his pig back and the reviews were overwhelmingly positive. I had to let it sit for awhile because while I really enjoyed it, I wasn’t sure how much I liked it.

I think this movie fuckin’ rocks! It’s such a unique take on the revenge movie, but instead of violence, it resorts to cooking to resolve the issues. When you think it’s going in one direction, it goes the opposite way. When you think Nic Cage is gonna rip someone’s throat out and shit down their neck, he pierces their soul through monologue. I haven’t been keeping up with any recent releases, but I’m glad I went out and saw this one because it was a genuine surprise. Did anyone else feel that Cage scream before it actually happened (bicycle scene)? I braced for it, and it was easily my favourite part of the movie. 

Best movie experience of the year for me. Had to get up to pee in the last few minutes, someone help fill in for me what happened during the scene at the diner with Robin and Amir very near the end please! They sat down and asked for pie, had to order brownies instead... and then I returned and Robin said he was going to walk and Amir went in his car and cried. What was that scene like? Overall, loved the movie. Dann this movie is so sad. I thought for sure he was gonna get his pig back at the end. 

Not the movie I was expecting to see but in retrospect - a very good movie. I went into this completely blind. I heard Pig, staring Nicolas Cage and I bought tickets. I was honestly blown away. It was a strange mix of John Wick, Fight Club, and then the most bizarre twist of self-reflection and what it truly means to want something in life. Definitely a different movie, but one worth seeing. I loved the movie as a whole, but I absolutely hated the ending. 

Here's how I would have ended it. 

The meal he preps for that guy's dad brings him to tears as it conjures up memories. He gives him the pig back and his son finds his niche for becoming a soux chef. 

There ya go, happy ending. We just finished it a few hours ago. Husband was disappointed a bit because he said the trailer hyped it. I felt it showed what it needed and I felt they were able to tell a part of Robin's story. I was trying to explain to him that some movies tend to leave details from the conversation in passing and that open-ended stories work in certain movies. His main gripe was that he felt it's still just 3/4 of a story and wanted to know what happened after that. I honestly enjoyed it, and explained to him part of their theme was getting over their loss. I loved how you learned about Rob’s past with his interactions with others.  Like the head chef’s reaction upon recognizing him shows that Rob was a god tier chef back in the day.  Rob’s monologue that broke the chef completely down provided some exposition about why he left it all behind.  

I also really dug the scene with the baker, Jezebel.   The long camera shot kind of reflected the dynamic between a chef and baker… distanced, but respectful of each other’s skill.  I also laughed when he grabbed two armfuls of her goods on the way out, knowing he probably wasn’t going to see her again.  It loosely reminded me of a part in Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential where he describes how much slack he cut his enigmatic baker because of how good his bread was. Finally, a movie about the infamous, dangerous and elusive underground Oregon. . . truffle farming? 

Starts out very John Wick and thought it was going to go a different angle, but ends up being a love letter to food and a deconstruction of grief. I like how it kind of subverts expectations in where you think the movie is going. Cage looks badass as fuck and you think he's going to go full Mandy and just start beating the shit out of people looking for his damn pig (cute pig by the way), but the movie goes a completely different angle. 

Speaking of Cage he is great, while subdued, it's a v good performance and I hope he gets at least a little recognition. Though I would say all the character's he's played in the last few years have sort of a similar vibe to them, and aesthetic. This is though, definitely his most 'tender' role I've seen him play in a long time. I don't think the kid from Hereditary was as good, just thought he was serviceable. 

I think it's cool that the movie doesn't really properly set up it's back story and we're left to kind of fill in the pieces a bit—not everything is laid out for you. The movie sets a pace and stays it throughout and I respect that for sure, but i think I just expected to be blown away and I was more just left with the thought 'hm that was nice'. 

I really liked the Chef scene in the restaurant, definitely a highlight of the movie for me. It also had some good funny moments that were unexpected. Cage had some great one liners. 

I love Portland and want to go back. I kept thinking watching it 'I've been there!'

Cage the Piglet. This movie tried so hard and just was not good. I don't understand why this sub is losing its mind over it. Just not well done. I have no problem with what the movie was trying to be but it was trying so hard. Movie definitely peaks in the middle and gets worse and worse. If it had better dialogue I might have been more patient with it but man, just really rough writing. There are some great chemistry moments between the two mains but wow was this not good. I’m not as excited as most people here, but it was a good movie. Definitely worth a watch. I felt like it was a pretty good movie wrapped inside a kind of bad movie. It was as if someone wrote a really great movie and then let a college grad read it once and then rewrite it the best they could from memory. 

Overall I enjoyed it, but the character and world building was pretty lacking and the tone couldn't really settle itself one way or another. The movie tries to sell you that the villain of the movie is a dangerous mobster who has half the city in his pocket...and then they walk into his house and cook him dinner in his kitchen.

The underground chef fight club, and all the other stops on his hunt just didn't feel satisfying. The movie was Nick Cage calmly asking people where his pig was for 90 minutes. That would've been fine if the side characters didn't feel like cardboard cutouts. 

Overall I'd give it a 7/10. It was enjoyable, but a bit sloppy. I am surprised that so many people liked this movie. I thought it was very random, fake deep, bad acting, story and  dialogues. There was no chemistry between Robin and Amir. I enjoyed watching the movie, because it was bad in a very wired, surprising way that made it a bit funny. I don't want to be a dick, but there are so many good review so I want to find someone that agrees haha. 

I must say I liked the cinematography of the movie and the music. Pig reminds us why Nicolas Cage is an Oscar winner. This is a fantastic movie, highly recommend! 
Does anyone know the name of the cover of ""I'm on fire"" by Bruce Springsteen? The song plays at the every end of the movie. I can't find the cover anywhere. This may get buried, but if you like the style and touching elements of this movie, you may like ""First Cow"". The scene where cage  is talking to the chef at fenways just hit so hard. Best acting we will see this year i bet how does nicholas cage go from starring in willy’s wonderland to this gem I went in expecting a John Wick movie but I'm so glad they went kind of the opposite path of those movies. The more the movie went on, the more I kept thinking ""is he about to get violent with someone? because that would feel really out of place at this point"" and glad they stuck with that. My favorite movie of the year so far—anyone feel like the movie stylistically is similar to a Miyazaki anime? A lot of lingering, contemplative shots and also lots of scenes of just nature. I thought he was just becoming more and more of a mess as the movie progressed but at the end once he found out what happened to his pig, He was completing the stage of Acceptance and was able to move on. Possibly hours after taking it all in. He was able to clean himself up, and being to move on. He was also able to bring himself to listing to the recording of his wife again. Okay. This might be my favorite film of the year so far. Unbelievably good. 

Was expecting John Wick, but got Ratatouille. Not disappointed in the slightest. Apparently the first cut was over 2 hours but they made them cut it because it felt too long. I'd love to see a directors cut. I love how’s there’s 5 different scenes of them just using Robin Felds name just for getting in to places. I like that there’s a few ways to read Darius’s (the dad) money offer to Robin. It could be that he knows Robin is a name that could cause him significant trouble around town and he’s trying to pay that off in keeping with his bully mafioso persona. 

But it could also be that, knowing the pig is already dead, that he’s trying to give Robin some money for his trouble. A chef he (at least to some degree) still respects because of Robin’s impact on he and his wife’s life. I honestly thought to myself “wtf? Was that just the best movie I’ve ever seen in my life?”  With respect to Babe, this is surely the First Cow of movies about pigs (for what it’s worth, the Babe of movies about cows is Barnyard), and a worthwhile entry in the Alex Wolff Family Issues Cinematic Universe (alongside Hereditary and The Naked Brothers Band). It’s so much less of a Weird Arthouse Nicholas Cage Movie than you’d expect, and so much more than its literal premise suggests. Gripping, begrudgingly funny at times, and surprisingly moving - yeah, that’ll do, Pig. That’ll do.  That guy's performance was the best in the entire movie, and this was a well acted movie. 

It's also the scene that best explains the backstory of Nicolas Cage's character so it's good that the best scene wasn't just a throwaway. The way Finway *instantly* described his signature dish for his dream pub, when Robin asked, spoke volumes. Honestly I want that monologue framed so I can see it every morning. Best scene of the movie and even delivers the movie’s tagline in it. One of my favorite scenes of the year. I’d love to explore that scene in a stage production sometime. I love how his description of his restaurant was ""local stuff that is deconstructed"" and he ended up being a local who's life was completely deconstructed in that one conversation. That whole scene gave me No Country For Old Men Gas Station vibes You are so correct. By far the absolute best movie scene in 2021.

>!When I watched the scene you can almost pin point the exact moment when his soul dies, a fast brow furrow and tear shrink wrapped eyes ready to explode. !<

>!There was some dancing around, of course, by Chef Finlay trying to avoid the subject of pursuing his dream.!<  
>!One moment in particular was cruelly hilarious because we all do it when exposed to our own lies we tell ourselves everyday was when Chef Feld says, ""Derek... what was it that you always talked about opening. Wasn't it a pub?"" Chef Finlay fumbles for his words and limply repeats, ""Everyone loves it here.This... this is a... a... huge success."" haha. So funny because of his wishy washy response with his ego fighting to survive under the onslaught of Chef Feld's inquisition. !<

One point that is appropriate to mention here is that silence in the presence of eating guests is the greatest compliment a chef can ever receive. This means that people are far to busy eating, thoroughly enjoying and fully enraptured with your cooked food to even talk to the other seated guests.

>!Everyone around the central table with Chef Finlay, Chef Feld and Amir are all talking away with no one really engrossed in eating the dish made by Chef Finlay. Also no one leans into table of Chef Feld, Amir to offer praise to Chef Finlay nor does anyone stop Chef Finlay when he walks up to Chef Feld, Amir's table. No one knows or cares about Chef Finlay.!<

>!Then Chef Feld devastatingly inquires, ""Why didn't you open your pub?"" which leaves Chef Finlay totally stripped bare. Chef Finlay cannot form sentences and has even lost his voice with a babbling, ""I... I...  dunno if I even wanted a pub."" That exact moment you can see and hear his heart rip asunder and the pain of abandoning his dream gushes out.!<

>! Chef Feld then continues his interrogation. ""You said you had a few rooms upstairs... a real English pub."" More feeble arguments by Chef Finlay's ego claiming ""no one wants pubs... it's a bad investment"" just shows the extent we all go to trying to cover up the lies we tell ourselves.!<

>! Chef Feld: ""What was going to be your signature dish?"" Chef Finlay: ""Liver scotch eggs on a Honey Cream Mustard."" In my opinion I felt the actor failed a bit to deliver a truly authentic response. It was acted well but still to me it seemed a bit canned and to quickly delivered by the actor. I felt at that moment he was just reading a script line but then the actor quickly recovered with his ""insanity laugh"". Still well done though.!<

>!Chef Feld then fires the coup de grace. Chef Feld goes on to to say words heavy with pursuing passion, presenting a genuine article of your craft wielded by the gifts God has bestowed upon you, and in life you only have a handful of True Loves that are forever yours. Nicolas Cage really does a breathtaking outstanding job here. His eyebrow flicker at ""...because you haven't .... Shown Them."" really hammers the truth of a Chef making a ""piece de resistance"" that astounds guests versus just frying up a platter of ""shit on a shingle""!<

>!With those words of exposing Chef Finlay as a fraud who has abandoned his lifes dream of opening a pub the camera focuses onto Chef Finlay. The eyebrow tweaks, the forced grin, the desperate laugh, the years sunken eyes devoid of passion, the dry throat panting, the grasping ears holding every word of Chef Feld all culminates to Chef Finlay greedily guzzling a goblet of wine. The first drink his soul has had in years. !< Easily the best scene in the movie. It was fantastic. As a chef……. I fucking FELT that scene Came to post this exact comment lol! Lmao That moment was a little cliche feeling to me thanks to ratatouille lol. it also ties into Rob’s monologue to Finway about forcing yourself to pursue something you don’t care about just for appearances. loved this. I felt like it also reinforces that not everything needs to be explained to innately understand something. We learn a little bit about Robin’s backstory, but we don’t need to know every little detail to understand him. I thought that was so fantastically well done. I also caught that the narrator was using the same sort of definition on what makes music great that morons like Ben Shapiro use to discredit rap, the whole “it’s not real music!” shtick. To me that felt like such a great parallel with the chef who had that super fancy restaurant. He’s doing this style of cooking because the food critics like it I couldn't figure out what his dad actually does... Restaurant supplier turned mob boss? That ""you don't know what I am"" line was pretty chilling Fuck, now I'm gonna cry I also liked how that scene is closely followed by Rob listening to the song Laurie recorded for him.  He listens to it confronting his grief and embracing what he really cares about.  It is not music made to be universally appreciated for ages like the classical tape.  Laurie's tape is just for him, and it is temporary--much like anything in our life that truly has meaning. To further your point, he was rocking an almost identical watch as his dad This is why I love reddit: comments like this. Cheers! i live in portland, and that was the most legitimate portland thing in the movie That part made me giggle. It was great and I assumed it wasn't even the owners just some random guy on a bike which made it that much funnier. I'd pay good money to have Nic Cage yell at me. GOOD money. I thought it was the kid he was talking to earlier on the porch and was dying laughing a true cage moment Not looking for major spoilers, but can you tell me if the pig makes it through the movie okay? I’m not proud of this….but I probably won’t see it if it doesn’t I feel like I'm taking crazy pills, but I'm already rooting for Nic Cage win at the Academy next year for Pig. My, oh my what an absolute stellar performance by him. 

Probably career-best in my opinion. Way up there, even better in my opinion, with Raising Arizona and Leaving Las Vegas. 

This is how Nic Cage without any debts looks like. Man is a powerhouse in front of the cameras. And you can see how the role perfectly suits him. An A-list Chef (Cage in previous times) comes back from the ruins of anonymity (his decline into B movies) to show the world he's still here. 

Perfect casting. Perfect performance. I might be off base but I think it represents how cutthroat and brutal the restaurant business is, and it's a more visually striking way to represent that over sabotage or a conversation. It also adds an idea of mystery around this towns restaurant/chef scene, where underground clubs and backroom deals are common place. Edgar told Robyn, that there was a time when his name meant something to people, and now he has no value, and therefore refused to give the information that Robyn needed. And when people started to shell out money when Robyn entered into the beat-up(?), Robyn proved him wrong and Edgar gave him the name of the place. I think it sets up the surreal exaggerated world of the city. I also think that was part of the plan to keep the audience wondering if it would turn into a violent revenge film. I was engaged all the way to the end wondering if Cage was going to decapitate Adam Arkin and open a ""long pig"" food cart. lol I think chefs and restaurant workers paid to beat homeless people because the first guy being beat up looked homeless and he got the money for getting beat up. Probably a way for them to relieve stress and homeless people get money. I'm assuming Robin was a pretty meticulous and demanding chef. These guys possibly worked for Chef Robin in the past and when they saw his name laid down some good money to beat the shit out of him because that was their daily fantasy working for him. 

Could be wrong though. I took it as restaurant workers pay money to beat up some of the chefs in the industry. Robyn does say “the bigger your name the higher the bid” so I’d imagine that some of these workers would want to get some licks in on some a-hole chef. > What was up with the fighting pit? Some place where we people pay money to hit people and watch people get hit? How did that tie in to Robyn's backstory? I didn't really hear the few lines he talked about it. I'm confused cause he was obviously known for being an amazing chef. I just got lost in how taking hits for money tied into all of that, and it really only played in for the first 1/3 of the movie.

These are fight clubs where the food industry workers can pay some vagrant to let them beat them up to lay off some steam. The food industry is notoriously stressful, so the idea of having an underground hobo fight pit tht specifically caters to them doesn't sound so crazy. Hobos getting paid to be beaten up isn't new to film neither: there are scenes in *Mr. Robot* where Tyrell Wellick pays a hobo to let him beat him up after he has a rough day at the office.

Robin would have known about them because he was part of the industry. And, as Lauren's tape reveals, it sounds as though as back in the day he would go to restaurants and harshly criticize and complain about the food and service. Naturally, people who worked in those places would have an axe to grind with him due to his past treatment of them, so they'd pay a premium to beat *him* up instead of just another vagrant.

Enough money to make Edgar reconsider not helping him, since I'm sure he takes a cut of that. My first impression is that this movie seems engineered be the opposite of a John Wick film. The underground ""society"" is just beating up homeless people. Those fights are real and have been around for some time. Exploitation and abuse of the homeless under the guise of ""entertainment"" to some sick folks. Remember, Rob is considered homeless by EVERYONE who sees him. And he had to find the character, the one running the fights, who just before that had told him he held no value; was invisible. Many people think this of the homeless. The restaurant business is fucking terribly stressful. These restaurant workers are blowing off steam by beating the hell out of people.

honestly, i liked that scene the least. it was the most disjointed piece of the entire movie. Also all of his hookups around the city seemed to be his old students who were successful. Famous. Could some of the old fighters be his or some other famous chefs sharing sacred recipes? Stolen from famous restaurants/chefs? Secrets? Just a thought. I saw this movie in Portland, OR and everyone laughed when he said fuck Seattle lmao I didn't know/remember what this referenced, so I tried [googling it](https://imgur.com/a/lBTdGCX)

The internet truly is a marvellous place. I loved the bit where Rob gave Amir permission to use his name to get the stuff and it meant so much to Amir because I'd bet you $1000 that Amir's dad doesn't even let Amir tell anyone that he's his dad. He's not allowed to trade on the name. But demigod Robin Feld allows him to use his name and that means so much to him. I still think Amir should have pointed out he'd never have been able to live with himself if he didn't look for the pig Its the same thing that happened after Robin lost his wife.  He left everything he knew and went to the woods.  Its like she was still there, alive, in the city, because the city never changed for him and he never had to experience any reminder of her loss.  He was finally able to grieve now for both of them for the first time. To me it seems pretty clear Rob killed himself and Amir knew, that's why he slept in the car so he could go find him the next day like he was saying earlier in the film.  Plus when Amir described his mom and how ""People like that just go eventually."" And really all the parallels to his mom with things like ""Don't you wish he would let you die?"" Rob is done, and ready to leave, and that's OK He never stopped though. Between Pig, Mandy, Color Out of Space, Joe, and Mom and Dad he’s always popping up in some niche movie that shows off his unique talents. He just does a ton of bullshit too so he gets a bad reputation. They should’ve realized it way back when Joe came out. That’s when I fell in love with him for the second time and he’s made me proud so many more times since then honestly even in his worst b movie I always feel like hes the best part like the guy is entertaining in many different roles and thats the stamp of a great actor I laughed too hard reading this lol I just watched this with my husband earlier this evening and these were my exact thoughts throughout the movie. Are you me? To me the scene of him at his old house talking to the kid about the persimmon tree was strengthening the theme of Robyn returning to the past he left behind when he lost his wife and seeing life had carried on. A new family with a child lives in his old house now and the persimmon tree is gone, but it’s not better or worse than he left it, just different. Sorry for the late question - just watched the movie tonight. Do you think the wife dying in 2004 implies that she was killed in the 2004 boxing day tsunami and that's the reason he gave that speech about the earthquake and tidal wave? Agreed. He was incredible in Leaving Las Vegas. I also loved him in Matchstick Men. Mandy though. He’s kind of a similar character in Mandy lol I think it was supposed to be funny but also serious. I felt the entire time the movie was trying to balance that actually. Cause the premise is absolutely wild. “He’s Buddhist” absolutely killed in my theater. The movie was unusually refreshing. I loved the cinematography and the main colors of the movie. It was like earthy tones. The shots felt, like you were there with them. The music was on point. I saw it because I was expecting another b action movie from Cage, instead I got a 2 hour long therapy movie on grief. It's a great watch for the journey at least.



This is the The Grey all over again. Trailer shows an action star and I end up in a drama using my brain to think. Cage had multiple opportunities to shower and clean himself up and he just straight up refused to I couldn’t help but think about that the whole time, the dude never cleaned up, straight up couldn’t have cared less. In fact the dude cared so little OTHERS didn’t seem to care... 

I liked it a lot. I couldn’t stop thinking how bad he must have smelled by that point That'll do I'm still trying to figure out if the cover is floating around somewhere on the internet or if someone did it just for the recording in that scene. I sobbed when I realized what song it was. Her voice too! Man. Incredible. Nicolas Cage must be something else in real life. He just got married to some Japanese girl after dating long distance through the pandemic for like…less than a year. She seems kind of dark/artsy. Nobody but the one true god could deliver that line and it not fall flat. I was tearing up as he was getting in to bed with the song playing. And as I left the theater I full on cried.  This movie just embeds itself under your skin in a beautifully dark kind of way. I cried during the cooking scene until the credits. What an amazing movie. He washed his face in the river at the end. I think it was symbolic of his grief, or the emotional toll of returning to his past life. Reminds me of when I saw Snowpiercer and I saw a couple walk out afterwards with the wife loudly going:

""Can you explain to me what the fuck just happened?"" Yeah, It's a very different movie than I was expecting. I was riveted the whole was through but a lot of general audiences are going to be disappointed. The movie was marketed as a John Wick knock off but it was surprisingly unique and thoughtful. Some people might think it was a bait and switch. the average movie goer has some real bad taste lol Both films are about daddy issues if you think about it. I think Space Jam is inherently a lot more weirder than this film. Space jam was incredibly bad That scene was the standout of the movie imo, it had ME rethinking my entire life, Jesus. Nic Cage and the other guy killed it. Liver (?) scotch egg with a honey curry sauce?  

Damn.  It was a great scene. That was such a great scene. Deviled eggs beat that fancy ass shit Man, I really don’t think he’s going to. He’s already too successful and sunken into his fabricated life. Doesn’t strike me as the type to be brave enough to burn it all down. I teared up. Two movies I’ve watched recently made me cry, The Father and Pig. Usually I don’t cry in most movies. I teared up the scene where he was getting bread. I felt really emotional from the cooking scene until the end. I was crying and holding back my sobs in the theatre but when they 'revealed' it, I couldn’t hold back any longer. This movie broke my heart. My husband and I both teared up. Normal for me, not as much for him (except some Pixar movies lol) Can I ask what other film made your partner cry? when he got home and looked at the empty pig’s bed and his dead wife’s tape played, i nearly sobbed. the long walk home, the silent processing. idk. it didn’t ‘fuck’ with me per-say but i was really touched and heartbroken by the end. Great to see Alex Wolff in a more serious role, seems like his career is really taking off. Wolff and Cage cemented acting nominations in my book. Wolff tries hard to be a douchebag Suave business guy but is constantly under his dads shadow. He really drove this film home. Without him, it would’ve been a Cage show, and while I wouldn’t have minded that, the movie wouldn’t have had the same emotional impact that it did This film cemented for me that he’s a great actor with range. Prior, I had only seen him in dark, brooding roles. There’s still some overlap here, but there was enough contrast that prompted me to doubt if I was watching a different actor. He is by far one of my newest favorite actors! Anytime I see him in shit I get excited now. He was the perfect companion to Cage in this, I really loved how gentle and kind he was even though he put on that facade to begin with. Such a cool kid. Can’t understate how important his character and performance was to conveying the ‘legend’ and awe that Cage’s character is supposed to inspire throughout. Everytime another character realised who Cage was, they cut to Alex Wolff and he was practically on the verge of tears the whole time. It really added a lot of emotion and weight. He's great.  Was excellent in My Friend Dahmer as well. People forget Cage won an Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. He may be eccentric but he’s still talented. Ethan Hawke said Cage is “the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art of acting.” Even in the shittiest movies he does, he's often the best part because he seems more aware of what kind of movie he's in

Sure there are exceptions (Looking at you Ghost Rider) but he's often good if not great Nic Cage is an incredible actor. The Weather Man is easily my top 1 or 2 movie of all time. He’s really fantastic in it Its actually in three parts if I'm not mistaken. 

1.) Truffle Tart
2.) French Toast and something else (?)
3.) Bird, Bread and something else (lol) On the washed out and too bright thing:  completely opposite on my end.  it was dark and muddy and hard to see, even in brighter exterior scenes.  Maybe it was just bad projection.  There was also the glare of an Exit sign creating a giant red splotch on the bottom right quadrant of the screen.  I'd like to see the movie again at a better theater. i saw it at the Ritz 5 too and in the first five mins my friend turned to me and said “this looks like shit”. i hope they fix their projection so i can see it again. They probably meant the Janet Weiss that used to be the drummer for Sleater-Kinney That was more about how everyone's time is limited. Like when Robin is talking with that guy at the gastropub, life is all about doing what you love, not just doing what you think others want. That scene is played for laughs and makes him sound a little paranoid and is another character touch about his detachment from larger society, but I think if you’re in the PNW, the scariest words in your vocabulary are “full margin rupture.”

> Without moving your hands, curl your right knuckles up, so that they point toward the ceiling. Under pressure from Juan de Fuca, the stuck edge of North America is bulging upward and compressing eastward, at the rate of, respectively, three to four millimetres and thirty to forty millimetres a year. It can do so for quite some time, because, as continent stuff goes, it is young, made of rock that is still relatively elastic. (Rocks, like us, get stiffer as they age.) But it cannot do so indefinitely. There is a backstop—the craton, that ancient unbudgeable mass at the center of the continent—and, sooner or later, North America will rebound like a spring. If, on that occasion, only the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone gives way—your first two fingers, say—the magnitude of the resulting quake will be somewhere between 8.0 and 8.6. That’s the big one. If the entire zone gives way at once, an event that seismologists call a full-margin rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7 and 9.2. That’s the very big one.

[One of my favorite New Yorker articles.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one) This is really late but I was just as bothered by him not taking care of the wounds at first until I realized they represented grief. Those pains don't go away and you can't just clean them up and he only deals with them at the end once he accepts his pig is gone. I have to wonder if that was the intention of the movie. Just like the Portland chefs deconstruct dishes ""to make the familiar alien"", the movie takes the premise from a dumb action film and elevates it into a thoughtful art house film. Kinda clever. Definitely one of my favorite of the past year or so. The more people you offend by being succesfull, the more they pay to punch you in the face. Here's my take: guy who runs the fights was emphatic in an earlier scene that nobody remembered Robin (repeated for emphasis in the scene, if I remember correctly).

Then, when Robin writes his full name on the ""next up"" board and an audience made up of restaurant industry folks starts throwing down cash to bet (presumably) on Robin to last the full time, that proves that he is quite well remembered and regarded.

This is why he's handed the paper with info he wants at the end of the scene. I wonder if this is some homage to Chuck  palahniuk who wrote fight club and is a Portland resident. It’s honestly the only thing I can think of because it seems like a weird way to move the plot forward. Think Gordon Ramsey and other asshole cocky chefs, who kicked people off the mountain, to reach the top. Yeah, those same people would pay anything to knock their teeth out. The Fight Club scene was NOT a misstep. Robin Feld (Nick Cage's character) IS the Gordon Ramsey in their world. The Fight Club scene also shows Robin Feld's former self. This explanation should clear up any confusion. I don't think it's right to even call it a revenge movie at all. The entire time he was just trying to get his pig back, not concerned with getting revenge on anyone. Agreed. I’d love to see him get a nomination. My favorite performance so far this year. Yes, indeed. Also could call his revenge simply ""a dish served"". I think it's there to subvert expectations. Normally the main character is the one inflicting violence in order to get what they lost, but here Nic is willing to take the violence to show how serious he is to get his pig back. Truffles aren’t very common anywhere which is why they are so expensive. It’s definitely [a part of Italian culture](https://boxd.it/oiSC) but say “truffles” to an American and they think you mean a French bon bon (chocolate-covered ganache cube). It’s only people really into Italian food and how food is made — definitely Portland people — that would find romance in a pig or dog finding buried mushrooms. I will film it and you will look exactly like Nic Cage in this movie. used to work for a three star chef, been in the industry 13 years and you can definitely tell that actual industry people were consulted for this. I thought there was going to be a little more focus on his cooking and food in general, but I think a lot of the greatness of this film was leaving the right things unsaid and just indirectly referenced, so I’m fine with that. the scene where he goes back to his old restaurant and speaks with his former baker was one of my favorite scenes, and I think the depth of that part could be lost on non-industry viewers. my wife is also in the biz, coincidentally a pastry chef, and she started crying when the baker said “thank you, chef” to robin, and I don’t think the power of that line could be fully understood without some time in the industry. the film also did a really great job of showing, through the various interactions with the industry characters, how robin was simultaneously loved, respected, envied, loathed, and even idolized by his peers. it’s probably going to end up one of my favorite films. >I was amazed at the way the film built tension by establishing a violent tone early.

Yeah, really good point I hadn't considered. For the longest time you're waiting for Robin to finally break into a violent rage at someone, but he never does. If you want to see other great performances by Cage in recent years, I would recommend Mandy and Color Out of Space. This film vs the trailer for it reminds me a LOT of Drive. People went in to that movie thinking it was going to be fast and furious and a lot of them ended up disappointed in what was a very amazing movie. >John Wick but with a big but

Lol Skyline Tavern was instantly recognizable. And im pretty sure I recognized driving on those same roads past those same vineyards and orchards. Couldnt quite place them but believe it was still on Skyline out toward Corny pass. Also the bad dads house. Northwest?

Edit- Skyline not skyland which is also a great bat. Yes [deleted] Yup. Absolutely bizarre someone marked you down because you liked this movie an awful lot. Pathetic really.

Anyway I agree. Best movie I've seen this year thus far. Glad you enjoyed it so much as well. Yeah I went in blind and loved it, my friend went in with the John Wick expectations and liked it but was underwhelmed. You know, it's strange to me. Did people expect an action flick because it has Nic Cage? 

I found out about the movie when my friends posted the trailer in our private discord and were all going on about John Wick...and to me it seemed incredibly obvious we were getting something very subdued and melancholy. 


That said, even I'll admit I wasn't expecting to experience my own existential crisis by the end of the movie. I haven't been so moved by a film in a long, long time. And they did it without any cheap tricks. Well fucking done. That isn't John Malkovich. Yup, they established it well with his scene with chef Fenway. Showing him recalling all those minute details of something that happened over 2 months 15+ years ago was a great setup. What’s the episode of Portlandia where they go the farm to see the chickens they were about to eat?  Fuck yes.  OACU ""Leave No Trace"" is where is at for eating in nature.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3892172/ I'm putting a meal together... Disagree. As much of a nihilist Rob is, he's at peace in that final scene. Robin says if he’d never gone to look for her, she would still be “alive” in his head and Amir replies that no, she wouldn’t. Robin thinks on it and then agrees. Amir cries and puts his seat back, presumably to go to sleep in the car. The next scene shows Robin washing up in the same stream the movie opened with, then returning to his cabin. Why does this story need a happy ending? I thought the actors did ok for what it was but agree with you otherwise. It's self indulgent and heavy handed and just too up it's own ass I don't think it's 'fake deep' at all. It's just a pretty simple story about how we deal with grief & loss and what we'll go through to keep the things we care about close. 

> There was no chemistry between Robin and Amir

Is there really supposed to be? Based on the storyline they meet once a week and rarely ever mutter more than a few words to eachother. Not like they're supposed to have some Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan on-screen chemistry. Unfortunately I agree. I wanted to like the film, and I love Cage. But the movie doesn’t end off all that different. Sure he’s acknowledged his loss, but by the lesson of the movie itself. That doesn’t change anything. Everything that is lost is still lost.

All the random long shots of people staring at stuff, the incredibly wonky audio mixing making some lines indecipherable. Then beyond that, I just didn’t care for Amir. Some young, dumb coward who from the first scene was obviously going to be the cause of the pig getting stolen. Who’s cliche scared/worshipping of his workaholic dad is many generations old now. I just wish there was more revolution. Robin really growing or doing something dramatic, Amir moving away from his father. 

Instead what happens in real life happens here. Stuff is lost, everyone just kinda putters on. Which while realistic is just not what I watch movies to see. I live in that world every day of the week. ""None of it's real. The critics aren't real. The customers aren't real. You're not real. They don't love you. They don't even know you."" Don’t sleep on Willy’s Wonderland - it’s a fun movie. There are a lot of other movies that do that than Ghibli, but yes unpopular opinion I guess but I felt that his acting was the weakest of the whole movie

not that it was bad, but it didn't feel realistic to me whereas everyone else's performance was more grounded. he felt like more of a caricature than a person. 

I still enjoyed the scene, but not how that actor portrayed it The way his facade slowly fades and you see too much teeth and sunken eyes was *chef’s kiss* See, I thought the movie was great and that scene was awesome, but I felt the actor who played the chef oversold it a little bit. Maybe it was intentional, but it felt a little too on the nose and hammy. I wouldn't say his was the best performance in the film by any stretch. Still a great moment though. I agree, David Knell and apparently he was in Total Recall lol the original. The scene gave me heavy Better Call Saul vibes tho I kept thinking he looked like jack mcbrayer haha We don't get a lot of things to really care about. he's a man who chose the more financially viable route instead of chasing his dream and it drains his happiness. it's really clear in that scene

then when Nic Cage talks about remembering every dish, every person he's ever served you can tell it was because he was passionate about what he was serving and who he was serving.

Your mind can immediately link back to Eurydice's food-as-art facade, the waitresses performance (like she's on stage) of presenting the 'deconstructed' scallops, and the chef's expansion on that performance by using flashy lingo to elevate his menu.

When he describes his pub's signature dish he does away with the performance

Robin presents the final meal simply as a dish, of course he provides a little bit of proper wine presentation etiquette but his food speaks for itself. He said it almost pissed off too because he knew what he gave up for his successful restaurant I felt like they were talking about the theme of the movie in general. Like, what goes into making of a dish, really? This movie deconstructs it for us to show us the emotional reality behind it. We take for granted all those little things that go into making food and we miss the love and the human (and pig) element behind it too. Interesting comparison. It was certainly tense, that's for sure. I like your thinking outside of the box for that comparison. Reminded me of [this scene](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TkX-TPaodoM) from *Up in the Air* lol good call, jefe I don't think you know what the word cliche means Does Ratatouille “feel a little cliche” because of Proust then? I watched this last night, and lmao its literally the exact same analysis ben shapiro uses. Music is ""rhythm, harmony, and melody"". All those bits were so comically over-the-top pretentious, I loved it I live in Seattle and could definitely relate. (Also loved the Seattle references). Yeah I live nearby and as soon as he entered I was like ""nice he looks like he belongs here"" Unkempt Nicolas cage in overalls covered in blood is the ultimate motivator. That scene was very uncomfortable to me.  As a dad, all I could see was one of my young kids casually talking to a ""homeless person"" who strolled into my backyard.  Ugh. No, but you don't see any violence done to the pig. The closest you get is when she's taken but it cuts away from her and you just hear her. there is no ""that'll do pig"" moment in this film... >I feel like I'm taking crazy pills, but I'm already rooting for Nic Cage win at the Academy next year for Pig.

Not crazy to me. It's an incredible performance. And I love that people are going to go see this thinking it's an ironic ""Nic Cage does John Wick"" thing and are instead going to be met with a reminder that he's one of our great actors. Idk but I think he's enjoying being in indie movies more than AAA You kinda blew my mind with your third point. Great observation [deleted] Not at all. This is my new favorite movie of all time. I’ve read some pretty harsh reviews about his past films; To me it seems he enjoys doing these indie films specifically over anything. Daniel Radcliffe is notorious for the same. My take is, you’re not always going to get it right but when you do it’s a masterpiece like no other as displayed here. It really gives big blockbusters a run for their money too and shows you you’re being bought out for cheap thrills. I doubt they’ll appreciate this 92 minute film having more acting skills, depth, (the list goes on for more than 92 minutes ironically) then the majority of the huge blockbuster films that have come out in the past decade. For that alone I can see Nicholas Cage being “overlooked” for an award. I do recall recently watching a “Nomadland” and Indie film alike however was grossly horrible from start to end, but won the most prestigious awards. really goes to show whoever hands out these things really have their heads up their asses. I hope he wins, but wouldn’t be surprised if not 🤷‍♂️ not crazy pills hes a great actor he just does a lot of awful films but that doesnt mean he isnt fantastic and cant steal a movie. I work in a restaurant. I'd pay good money to beat the fuck out of some of the kitchen staff I work with for a minute with no repercussions. yeah the fight club scene overall illustrates one of the many outlets people use to deal with emotion, stress, and pain. restaurant industry people, chefs especially, have high rates of addiction and risky behavior due to job stress. the scene is a surrealist take on that. Cage’s behavior during that scene shows us he has nothing left to lose and only cares about the mission at hand: getting his pig back. he knows he needs to gain respect from that dude who said he’s a nobody. in the real world, when people leave the industry it’s often seen as a sign of weakness. he’s proving that he’s not weak. And the dude who beat him up absolutely felt his wrath when he was Chef. I wonder if there's any hopes of an oscar nod or two for this film? to be honest, I could totally believe a chef fight club happens in underground Portland This explanation makes the most sense imo That's what I thought. The first guy looked homeless. Chef only looked homeless because he was a recluse, and by choice. So no way the first guy was a former famous chef as well. I thought it was just a way for restaurant employees to take out their frustrations on willing participants. Screwed up, but at least they get paid. That's what I thought, too. Fallen from grace chefs or others in the industry that need money can go make some money getting beat on by their old employees. > The food industry is notoriously stressful, so the idea of having an underground hobo fight pit tht specifically caters to them doesn't sound so crazy

I mean it absolutely does sound very crazy regardless of the industry. I get what the movie was going for, but that was the one scene that took me out of the movie -- it just felt so out of place in an otherwise grounded (if somewhat quirky) film. Hobos getting paid to be beaten up is not only not new to film but it was an actual thing back in the early 2000s (look up Bumfights / or don't). I saw this movie in Seattle and everyone laughed when he said it Lol fuck Springfield amirite? 

-Shelbyvillians Saw it last night in PDX and there we were laughing at all the Portland shit like the waitress explaining the dish 🤣  Never thought about that. Good insight, I like that. Amir did seem to relish being able to say ""Robin Feld sent me"". If he simply walked off and the movie ended, I would assume suicide. But I don't think so. The end scene of him taking off his boots and listening to the tape feels more like he's ready for a new beginning, not an end. Interesting take. I felt he was reborn and starting again, ready to grieve. But I can see what you're saying. Throughout the entire film he never bothered to clean himself up until he got home. I don't think he would've done that if he just planned on killing himself Oh, I'm very well aware, having watched both the good and the bad.  The other ones have been a bit more niche than this one, though, which actually seems to be drumming up some conversation.  A lot of people just remember him for the memes, and I'm hoping this makes people aware of his resurgence. Unfortunately, most people didn't see Joe.  Plus he had a drought of a few years after that where he didn't  have anything good except The Trust.  Mom and Dad kind of brought him back from that. As much as I enjoy Nic Cage and respect him as an actor, I do admit that he has a few duds where even he doesn't bring anything to the table (such as The Runner and USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage).  But for the most part you are correct. It's possible. Do you like maps? Just saw the movie and late to this convo, but I think there’s a parallel there when he goes to his old restaurant and now it’s a bakery run by his old baker. Same passion, same skill level, just a new business. Not better or worse, just different. I read somewhere that the fruit from that tree is only edible when it’s very ripened. He never got a chance to have his family with his wife, his life was inedible and never became ripened due to the loss of his wife Its an interesting theory but to me, the speech about the tsunami was just Rob showing the audience just how nihilist he now is. Since he lost his wife he realised that nothing matters other than the connections you make between people and he stopped caring for anything. Very good catch. That was probably the only line in this movie that I didn’t really understand and just took as random “eccentric dude” convo. With Cage’s character that wouldn’t make sense however - everything he said had some sort of purpose and deeper meaning. This makes a lot of sense, thank you.

I on the other hand have one question (watched the movie tonight), and instead of getting buried in the comments I’ll just ask here - Amir’s mother was not dead, but in hospital (presumably some sort of mental institution), right? But instead of explaining all this to Robin, he takes the “easy route” of telling him she killed herself? It wasn’t talked about at all, was waiting for at least a comment about it in the dinner scene. But I suppose it’s open to interpretation - maybe Amir and his dad feel like they’ve lost her because of mental illness or dementia or something, and don’t want to talk about it because of trauma. jesus…good catch. i think youre right. a tragic death would explain his retreat from society. i also kinda wondered if he knew amir’s mom? his reaction when he hears she’s ‘dead’ seemed a little heartbroken and then his weird interaction with amir’s dad about ‘when did you get like this’ made it seem like they might have all been connected. I just watched matchstick men again for the first time since not came out. That movie is so good. People seem to like to shit on nic cage but his dumb movies in no way diminish his good ones. And Mandy! Agreed, black comedy vibes but somehow also a serious contemplation of grief. Somehow balanced perfectly between self-awareness of its own ridiculousness, and a deep-dive into melancholy. ""Fuck Seattle"" I missed that. Do you remember which scene? It was a good movie with decent cinematography but the color palette was fucking abysmal. This was almost zack Snyder's Pig. it's 90 minutes long. And it utterly broke down the pretentiousness in high end dining Me too! 

No one even mentioned it even though he was entering eating establishments. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnSgam75Bmo) you go! It was the first thing i looked for after the movie ended. You can also find it on Spotify. Whoa I had no idea he got married for the fifth time. She's 27, even younger than me... Can't imagine marrying a husband 30 years older than me. > He just got married to some Japanese girl after dating long distance through the pandemic for like…less than a year. 

Imagine... in a year you could meet someone interesting online, chat with them, turns out your online crush is actually /r/onetruegod and now you're getting married! Poor Nic. He seems intent to become a poor man. I heard he believed that he was born in the year of the dragon (1964) and he got himself a huge dragon tattoo back piece. Hes done much weirder things than this such as naming his son after Supermans alien name Kal-el, so I can completely believe this. 

Unfortunately he then he found out the Chinese new year starts in February and not January. This meant that he fucked up and therefore he was actually born in the year of the of the rabbit. 

However, the Chinese and Japanese years share their animals, and the Japanese year starts in January, so he wified his Japanese girlfriend. No wonder he rambled on about haikus and somesuch in an interview about Pig. It was such a random thing to bring up. The empty pet bed + song rendition just broke me after losing our family cat last year. I got misty-eyed when i realized he was cooking that guy that same meal he'd enjoyed with his wife. but snowpiercer is incredibly straightforward... is that lady stupid or something? My personal favorite was seeing Terrance Malick's Tree of Life, credits roll, and a person in front of me says to the other ""Man, they really need to cut Nova's budget.""

I loved the movie, but that did give me a good chuckle at the time. My favorite was after The Fellowship of the Ring and some idiot behind me goes ""That's it?!  That's all there is?"" I watched Mother for the first time a couple weeks ago and man I wish I could have seen that in theaters. I was just picturing the Friday night crowd showing up for the new JLaw movie. > The movie was marketed as a John Wick knock off 

Was it, though? The only violence in the trailer was when he got knocked out and none of the rest of it indicated it would be a violent revenge fantasy like John Wick. People joked that it would be like John Wick or Taken but that's more due to audience speculation than anything the movie advertising itself actually portrayed. I was thinking more of Mandy.  He's out in the wilderness, covered in blood, obsessed with a goal.  I figured there'd be some serious massacres going on. Fucking forreal. I didn't think this movie was that wierd! I thoroughly enjoyed absorbing the performances. Nic obviously but Alex Wolff too Other guy was amazing. Emoting the strained ""pleasant face"" so that other patrons think everything is fine and that he isn't at all unraveling from the inside. Nick Cage staring down into his soul. Alex Wolfe looking on in astonishment. An instant classic of a scene. ""We dont get a lot of things to really care about.""

*cries* Yeah the way it unfolded was great. At first you think it's gonna be some bullshit just to try to mess with the guy, then it gets real. ""The critics aren't real, the customers aren't real. None of this is real. You dedicate your life to these people and they will never care about you. None of them know who you are because you haven't shown them."" I could really feel like this was something Robin had to learn the hard way and that was part of the reason he was the way he was when the movie starts. But yeah it really reminds me to put more of myself into my art. He's a great actor, though I've only seen him in Hereditary and Pig.  Enough to prove to me he has chops. Very much agreed. He definitely gave the character some good dimension and was able to balance the cocky attitude with underlying self doubt and approval-seeking. Nic Cage is in a lot bad movies but he's almost never bad in a movie. Hey GR is top tier film One of my favorite movies this last year Nicolas Cage literally didn't speak the entire movie. The Wally's Wonderland movie with the serial killer animatronic characters. It was such a stupid concept and so ridiculous, but he just absolutely nailed the character, taking his breaks on schedule. Freakin hilarious and I just think it was such a perfect role for him. A bird, a bottle and a salted baguette I think 2 was Mom's French toast and deconstructed scallops. I forget 3 but I think the word bottle was in there somewhere? a bit late to the party, but here are the segment titles

1. Rustic Mushroom Tart

2. Mom's French Toast & Deconstructed Scallops

3. A bird, a Bottle, & a Salted Baguette Ahhh, my shitty memory!

Edit- or maybe the pee break i took happened right on the transition Same here, movie was way too dim. Could barely see a thing during the pig snatching scene but i was like this is definitely the point, im not really supposed to see whats going on, and then it cuts to an outdoor shot of the woods during the daytime and it still looks incredibly dim Not just me! Thanks for the sanity check lol A very poignant scene, it just sucks that IRL it is literally impossible for everyone to do what they want and what they're passionate about because society wouldn't work. Good analysis. I do think that this film offers a lot more than the surface. This is evidenced by the amount of time and focus it spends on certain scenes, e.g. the deconstruction scene and the scenes highlighting Robin’s past. The best films don’t spoon feed everything because the process of filling in the gaps provides those emotional “aha” moments. Wow, what an awesome observation - I think you are absolutely right I think it might  be highest bidder gets to beat the guy up? And I'm assuming he let the guy beat him so that the Edgar guy would make all the money people had bet on Rob? So that Edgar would then give him the info on the pig. Idk if that's right but that's what I thought when watching it. Edgar told Rob that now he worth nothing, he go over there to show him he was wrong, when he puts his name on the wall the people became nuts to win to punch him... after 15 years outside people still compite and pay money to be with him a few minutes,  
and (i think) this represent that Money can give you revenge or happiness but just for a brief amount of time...  


This films has a lot of layers that make me to love it so much.... And anyone he 'hurt,' it was for their own betterment in the end. Yea its not like he left the two methheads in a ditch somewhere. Chiming in a week late but I just wanted to say I think you are absolutely correct. I’m surprised so many people weren’t so hot on this aspect of the movie. 

My favorite part of this movie was how well it’s set up to seem like a John Wick revenge-porn movie up until this point. Like once Nic Cage shows up in this fight club style basement explaining the underbelly of the restaurant industry, it really seems like it’s going to go down a very cliche “guy with dangerous past comes back to take revenge” path. I think this twist is what makes the movie so incredible. It’s a beautiful piece that shows how stupid the idea of revenge is and how important it is to really care about the people/animals in your life. Not to knock too hard on Joh Wick, cause it is a fun movie, but our media is saturated with blood soaked revenge stories. It takes real bravery to confront someone who has hurt you with genuine kindness instead. I think the problem most people had -- at least the one *I* had -- is that the scene just felt out of place. Even granting the whole 'it's there to subvert revenge-film expectations' explanation that's a bit too meta of a scene to include in an otherwise pretty grounded film. Maybe it works on this 'commentary on revenge films' level, but on a plot and character level it really takes you out of the story because it doesn't fit in with the universe of the rest of the film. The rest of the movie doesn't seem that concerned with this kind of meta-commentary at the sake of plot and realism -- it's a pretty well done, grounded and realistic portrayal of loss and grief. Even if it does have its quirks, the story never quite breaks with reality other than in the fight club scene.

I still loved the film, though. But that scene didn't do it for me. Just a quick question. Why would a big businessman have to steal a pig? Is there a shortage of pigs? I am also not familiar with 'truffles.' Could you expand on the significance of the ""thank you, chef"" line? It -felt- powerful to me and I couldnt really put my finger on why. I was in the navy formerly, and i noticed that it looked like she was standing 'at ease' and the use of the title struck me as very familiar from my time in the service. But I would love to hear about the significance from someone in the industry. Its alright lol, whoever  downvoted me prolly didnt like The Lighthouse  either. [removed] It's the pilot I'm pretty sure. Leave no Trace and Pig might be giving One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest a run for its money as best movies filmed and set in Oregon. And then, crucially, he realizes that he had been scared of playing the mixtape his wife gave him for the same reason and so he finally comes to terms with the loss of his wife and plays the mixtape. Schrodinger's Pig So sorry, definitely poor wording on my part. I was wondering what the scene was like at the diner prior to them leaving and going outside.. if there was any important dialogue that led to Amir crying that I missed That’s appropriate, he was a caricature of a chef at this point My experience was that the person was affecting a chef caricature because he *wasn’t* a chef, though he could well have been a great pub restaraunt manager:

“We’re deconstructing local ingredients and thereby exploring, blah blah bullshit.”

It reminds me of Owen Wilson’s Cormac McCarthy parody in *The Royal Tenenbaums*. “Wildcat was written in…an obsolete vernacular.” I felt this in the beginning when he first introduced himself but that played in to his character of being not real > was chef’s kiss

you motherfuckrer I think he was trying to be overly nice and expressive because it was his persona for the critics and customers. It faded the more robin cut into him. > of course he provides a little bit of proper wine presentation etiquette

I was under the impression that it was the same wine from their favorite dinner date night as well, and the taste/smell helped elevate the sense driven memories to flood back and cause the crying. I believe he made the exact dish and wine pairing of the evening they had. I thought it was a really nice touch how he had the son help as well and then gave him the nod for ""finding"" the wine. It was a vintage Amarone (della Valpolicella?) red wine. 

Full bodied, very nice to serve with heavier dishes.

Can recommend Were there any references beyond, ""I'm not moving to Seattle."" ""Fuck Seattle."" those cries are terrible. 😥 can't understand how people can eat pigs. In the ending credit, the sound of the pig appeared. I didn’t see many discussions on that (well I'm pretty sure she's dead but that feels significant at least mentally/emotionally) Much appreciated, thanks >  And I love that people are going to go see this thinking it's an ironic ""Nic Cage does John Wick"" thing

This was me. Still thoroughly enjoyed the movie but I think it would have hit better had I not had that expectation. It will be a fucking travesty if he isn't at least nominated. This is the best performance I've seen all year (in my humble opinion of course). heard Ah, spotted the Chili's worker. hot behind Yes, I believe they knew each other in the past. The stare down with each other and the cards dropping said it all. 

Plus Robs line at the end I remember every meal I served to every person. He remembered the man that gave him some punches. I didn’t even think about that but you’re totally right. He probably fired him too Oscar noms usually all come out at the same time in December ish but what do I know You broke the first rule. They always say “keep Portland weird” what a hilarious, amazing concept I saw it with my dad and he laughed I guess there's a level of open to interpretation for sure Also got that sense because of washing/cleansing himself in the river, which is often used as a “rebirth” metaphor. Why not? Lots of suicides dress up, it's pretty common. Mandy was the return to form I wanted from him after Joe came out. I'm even later to this conversation, but the comment about the curtains really solidifies this feeling, Love this interpretation. I couldn't figure out what the persimmon tree/ripeness was a metaphor for. My take was that she attempted suicide but ended up in an endless coma as a result or blew most of her brains out but not quite enough to finish the job or something horrific like that and the dad feels responsible because he was a huge asshole in the marriage. I just assume it's a lot easier to tell strangers that your mom died rather than explain the intricacies of it all. His response to Robyn earlier in the film represents both his caginess with his truffle finding friend and his inability to grieve his mother's ""death."" Even if she's still alive, she's clearly gone. And he can't grieve her until his breakthrough at the very end of the film. Not a mental institution, she was trached on a vent, so an LTAC. Could have been from attempted suicide, or anything really that leaves you brain dead but not dead dead. Great point. Everything seemed to be somewhat connected in this film. So many intricate and beautiful parallels as well The truffle dealer immediately losing her shit when Cage told her his pig was stolen got the biggest laugh from me. “I don’t fuck my pig” I saw this movie in a relatively crowded downtown Seattle theater yesterday. That was probably the biggest laugh for the crowd, haha. Sitting in a theatre by myself in Seattle. Made me chuckle lol Just saw this tonight, in Seattle. Everyone had a good hearty laugh at that scene When Amir is talking to the guy at the back door of the restaurant they use to get to the fight club. He says that Robin is his dad’s friend and he’s showing him around and that he’s a Buddhist. One of the reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes skewered this film because of the colors.  Called it ""Vimeo-link theater"".  

But I think the city fit those colors perfectly.  Portland \*is\* gray. Awesome, thank you! >Can't imagine marrying a husband 30 years older than me.

Keanu Reeves is in his 50s.

Just saying. Yeah of all the movies to go ""WTF just happened"". I understand it when someone says that after a David Lynch film. But Snowpiercer? Unless you slept through half the film or are a total dumbass, it's extremely straightforward. Yea I mean its literally just a sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory I saw Tree of Life in a theater that the A/C failed about a third of the way through the movie and my boyfriend at the time wouldn't leave and made me suffer through the remaining 19 hours of that movie.  I fucking hate that movie. Tbf, that's a pretty smart joke lol incredible 

still remember watching Fellowship in theatres as a kid, and that final shot of mount doom in the distance spewing lava will always stick with me It’s also that it stars Nicolas Cage. I love him and know that he’s capable of moving performances like the one he gave here, but without clarifying information it’s really easy to assume a movie with him as the lead would go in that direction. The story was clearly inspired by John Wick.  The writer/director didn't just accidentally make a movie with the same basic plot of one of the biggest movies of the last decade. The smart move is he made it in an entirely different genre.  

The story is >!a mythical figure in an underground world that has left his past to live a simpler life.  When somebody from his old life hurts his beloved pet it forces him to return and work his way up through old contacts until he finds so is responsible.  When people learn who he is they are in awe of him.!<. 

That's identical to the pitch for John Wick. Pig replaces action for drama and fighting with cooking.  That's not a knock on it.  I loved the movie and think it's a great idea to reuse plot structures in different genre. Yea I definitely did not get ""John Wick"" vibes from the original trailer lol.

To be fair though, I feel like anytime someone sees ANY action in a trailer nowadays though, they always default to ""Well, here's another John Wick.."" His teeth were also so naturally long and pointy it started to mess with me after a bit while he was trying to hold his smile The name of his favorite dish escaping his lips immediately, without hesitation betraying his whole façade was fantastic. The bit that got me was when his ex employee hugged him in the bakery and called him chef. For sure. I love how the movie was made to let us fill in the blanks. I imagine the loss of his wife led to an existential crisis of sorts where he began to question reality itself. 


Beautiful Mount Hood in the background, which we're informed is an active volcano. We pretend that it is beauty and marvel personified, but deep down in the belly is a reminder of what it takes to make that beauty. And once you've been exposed to that, in this case, literal underground, you can never look at it the same. 


Fantastic movie. just reading this dialogue (i'm not sure if it is direct quote or not) made me shiver again. The scene in finway's restaraunt where Rob is talking about how his dad seems like he sucks and Amir is just dowplaying it and is clearly in denial about it, was such a good moment from Alex. unless bees are involved First ghost rider is alright. Entertaining enough.

The second one though... I saw that about a month ago and I loved it. Just craziness all the way. This unironically ""say's alot about are society"". When it comes to taking it's time, I really enjoyed how long it takes for Robin to get up after getting pummeled. Made me understand that even if he was willing to go through with it to get what he wanted, it doesn't make it easy. Ya that's what it seemed like to me. I think the idea was that the guy punching him probably used to work for him. Except for the guy who got his bike stolen lmao She probably thought she would never see Rob again. So she took this opportunity to thank him for all that he has done for her, and say goodbye. Typically, “thank you chef” is a humble expression of gratitude for the compliment the chef (your superior) has given you for your work. Yeah especially up until the underground fight scene it is being played like a straight John Wick opening.  Even after that the structure still mirrors a typical revenge flick. It just turns out the skills he has from his time as a chef are self expression, compassion, and reading people rather than ability to murder people. Ohh. I don’t believe they say much, if anything . Defeated silence. Robin does say something like see you next Thursday but you likely saw that part. Hope someone else can fill you in! true, I suppose it could've been intentional

still loved the movie regardless. his performance was the only one that seemed to break my immersion, but it still wasn't bad Yes, he was practically reciting a script. 

The way he said the local truffle industry is expanding twice, he had that talking point in his pocket for when he talked to customers. 

The deconstructing local ingredients bullshit came directly off the website, I am sure. 

I thought his acting sold the scene very well, as intended. Definitely, I got that vibe as well, that he really didn't want to be doing all that fake pretentious locally-sourced high-end restaurant stuff, but I just felt that his execution of it felt like a caricature because he was overacting it.

Like everyone else in the movie felt like a real person to me, acting in as they would in their natural environments. He was the only one who felt like he was forcing it. To be fair that was one of the harder roles, having to react to Robin's speech, but it didn't come off as realistic to me personally. Everyone knows custer died at little big horn I think it was the whole meal from that night No. And that's the point. The flavor of bacon outweighs the flavor of guilt. Many don't realize how similar pigs are to dogs, and many who do bury that knowledge for the sake of their tastebuds. I gave up meat four years ago (only eat a bit of fish now) and this is what I always tell people who act shocked and say they could never give up bacon. Pigs are incredibly smart, loyal and familial creatures. They have just as much personality as dogs - if not more so than many breeds, tbh - and are not the dirty, dumb swine they are often portrayed as. If you ever hear the cries a mother pig makes when her piglets are taken from her, it's horrifying. They will mope and refuse to eat when their young ones are taken away. 

I get that animals kill one another and it's the circle of life and I'm not some wacky vegan who feeds my cat plant based meals, or tries to throw blood on people's fur coats. I'm pretty realistic and non judgmental about it. I realize this is, to an extent, the way the world spins. But I want no part of factory farming and personally, I also just have no desire to eat those animals anymore. Humans have evolved to show sympathy and empathy and not engage in animalistic behavior. We aren't raping and murdering other humans anymore either, because we understand the cruelty of these actions; so the idea that ""people have killed animals for thousands of years"" or whatever is kind of a moot point in my mind, because by the same logic you could try to defend other acts humans used to engage in.

People act absolutely OUTRAGED when dogs or cats are abused or hurt (rightfully so! It horrifies me too) and yet so many of these people will bury their head in the sand to justify eating that bacon strip. (Which, by the way, really only tastes good because of the insane amounts of salt and seasoning they put on it. If you've ever had bacon cooked in nothing but its own fat, it really doesn't have the signature flavor. Most meats without seasoning aren't really that flavorful - that's why we sell rubs and dips and glazes and everything else, and why you can put the same seasoning on seitan for example and pretty much have it taste exactly the same.) Can we just talk about the damn movies without anything to do with an animal turning into a vegan circlejerk Same, I refuse to eat pork. They're sweet animals. Modern society makes it very easy to forget about where and how the commodities in front of us came to be. Industrialized slaughter of near-sentient animals, horrific labor conditions, environmental destruction - impossible to escape becoming implicated in these things even if you're fully aware of everything. So its easy - too easy - to just become a nihilist about it. All animals cry when they die. Kinda weird to only be sympathetic for pigs. Either go vegan or eat everything, don't waver in  between with performative sympathy. Actually, the pig doesn’t necessarily die in the movie.  The very beginning of chapter two opens wide on the sun streaming through the woods and the pig walking by itself.  Then it cuts to French toast breakfast in the apartment.  I guess you might interpret it as the dream Nicolas Cage is having before he wakes to breakfast…or it could be that the pig is alive wandering the woods.  The end of the movie in the diner parking lot Nicolas Cage looks off in the distance as if he senses something (the pig being alive?) and decides to walk home.  The pig is not shown with Nicolas Cage back in the cabin but the music is lovely and upbeat and you half expect the pig to enter the scene. I really recommend the movie. It's a wonderful tale of loss and how we cope with loss. It's a pretty flawless movie. Nothing wasted. I know you posted this 71 days ago but I really wish it was just yesterday and I could tell you to NOT watch it after your previous comment asking whether pig makes it or not and if she doesn’t you probably won’t watch it.

I wish others would take this into consideration andNOT try to still convince you to watch it. 1. That’s annoying and wrong of them to do. 2. I was RUINED by the end knowing the pig didn’t make it. I mean crying very hard. I literally felt awful and depressed. I am incredibly close to one of my cats. I’m not a mother and not sure if I’ll ever have a kid yet, but this one cat brings out all the mother instincts. I’ve never loved anything as much as this cat. 

Knowing how he feels about his pig I could relate and it literally broke me. The end broke me. Emotionally I was too upset to critique this film from a more rational standpoint. Plus movies are subjective.

Emotionally I was too ruined to enjoy this movie and ended up hating it 86 - your face I rarely see what I consider a *perfect* comment, but this is right on the edge. Well done. Alternatively, a preparation for burial, c.f. Jesus I'm basing it on his character It’s such a well-written movie, there’s a lot to unpack with it! Remember that ""You don't know what I am"" phrased most pointedly as a threat?

This menace that he says it with is pure self loathing transmuted on the inside into a ""stay back"" snarl wrapped around a lie. That guy hates himself so much he built a castle around the hate and told himself a story that it was strength just to cope with that pain. And then someone who gave him one of the best experiences he ever had in his life, who bared his soul to him with his craft that he had mastered, did it again after he went through the exact same grief he had been through. And he remembered. And he understood what he had done. And he felt deep, deep shame and grief for it.

And some things you just can't take back. Why was every date night punctuated with fights and drama? What made that guy who he was? What hardened him? He cared too once upon a time, and he let it fade and slip away and told himself a story to make that okay. But it never is. You can't take that back, either.

I could be wrong. But imho that was one of the best scenes in all history. That line made me bark I grew up in rural Oregon, Portland was our pride.  Seattle was never to be talked about. Also saw it in a theater in Seattle, only I was with my wife and there were like 10 elderly people in with us. We were the only ones who laughed. Exceptions can be made Yeah but he breathtaking 😂 I guess...but not really. Dudes got some amazingly emotional roles I mean, he only cooks like... one meal? 

I think John Wick killed a LOT more than 2 people. For the record, the co-writer/director mentioned on a podcast (The Big Picture), that John Wick was not the inspiration and he completed the script with his co-writer well before either of them had even seen John Wick. He could certainly be lying but I don't really get that impression based on the interview.

His co-writer talks about why [she doesn't view the comparison as making a ton of sense in an interview](https://www.thewrap.com/pig-writer-nicolas-cage-john-wick/). 

I do agree that they share some basic plot similarities but there is a huge difference between plot and story. The story John Wick tells is very much a revenge driven fantasy. The story Pig tells is way more introspective and focused on the actual feelings one reckons with when a loved one is gone. While I love the first John Wick movie, it simply isn't that deep at the end of the day. If anything, Pig fully subverts the vengeance wish fulfillment fantasy that audiences have come to expect from films like this, which pushes it even further away from Wick territory. i think more broadly Pig replaces violence with compassion and empathy.. but yeah the john wick inspiration seems spot on John Wick didn't start this.  You should see the movie Red, it came out years before Wick and was basically the same exact plot. The comparison is because the plot is kicked off because something happens to their pets I was wondering who she was supposed to be. Wasn’t sure if it was a daughter or just former coworker That part made me cry more than when I found out what happened to the pig 100%. I got a bit emotional during this scene. Just seeing how much the memory of a specific loaf of bread can mean to someone. This movie was so good. He was definitely in crises mode, probably had a mental illness, maybe general anxiety disorder. This often develops when people suffer shocking losses or traumatic events. Common behavior of GAD is continuously bracing yourself for the worst possible outcome of a given scenario to prevent yourself from ever getting so caught off guard and hurt again. This rang true for me when he was telling Amir about the earthquake he was certain was going to hit the west coast soon. Excuse me but his performance was flawless in that movie Yeah there could be a whole industry where people get to beat the shit out their former abusive bosses. I think that was the point. He is just one of those guys who are so painfully fake with every word of every sentence and they think they’ve fooled everybody, when in reality they’re trying so hard their fakeness beams right through. Down to the wine, for sure. Not for me it doesn't. I'd eat dog. Hail seitan. :)

Seasoned cauliflower crumbles are also an incredible substitute for bacon bits on salads or anything else. Anyone who thinks rice is boring should try aged basmati (e.g. Royal Himalayan) with cauliflower crumbles on top. Lmao pigs are most definitely sentient. Oh for sure. If people were involved in the slaughter and prep of the animals there would be hundreds of millions of more vegetarians and vegans. 

The planet would love it. Along with the pigs and cows living in filth and misery. *You're* breathtaking I’m thinking she may have been the baker at his restaurant when she worked there The bees let him down that's a fair take, maybe it was exaggerated to put emphasis on that, but I feel like that could've been conveyed without feeling overacted, but that's just my opinion. And that's okay too If dogs tasted as good as pigs, they’d be served at every restaurant. Absolutely! So much of people's misperceptions about the ""flavor"" of meat vs other foods comes down to sheer laziness, tbh. It's easier to prep and cook a strip steak than it is to make certain plant-based dishes, but I often find the flavor faaaar better and more complex. I mean look at how flavorful and amazing Indian cuisine is, for example, and yet the majority of their dishes tend to qualify as vegetarian. That makes sense to me more than daughter and the fact she referred to him as chef I think she was just the baker he sourced his bread from, and his wife worked with. The curtains comment alluded to that imo. Not necessarily an employee. Stupid amateur bees I kind of agree, the performance clashed with the rest of the movie. It was a movie filled with subdued, very realistic acting and the guy was clearly acting. I could actually see that scene feeling more natural on a rewatch since you’d know where it’s going. Taste just really isn't a good excuse For sure. She also did the hands behind the back stance thing that the employees do. He was probably her mentor. He tells her you turned it into a bakery.  I think they were at his old restaurant? She says she kept it the same for a few years thinking he'd come back but he never did. I didn't see his character as ""acting."" Whenever he got interrupted, he would repeat the concept of his restaurant, verbatim but when interrupted again, he stumbled painfully. Because someone fed him the concept for his OWN restaurant; his heart not being in it and that's why the scene both works and is also painfully awkward to watch. He's by no means the only person dying a slow death doing something they hate. What's a little different is that his restaurant is wildly popular and he's well-compensated for it. What? Who cares? I got the same impression plus that she was exceptionally talented like Rob and he recognized it and was grooming her to be a Chef like him but her talent and love was in being a master baker and not a chef. Which he understood and respected, so much so he took an extra piece of her bread. 

Also got the impression she was friends with his wife. My favorite moment in the film. Getting a little misty thinking about it two weeks later. The living beings who suffer and the people who see that? Lol. I was responding to your ""and that's okay to"" to point out that it's really not okay and taste is a poor excuse. It's not a case of eating and not eating pig is equally good For me the extra bread read as a recognition that he had reached a new level with Amir. He was thinking of him and wanted to get him one too. ",0
88,"I noticed when they all showed up to the festival, the elder who greeted them turned to each of the 3 males in the group and said ""Welcome"", but when he turned to Dani he said ""Welcome home"" im guessing that pelle's parents sacraficed themselves in the yellow house and that's how they died? and that's why his brother did it? they have a queen and a yellow house burns down every summer right or just every 90 years that part was unclear to me Somebody please tell me if I'm looking too much into it, but...

I thought it was interesting that Pelle described life as 4 seasons, with spring being birth/childhood and winter being old age/death. If I'm not wrong, the movie begins in winter with the death of her family and the midsommar festival takes place at the end of spring, yes? Is this supposed to be... rebirth into her new ""family""? I dunno.

Edit: yeah so it definitely is summer by the time of the festival I guess. For some reason I thought somebody said it ended on the summer solstice. There was a lot of stuff to pay attention to, I got distracted lol. The only hereditary-esque moment for me where I just felt like I was being gripped by something awful was the beginning when we see suddenly see what has become of Dani's family. Suicide tends to really emotionally get to me and that scene made me cry in the theater, just the sheer weight of realization and emotions of people you care about being erased. I know a lot of people are praising its cinematography, but I gotta give a shout-out to the sound design team. Very little ambient sounds - lots of scenes almost feel like people are talking in a vacuum.

And then ambience picks up again when they trip. Something I bet a lot of folks may not notice but a subconsciously effective way of inciting general unease.

EDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention was that because of the intentionally minimalistic sound design/mixing combined with using multiple channels for dialogue in a lot of scenes, whenever i heard whispering I’d freak out - only to realize it was a couple or whomever whispering to each other in the theater. I really want to go back and look at all the paintings in Dani’s apartment. Pelle to Christian in the beginning - “Think of all Swedish women you can impregnate in June.” 😳 I couldn’t help but notice the amount of long shots in that movie that must have been very difficult to film. 

One that really stood out to me was the one dinner scene where the two elders sit down and then everyone synchronized picks up their utensils one by one in this sweeping overhead shot of the table. That shot felt like porn to me. I'm losing movie recommendation privilege for a few weeks with my wife as a result of this one. This was the weirdest possible movie for an Austin Powers namedrop Dancing Queen would have been a neat choice for the credits. I’ve never seen Florence Pugh in anything before, but holy shit she is so good in this. It’s been said a million times already I’m sure, but she made me feel her pain and grief so deeply. That first scene where she trips and has a panic attack after Will (who is also phenomenal in his role) mentions family broke my heart and made me so anxious. I’m seriously impressed by this film as a whole, but her role especially. I felt so sorry for her. Honestly, I’ve never seen a more realistic depiction of psychedelics in a movie. I felt high just from watching it. Does anyone else have a take on the mirror motif? There are at least half a dozen shots where characters are framed through their reflection in a mirror. They're always looking at someone else -- which could be interpreted as a failure to introspect. When Christian is inside the bear at the end, they say something to the effect of ""reflect on your wickedness."" The exception to this being during Dani's bad trip, when seeing her own reflection snaps her out of it.

There's also the psychological concept of [mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_\(psychology\)) -- something the Harga do to empathize with and comfort one another.

I saw Christian's major flaw as refusing to believe Dani. He is chronically unsupportive and challenges Dani every chance he gets. The Harga, on the other hand, are empathetic to the extreme. When Dani is crying on the floor of the cabin with the women surrounding her, they are quite literally *mirroring* her pain. I think for the first time, Dani sees herself in another person. And the events that follow make perfect sense.

TL;DR mirrors are a metaphor for empathy One of my favorite parts was in the prologue during Dani and Christian’s argument about his plans to leave for the festival. Just seeing him turn the argument around on her and making her force an apology and a plea to stay was really well done, and it showed the relationship’s dependency issues in a way that didn’t feel too in your face. My favorite moment is during the final scene when the building is burning and Pelle’s brother has the faintest look of doubt. Genuinely chilling. This movie takes post-nut clarity to a whole new level. Best match cut in a movie (Dani running into the apartment bathroom which cuts to the airplane bathroom) I've seen in quite some time. Well done. After now seeing Florence Pugh and Toni Collette’s absolutely guttural howls of despair, I am convinced Ari Aster is the master of directing realistic, gut-wrenching grief. Did anyone else’s theater lose its shit when the lady started singing into Christians hand during the sex scene and he’s just looking at her [like](https://media1.tenor.com/images/fbd3104bd1edd2462920ce542c1a561d/tenor.gif?itemid=9909518) Ultimately, I think the movie is about the importance of sharing grief with family and friends who care about you. The scene with the other women all mirroring the main character crying is a great visual representation of the message as they all try to feel her pain to help her heal. Anyone else like this movie, but confused to the degree they like it? I don't know if I'd buy it, see it again even, and would have to be extremely selective about who I recommend it to, but I still liked it. 

I think it's interesting that both this and Hereditary end with the cults winning- maybe that isn't the right word, but our protagonists certainly don't come out on top in either film. Did anybody else notice any faces in the trees in the background? I swear i kept seeing stuff. This is a great example of what a director, editor and score can do for a film. If you read the screenplay it comes off a lot scarier and darker. The final cut the entire film felt like a fairytale even with all the gore. There wasn't any judgement and the cult wasn't made to look evil at all. The most jarring thing about the cult was them juxtaposed with all the outsiders. The score is happily chugging along and victoriously celebrating the rituals while the main characters are just there inevitably perishing. There was no big realization by the characters that evil was coming from them. They just experienced Midsommar. Does anyone think there was any significance to the baby that kept crying while everyone was trying to sleep ? Anyone else think Pelle lied about the festival only happening every 90 years? This film lives or dies by whether you feel like the cult mimicking each others emotions was actually earnest empathy or just them trying to feel sympathy for others pains. Is the summary up top written in a vaguely Swedish accent? Hot Girl Midsommar is officially on “I think I ate her pubic hair”

“Yes that’s probably right”

This movie is next level hysterical Do not go into this expecting hereditary. Just got out about 30 minutes ago. The movie has layers, just ones that are not the easiest to pick up on. Is it about grief? Cheating? The lack of empathy we give others when they need it most? My head is still spinning but I can only review this with one word. Absurd. I read that Ari Aster was going through a difficult break up when he made this film.

That makes a whole lot of sense. [deleted] *The lungs were still breathing. He was still alive.*

Holy shit. It's amazing how the movie uses comedy to make the audience feel even more disoriented. It goes from a traumatic violent scene to a scene of full on comedy and it just leaves the viewer more baffled. Was Mark's corpse wearing a jester hat in that final scene? Ari Aster really has a thing for close-up shots of mutilated heads. And for deformed children. And people burning alive. I have no clue how I'm going to explain what happened in that movie coherently at work tomorrow Will Poulter’s shrooms trip was comedy gold I’m fucking exhausted How much do you think I’d have to pay to get an older, slightly chubby woman support my butt when thrusting to get the most out of my 4 inches as possible? The unofficial list of Ari Aster film Oscar snubs:

Hereditary - Toni Collette's wailing scene and dinner table scene

Midsommar - Will Poulter freaking out on shrooms So she lost her entire family at the start of the film. And the rest was her gaining a new one? (learning rituals, traditions, customs, etc). The carbon monoxide murder/suicide was fkn intense and as weird as this sounds.... soooo well done/shot/portrayed. One of the best scenes of the movie BF’s last words were “I don’t wanna have a bad trip” then proceeded to have the worst trip of all time So this movie is a demented version of The Wizard of Oz. As they enter the village they are greeted by a path of yellow flowers. 

The three Dani travels with mirror the three Dorothy travels with. Her boyfriend is heartless, Josh is seeking knowledge, and Mark was afraid (dare I say cowardly?) of the bugs and is visibly nervous most of the time there.

Pelle describes the loss of his family, and how the commune is his family and his family is his home. Dani has lost her family and this has lost her home much like Dorothy. The difference is she chooses to stay in her version of Oz.

This is all foreshadowed in the beginning as you can see a picture of Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz on the fridge in Josh’s apartment and the lion picture in her bedroom. the choking sound the guy sitting next to me made when he realized why christian's drink was orange compared to everyone else's yellow.... chef's kiss My mans went in with the pencil dive. Were there other people wearing normal clothes when they arrived (other than the couple from Britain)? I could've sworn there were. If so I'm guessing it was the cult's way of making it seem like there were more people from outside, in order to make their adaption process easier. Pretty sure I'm going to Pride as a floral slug now. Really great central theme of finding a good support system to express your grief to.

So wholesome. Im not sure if if anyone has pointed this out yet but when Mark asks why all the Swedish women are so hot Josh tells him that its because the Vikings went to other countries and took the most beautiful women they could find. This is exactly what the Harga do in the film through men like Pelle and Ingemare, except instead of pillaging and abduction they lure attractive college age kids full of wanderlust to the commune in order to be used as sacrifices or potential mates. The tripping scenes really fucked with my anxiety and 4 people walked out at the cliff jumping scene. Fantastic movie The camera movement in this is astounding. It adds so much more to disorientation the guests are experiencing. The movement, his camera placement, and the synced cuts enhanced all of the tension he was building. Every subsequent movie Aster puts out is a must see for me. What the fuck did I just watch I have now seen the movie several times (working on its localization) and I have noticed that the folk painting at the beginning (in the first seconds of the movie, right after the A24 logo) actually depicts **the whole plot of the movie!** That shot of Dani starting to dance in the flower dress with the temple burning in the background was damn beautiful. Really not at all what I was expecting. Not much horror elements but the story hooked me and I actually ended up giving a shit about Dani and that ending with her smile was immensely satisfying.

Also, did anyone else notice that seemingly 75% of the time Will Poulter spoke, his back was turned or he was off screen? I think this movie is basically about empathy. It was the first word I thought of when I walked out. No one really understood Dani, and by the end, this entire camp empathized with her. I think my favorite scene is when they are all cry-following her after she sees the ritual. It's kind of beautiful, and kind of weird, and kind of funny, just like the movie. Dani was healing, and it's a fucked up context, but she's finally learning to move on. Main takeaway: a Swedish ritualistic cult can also double as an effective form of group therapy.

EDIT: if you’re an A24 junkie come check out r/A24 and you probably won’t regret it I wish the movie had shown us a bit more of why Connie and Simon were invited. It seemed like Christian, Mark, and Josh were all invited because of clear personality flaws, but the only piece we got about Connie is that she friend zoned Pele’s brother. Maybe I’m reading too much into it?

Regardless, hearing Connie’s screams from the forest and knowing they’re killing her, knowing she and Simon are 100% dead but not seeing the end result until the very end of the movie was a masterful choice. Florence has an unreasonably, impossibly beautiful voice. Also, I think we can all agree that this was the best piece of media this year about a queen named Dani/Dany deciding who gets to burn. Just to give a shout out btw to how utterly infuriating Christian was as a character. Just, spineless from the get go, the scene with her grieving he’s written in the script as ‘looking trapped’, he lands his friends with his girlfriend this meaning EVERYONE involved is tense, totally unsupportive, steals from his friends, etc etc. So well written and so aggravating. Is Ari Aster okay? Does someone want to go check up on him? Dani’s big character turn makes very little sense on paper, but Florence Pugh somehow completely sells it. She is going to be a movie star. That transition from her running to her apartment bathroom, to the scene of her in the airplane restroom was incredible. Sorry for this long response: I drank a lot of coffee before writing this and kind of went overboard.

Here we go.

All the **Flower Symbols** in *Midsommar* (so far):

* The flowered ""i"" in Ari Aster's name during the credits is a flower called an aster
* Maja (the redhead) wore striped carnation flowers in her floral wreath. Carnations usually represent pure love. HOWEVER, *striped* carnations represent a love that cannot be shared (\*cough\* \*cough\*)
* I *think* Dani's wreath was made up of primroses, which represent young love (specifically the sentiment of not being able to live without a partner, which usually comes with young love). To be completely honest, though, her flower was the most difficult to figure out, and I'm still not really sure what it is exactly
* We don't actually see Pelle's wreath until the end, when it is revealed that he was bringing his friends so that they might be ""sacrifices"" to fulfill the ritual. However, he also brought in outsiders in order to expand the gene pool, so to speak, and to prevent everyone from eventually becoming inbred.... his wreath was made of pine branches. Pine tends to represent wisdom, fertility, and longevity...
* Also: Dani gives a bundle of what appears to be Goldenrods to Christian. Goldenrods usually represent encouragement and growth, and are often given to show support for someone after a loss or when they're going through a difficult time (basically given to people to help with depression). My best guess is that this is supposed to be ironic, since he should probably be giving those to her.
* I have yet to figure out which flowers were placed in Simon's eyes in the chicken coup.
* It's also worth noting that Odd (one of the old men; the guy who blows a bunch of shit into Christian's face in the chicken coup) is wearing a unique wreath -- it's mostly made up of some kind of leaf, but I can't figure out what it is.

P.S. I'm not a botanist or florist (in fact I don't really know much about flowers at all), so take all this with a grain of salt. I mostly just noticed the pattern after watching the credits and wanted to do a little bit of research on it (don't steal my thesis, *\*wink\* \*wink\**).

**EDIT**: Sooo after watching it a second time, I don’t know how much of all this *actually* holds up. Most of the flowers I mentioned aren’t as unique to the characters as I previously thought (a lot of them actually have the same flowers too), so I think I overestimated their significance as a whole.... The little bouquet Dani gave to Christian appears to be a whole bunch of different flowers, Pelle’s wreathe is actually made of ferns (not pine), Maya’s flower (striped carnation) is in a whole bunch of other wreaths, etc., etc., etc.... BUT I’m positive about the aster in Ari Aster’s credit at the very least... Anyone want to go watch Austin Powers with the kids? “Christian, wake up. Hey buddy! You can’t move, you can’t speak, we’re gonna burn you alive, sound good? 👌🏽😘” Hey what the fuck ""Oh fuck it's a new person"" while they were all tripping was the most realistic piece of dialogue of this year “Are we not gonna talk about the bear?”

“It’s a bear”

Love how the brushed off what would seem like a primary threat in the movie as nothing and it actually turned out to be not threatening. I haven't seen anyone mention the sound. It was one of the few movies that really made me aware of a stereo effect and I absolutely loved it. 1: Gorgeous movie


2: Amazing movie


3: What the fuck I thought how the movie examined universal morality vs. cultural relativism was really interesting.

On the one hand you had the anthropology students that were of the mindset that cultures shouldn't be judged, even if their gut reaction was revulsion. On the other there was the British couple that said ""nope. we're outta here"". In the moment of watching the movie felt very wtf and kind of let down. But looking at it after the fact- it's so ridiculous how much is going on.

This movie will definitely be harder to sell people on watching compared to Hereditary.


Hereditary had horror/plot elements that were typical horror (murder, ghosts, witchcraft etc). It's heavy on the ""what is fucking happening"" whereas Midsommar  felt like ""why the fuck is this happening"". 


Aster definitely made it easy to see WHAT was going to happen next (the pubic period quilt is the most obvious example). Aside from the elder couple's suicide, the movie was light on gore/seeing death. 

We don't see Connie and Simon die but the audience already knows that. The only surprise is how they repurpose the bodies. A little detail I realized later: When the group is planning their trip, one of them (I think Will Poulter) asks if they are gonna go through Stockholm on their way there, and the Swedish dude says no.

By the end of the film, Dani is clearly going through Stockholm Syndrome, and has fully embraced her captors. Yeahhh.... so that might just be the most unsettling sex scene I’ve ever seen on film.

Also, the scene where Dani runs into the bathroom tripping on shrooms and sees her dead sister for that split second was fucking terrifying. A very solid follow-up by Ari. Oh fuck, a new person. Remember when you were little and watched an R-rated a movie with your parents that unfortunately had an awkward sex scene? I feel so bad for the kid that is going to watch this film with his family. This is probably the most awkward sex scene I have seen. Especially when that older lady gave him a little push. Ha. 

Brilliant film though. I loved it. Trippy as hell. I don't know why everybody on reddit was going ""oh man this script is ten times scarier than *Hereditary*!"" Like I have nothing bad to say about this movie, I loved it, but it wasn't that hard to watch horror-wise. [deleted] I loved how well written Christian’s character was. I was sitting in between two women while seeing the movie, and we all let out audible scoffs during the scene where Dani asks Christian why he didn’t tell her about Sweden and he ends up making her feel insane while he was clearly hiding it from her on purpose. None of his dialogue was incredibly revealing, he didn’t have any long monologues, but we all knew exactly what kinda guy he is- a weak dude who won’t take responsibility for his own life. Guys it isnt a good thing that Dani decided to sacrifice Christian, Dani is trading her hollow unending relationship with Christian for a hollow unending relationship with the Harga. Neither the Harga nor Christian truly care about Dani, the only reason the Harga accept Dani is because that's what their tradition dictates; unbridled acceptance without free will is not genuine affection. The Harga's illusion of caring lures a mentally unstable and trauma filled Dani into their clutches. Dani's journey from start to finish is a circle reflecting the cyclical nature of trauma and relational abuse and not a progression. Wow I just realized what Pelle really meant when he said his parents died in a fire. When the two men that were voluntarily sacrificed were given something to feel no pain... Then the guy is screaming on fire. They just flat out lied to the guys? That scene made my stomach turn. I don't know what's more unbelievable: that an American movie set in Sweden didn't feature Max von Sydow in a small role or that Dani took a nap while tripping on shrooms. Two older ladies walked in with a toddler before the movie started, during the trailers. Everyone in the audience just looked at each other if were all witnessing the same thing.

During the it trailer the mom goes “is this not toy story?” Half the audience goes No no ITS NOT TOY STORY

then at the end when the credits rolled some guy said “I like this iteration of toy story” Man, what a great movie for measuring the sliding scale of idealism vs cynicism. Idealism: Dany gains a new community, of people who share in her expression of grief and pain and welcomed her with open arms instead of sticking by her out of obligation or pity. 

Cynicism: that is LITERALLY how real life cults operate; they prey on the vulnerable, the grieving, the outcast, and offer them a sense of purpose, a goal, a community. They often lavish them with love and acceptance, before completely breaking down their former life and sense of self. 

Also: someone brought a pack of middle schoolers to the showing I saw. When the sex scene started, one of them bolted. Down the dark theater stairs. Backwards. Here’s a theory why the villagers use waving hands throughout the film. Waving hands are commonly used in Deaf community to show a round of applause. If you recall at the dining table with Dani as the May Queen, Christian looked at the old man next to him. The old man clapped in front of him causing Christian to be more distorted as he was under the influence. Sounds does have an effect on one’s senses. I assumed that everyone is under the influence, waving hand is a substitute for applause to avoid disorienting each other. Christian: [goes to hand drug-laced drink back] No thank you. I’m scared I’ll have a bad trip.
Woman: You won’t.

Cut to the scene of Christian stitched inside a dead bear about to be engulfed by giant flames. This movie is like if Wes Anderson went insane. Discount Starlord Both with Hereditary and now Midsommar, Ari Aster does something very unique in horror.  He showcases death without escape.  In many horror movies, the death/violence occurs by a creature, supernatural force, stupidity, etc.  As a result, when the death occurs you direct your anger, frustration, feelings toward the trigger.  You want the creature to be stopped, you want the killer to be caught, you blame the people for being too stupid.  In Hereditary and Midsommar both there are a moments of death where there is no escape.  Hereditary Spoilers Tagged In Case: >!Charlie's death in Hereditary is, before knowledge is provided later, really a series of bad coincidences that lead to an awful tragedy.  There's perhaps some little blame that can be placed here or there and that comes out in the dinner scene, but in the end it's a tragedy.!< The two old members of the community in Midsommar made a choice and we must accept it unflinchingly.  We have to face the horror of that choice and we have no one to blame it on.  It forces us to face the fact that death isn't just this supernatural force.  Everyone must face it, it can happen anywhere, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The drive up to the commune felt very *shining*-esque to me.

Also Im curious, did she pick her boyfriend to he sacrificed or was she still intoxicated? Things in the trailer but not in the movie:

- Dani arguing with Christian at night saying ""I don't wanna acclimate, I wanna go.""

- Dani in a group of Harga at night saying ""What's happening?""

- Camera shot of someone's feet as they begin to levitate off the ground Did anyone else catch where Dani says to Christian “I can see you doing that” (leaving her behind in a car, after the other girl’s boyfriend supposedly left her behind to go to the train station)... and then later on, Dani is the one to leave Christian behind in a “car” when she goes to bless the crops as May Queen?

That part was also a big reversing of roles, he was experiencing everything she’d been through before, he was having a bad trip and trying to deal with being sad and alone, while she only gave minimal support. As an American who went to see it with my Swedish boyfriend, when we left the theater he pointed out that when Pelle meets up with the other guy at the very beginning when they arrive, the man says in Swedish ""Welcome back from your pilgrimage"" indicating that his whole journey to America and going to college was simply to find the right people to bring back for his ""religion"" or ""cult.""

Edit: I wasn't saying this to sound like I'm pointing out the obvious, just thought it was interesting he had that insight so early due to the lack of captioning at the beginning while they spoke Swedish. This movie is like taking a psychedelic. Can’t really describe it, just have to experience it for yourself. But holy, that was brutally fucked in a beautiful way. The reveal of what happened to Dani’s family was almost as gut-wrenching as >!the car scene!< in Hereditary. Dani’s wailing over the phone, followed by the reveal, leading straight into the opening credits.... honestly it was a perfect opening imo I really, really, really loved this movie. That being said:

This is going to be sooooooo divisive. The general public is going to be thrown the hell off. A24 has basically marketed a super fringe art house horror film to the masses. Man..... those fucking tree people with the apples for intestines and branches for arms/coming out the mouth really fucked with me.

&#x200B;

Sidenote: This is how Chidi got into the Bad Place. A tiny detail I liked was when Christian said he and Dani had been together 3.5 years, and she corrected him that it was 4 years.

On the surface, this just looks like Christian being less invested in the relationship. But thematically, it has a different meaning. 6 months is the difference between solstices, and is especially significant in places that experience midnight sun (because the opposite also occurs!)

4 years earlier was summer. Summer is learning and journeying, and ultimately life. To Dani, their relationship is alive and ongoing. Dani ends up alive.

3.5 years earlier was winter. Winter is death. To Christian, their relationship is ending. He wears dark colors when everyone else is wearing white. He ends up dead. I think the movie is suggesting that while the cult makes its violence open and public, it is no more violent than the world outside the cult. In both cases, death is inevitable, and both feature horrific murders and suicides (the sister killing the parents and herself is not that different from the cult's final murder/suicide fire ritual). The difference is that in the world outside the cult, pain is suppressed (Dani excusing herself to the bathroom whenever she feels grief), while in the cult, pain is not only shared (Dani sobbing in unison with the other women after catching Christian cheating) but ritualized. From the cult's perspective, if death and pain are inevitable, better to shine a harsh light on them (literally!) and see them clearly, no matter how gruesome that process might be. And while the outside world fails in guiding both the sister and Dani through their pain, Dani is able to find some peace in the cult by bringing her pain into the light. This is one of my favourite movies.  It frustrates me to read commentary on it, because I feel as if most people don't ""get"" it, and their not ""getting it"" is kinda what the movie is about.

This is not a movie about a failing relationship, or a cult.  This is a movie about surviving trauma, and the profound disconnect that occurs between the people who are surviving it, and the people around them who don't understand what they're going through.

As far as I'm concerned, the only sequence in this film that truly constituted ""horror"" was the opening sequence, where Dani's sister kills herself and her parents.  It is made very clear that Dani is empathetic toward her bipolar sister, and her own studies in psychology suggest a desire to engage with mental health as a whole.

It is made clear, chillingly so, the dynamic between Dani and Christian right off the bat, with Christian telling Dani that her bipolar sister is just ""doing it for attention"" and that Dani encourages her behaviour.  This same lack of understanding about mental health struggles would define Christian's behaviour for the rest of the film.

I've read here and elsewhere the theory that Christian is a ""bad boyfriend"".  It's missing the point.  He's not a bad boyfriend.  He occupies the same space that so many people occupy when they are in relationships with, or adjacent to, people recovering from trauma or other mental health issues.  He is profoundly uncomfortable, he is split between ""wanting to help his partner"" and also ""feeling overstretched"".

Pelle was so encouraging of Dani to come to the festival because Pelle knew, explicitly, that the cult was going to be able to provide Dani with better tools to recover from her trauma.  It's made so clear, the way the women in the cult scream along with Dani when she's sad, laugh along with her when she's happy.  The cult is with her, emotionally, willing to feel all the same awful feelings Dani is feeling.

Dani's eventual decision to have Christian burned was not punishment, it was not revenge.  It was survival.  The trauma of losing her sister and parents was destroying her life.  The cult had shown her communal support and release from that trauma.  Sacrificing Christian was the final step she needed to take to sever ties with her previous, traumatized state.

There are multiple scenes in the movie where Dani cries, or is on the verge of tears.  She cries on the phone in the face of Christian's indifference.  She has to break off her conversation with Pelle to cry in the bathroom.  She cries in the airplane.  She steps away from the group upon arriving at Halsingland to cry.  Trauma defines this woman's life, and would destroy her if she didn't find a way to escape from it.

The scene after Dani discovers Christian having sex with the cult member, and the women of the cult hold Dani, and scream along with her, I watched it and said to myself, ""this is actually what trauma survivors need.  Not for people to check in on them, not for people to try and distract them.  Trauma survivors need people to be so present for them with their pain, to experience the pain along with them, to encourage them to scream through it, to encourage them to express it.""

As far as I'm concerned, this movie is second only to Akerman's Jeanne Dielman in its successful depiction of trauma recovery. I loved the parallel of Dani sobbing while her bf quietly held her, as opposed to her sobbing and wailing while her new family feels the pain with her and wail and sob right along with her. Beautiful poetry. I feel like I’m supposed to like this movie. It’s shot incredibly well, Florence Pugh put on a hell of a performance and the jumps from grief/humor/horror were more or less seamless. Something about it just didn’t fully click for me like Hereditary did. Anybody else notice that the girl who lured mark away showed up in the end with a giant scratch on her face? What a cool detail haha I’ve yet to see anyone comment on the genius use of mirrors, windows and reflective surfaces as perspective throughout the movie. At first it was focused mainly on Dani and Christian and how out of sync they are and operating on different planes, but then there was the library “window” and reflective table covering at the commune. Did anyone else pick up on the theme of breathing/oxygen throughout the film? Examples:

&#x200B;

\-Dani's sister uses carbon monoxide to kill herself and her parents.  This is literally suffocating someone by stopping your body from using oxygen. 

&#x200B;

\-Dani has episodes where she can't breathe/catch her breath which causes panic attacks (or vice/versa?)

&#x200B;

\-When Christian and Dani are together, they take the oxygen away from each other as evidenced by Christian trying to light the birthday candle on the cake but it won't stay lit

&#x200B;

\-Dani finally has her catharsis when the women are down on the ground with her breathing with her

&#x200B;

\-During the finale the sacrificial building burns easily, signaling that Dani is able to breathe I'm not sure if Pelle's fondness for Dani was genuine or not and in all honesty that was the most unsettling part of the film to me.

Him straight-up mackin on Dani when she was crowned Mayqueen and his sketches of her make me think it was, but that doesn't make the indoctrination any better. Just got out a full theater and the usher asked me what I thought. I said it was good. I was the last person out of the theater and the second person to say I liked it. The audience score will not be kind. [deleted] There were like three 11/12 year olds in my theater which made the whole experience so much more uncomfortable. That shot of Dani walking in the full floral garb in front of the burning temple was such stellar cinematography. Overall, I just loved the juxtaposition of hypnotic beautiful visuals and other shots that just make you want to look away in disgust. The fact that Josh didn't warn her that she was about to witness a suicide after she just lost her entire family to suicide is heinous. I was so okay with all of those guys dying.

Such a good film. The fact that I was rooting for the ""evil"" cult to kill everyone by the end took some good writing. I actually LIKED the guy that lured them there by the end. Man I fucking loved that. Looking back on the whole thing, you can see how so much of what the cult does feeds into it being a truly empathetic family. Their pained reactions to the guy that doesn’t die after jumping off the cliff, their crying in sync with Dani, even down to their fucking moans of pleasure and stroking themselves as one of them has sex. The whole thing inevitably leading to Dani finally finding self-respect among people who respect her and *truly* empathize with her feelings, as opposed to Christian who only pretends to care.

Certainly not as scary as Hereditary, as that felt like a true onslaught of horrific imagery, outside of Josh and Matt’s deaths. But overall, a much tighter narrative with so much compelling and well-placed symbolism for what a support network and what relationship *should* look like.

8/10

EDIT: Also, thinking about it more, I think that Dani (and previous may queens) won the dance competition because it requires an element of being in tune with the people around you and their movements. Dani, a very sensitive and caring person, was naturally more aware of the people around her, and in a sense, her being crowned the winner is also crowning her as the most empathetic person, which is the actual goal of the whole dance competition. Going in, I discussed with a friend how it’s hard to pull off horror in sunlight. When they put psychedelics in the picture, I think that gave it the sense of danger and the unknown that night would. Maybe even worse because at that point you can’t fully trust even what you look at right in front of you

Great movie, I felt for Dani’s grief so much and though it’s kinda fucked up, I was kinda happy to see her get some form of uh, support emotionally in the end Pelle tells Dani that his parents died in a fire when he was young. Does that correlate to the ending of the movie or am I just overthinking it? This whole movie was a trip This is the most elaborate break-up in history

EDIT: for my fellow A24 fans... come check out r/A24!  We’ve got a marathon going through each release, giveaways, discussions, etc. and would love to get some “new bloods” [deleted] I don’t have anything to say about the movie, just that in the final sacrifice scene our theaters lights came on and they started playing the Maria Menounos audio This is a movie that might rub some people the wrong way, but I loved it. It was bizarre, unsettling, tense, and absolutely beautifully shot. Not for the faint of heart, but it’s quite a ride I have never related more to someone than when Christian asked that guy what was happening and then the dude clapped in his face. A lot of the times I felt that the cultists greeted Dani much more warmly and openly compared to the others. Good catch... that is some foreshadowing right there. I was under the impression that this ceremony only happened every 90 years. But I guess that wouldn't add up either since they had pics of the previous Queen. Oh good catch about his parents and the fire they died in. I want to agree, but it seems like they would thin out their numbers way too fast if they killed four of their own each year. 110%.  People are saying this is a movie about heaing, its a movie about rebirth.  Seasons are a major theme in rebirth esque stories.  The boyfriend being sewn up in the bear I think was supposed to be representative of a pregnancy, when he burns, the 'birth' of the Dani's new life starts. [deleted] To see the two plot lines connect like that was a heart-wrenching and disturbing way to start it all. I just remember looking and thinking, “aww man, the parents OD’d and the sister suffocated herself.” Then the firefighters started following the hoses... I can tell you I was not ready to see that finish with her sister dying by the laptop with an exhaust strapped to her mouth... that was some fucked up shit. I also found the reveal of her family's death to be the most dark moment of the movie. I was like fuck, her boyfriend already doesn't want to be with her and is gaslighting her into thinking that she's overreacting and now her family's gone.

There were some fucked up things throughout the rest of the film but I thouht Dani's family's death was the darkest. The intro absolutely fucked with me. Ari Aster has a knack for using really gut-wrenching, grounded, real-world terrors as a hook for the more strange or supernatural horror after. The music during that scene was awesome, loved how they mixed in the sirens into the actual score I agree. Sound was great. And how they mixed the sound into hard cuts made even innocuous scenes feel startling. I agree! I always felt so uncomfortable with the absolute silence before they ate and then when it was only the sound of utensils being used I specifically remember jumping in my seat because someone started yelling over the aisle next to me. It was just Poulter’s character yelling something offscreen. I love the Mural they show at the start of the movie that outlines the entire plot but, at the time, you just don't know what you're looking at. The painting of the little girl petting the bear above her bed comes to mind Ahhhhh Yeah, the line in the script and trailer did not use the word ""impregnate.""  Hearing that in the actual movie made me go, ""Whoaaaa there Pelle."" I thought that was Mark? Wil Poulters character. I remembered that line and thought all the other naked women were going to jump him after he impregnated the virgin. OMFG [deleted] Especially because that happened more than once, for instance towards the end when Dani is the first to pick up utensils. The effect was pretty impressive. It’s ok, just drink some period water and eat some pube pie and get a new wife. I took my mom to this film. Make her watch Holy Mountain Worth it nonetheless. One interesting thing: In the screenplay, the Austin Powers joke was not there. Instead, there was a scene where the whole village watched a movie together. The movie they watched was a visualization of the 'love potion' story. 

I guess at some point they took out the movie watching scene and instead just conveyed the 'love portion' story through the quilts that were hanging.

I think it was probably a good way to speeding things up. The campy movie that the whole village watches on a projector probably would've added to the bizarre atmosphere a bit more though. [PG version of that sex scene](https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2018/06/28/1030938-austin-powers-international-man-of-mystery-1997.jpg?x=747&y=800&icq=74&sig=34afd3982f842bd6c85796b0663d0cb8) One thing I may have noticed: The girl who Mark was into is introduced and mentions Austin Powers (who is played by Mike Myers). She later leads him away and he's never seen alive again. The next time we ""see"" him, his face is being worn by someone and it really resembles Michael Myers (from Halloween). This might be a bit of a stretch, but I thought I'd point it out in case anyone else got that. “As long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I’ll be sound as a pound!” I think they mention it to remind us the villagers are regular people. Sure they have weird cult traditions during midsommar but during the rest of the year they regular people like you and me. They wear normal clothes, go to college, and hell probably work at the water power plant too. They watch movies like all of us Ooo, I agree, especially since ABBA is swedish Killer Queen too on the nose? She had me in her first scene leaving a voicemail to her parents, I knew immediately then she was going to be great. The way she played both the gaslit, overly-apologetic and anxious girlfriend and the confident happy May Queen was impressive. Seconded, the way everything was kind of wavy was spot on but the flowers opening and closing gave me anxiety. Sorry about commenting on an old post but the scene where she took the mushrooms and was reminded about her family and immediately walks away, hyperventilates, and is repeating to herself ""don't think about that, don't think about that"" is honestly more anxiety inducing than anything else I've ever watched, reminded me of my few ""bad trips"" Ari Aster came out in a video and said that Midsommar was a ""horror movie about codependency"" which I think he more than succeeded in. 

The relationship between Dani and Christian was painful to watch because of that codependency, and even the small hints towards Dani's sister showed it ran in the family the desire to lean on someone else. In the end, Dani got something she **did** really want; a extremely empathetic family! (To replace the one she lost of course)

 During the film, I noticed how there were so many scenes that involved reflections, mirrors, etc. I didn't understand it at first, I thought maybe it represented the different perspectives of the couple and how they see things, looking into the other but having something in the way. An obstacle. But I love the idea that mirroring represents empathizing and comfort, that makes a lot of sense with different scenes and other reoccurring things in the film. I'm really glad you pointed that out because I was really curious as to what the mirrors/reflections meant! Also the mirrors can show separation. When Chris and Danni come back from the party, Chris is shot in a mirror showing the wall that has come up between them.

Then, when he tells his friends that Danni is coming with him, he moves from being with them to being shot in a mirror, showing that it has driven a wedge between him and the others. I’m not sure I can remember every instance, but during the movie I thought everyone depicted in a mirror was being dishonest

- Chris at the start says he wasn’t sure he was really going away

- Chris speaking to his friends about inviting Dani (Saying he’s unsure she’ll really go, oh by the way I sort of told her this and that)

- Dani seeing her sister in the mirror, but she’s tripping and its not really there.

- When Josh sees Mark in the reflection when taking photos of the book, but its not really him.

Feel free to poke holes lol, just something I thought of while I was watching Can you imagine being in that kind of relationship and you both coming to see this movie? great acting and writing, lots of long long takes too It was amazing how little it took to really illustrate how toxic he was I also like how during that argument scene, Dani begs Christian to come sit beside her on the couch and talk with her, which he refuses. Later after the senicide/cliff jumping, Dani is freaking out and Pelle comes and sits right beside her and comforts her. Just another way to show that Christian was never going to be the one to fold, and that Dani’s relationship with him was desperately dependent. She wanted someone to go through it with her, and it wouldn’t be Christian. Yup and also how Ari directed it, with them physically swapping sides when she goes on the apologetic route. He’s an absolute master! ""There will be no pain""

Narrator: There was Ingmar is given the drug to ""have no fear"" 
The other guy is told hell ""have no pain"" 

Ingmar looks pretty scared, and the other fella looks like it hurts. The stumble-out-of-barn-and-into-floral-flaying-shed of shame Did anyone notice he had blood on his penis? I'm assuming she is a virgin. I mean, that felt very much like a rape scene, despite my theaters reaction to it. Boy was definitely coerced by all the drugs. Did it annoy anyone else that he ran past the truck and into the shed? Like get the hell into the truck and drive away. I turned to my girlfriend and said ""great transition"" at that point. It was seamless! And I know all about seamlessness. My wife and I were talking about this in the car. What the fuck does Ari tell them to get that reaction? The deaths and grief in his movie are a complete next level of upsetting. I think the way he writes these crying scenes in his scripts, really helps the actors visualize the type of intensity he wants portrayed. Plus of course, casting the right person w/ the chops to pull it off. 


> CHRISTIAN
Hello?

On the other end: an extended, agonized MOAN.

Dani?

DANI (V.O.) (distantly)...no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

CHRISTIAN 
Sweetheart? What’s going on?

But now there’s only heavy, frightening CRYING on the other end. It’s a deep, horrible cry. One of pure animal grief.

CHRISTIAN (CONT’D) (now scared)What’s happening, baby? Please talk to me.

The crying has curdled into a sustained WAIL OF ANGUISH.

-----

INT. DANI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 12
Wide on the LIVING ROOM. We’re centered on the COUCH, where Christian sits. Dani has crumbled there, her head shaking violently against Christian’s lap as she WEEPS. Behind them: a WINDOW showcases snowfall against the dark night.

Dani’s sobs are possessed of a profound despair. It’s so intense that it looks painful - dangerous even. Absolutely. People also lost it when the old lady was pushing the bf’s ass Yup. That whole scene was absolutely fucked. Amazing part for us though was that once Dani came and the other weird part happened with the crying, no one laughed, we only sympathized. My theater started laughing at that scene! Agreed. And she wasn’t really able to heal appropriately because she lost everything. This cult provided her the support. This was her journey to heal.


Edit: Someone asked me to clarify this in another comment: 
Edit2: clarified some points after my second viewing. 

From a story perspective, it was a slow burn. I viewed one angle of this film as Dani’s struggle to cope and heal with her tragedy. She lost everything (her family). A common re-occurring theme was isolation:

1. traveling to a foreign country
2. the other friends did not want Dani on the trip
3. the other couple’s fiancé ”going to the train station” leaving the other girl alone
4. Many of the main characters are in PhD programs. For anyone who has done this, it is an incredibly isolating process
5. Even the two guys were fighting over their thesis topics. One was struggling to share (he died). The other willing to share and collaborate (he survived a bit longer). 

The film explored how isolation leaves individuals very vulnerable. 

6. when all of the American characters were alone they got chopped off one-by-one,

7. This isolation was also demonstrated by her sister struggling with bipolar disorder in the opening. And even wanting to take the parents with her (in the suicide). 

8. Even Dani is shown in the beginning taking Ativan (Lorazepam), which is an antidepressant /anxiety medication. Depression and anxiety are very isolating themselves. She struggles and just wants to talk to her boyfriend (about Sweden, her tragic loss by calling etc).

9. Even many of the characters share drugs, and the film takes time to highlight this (mushrooms, sleeping pills, etc.) 

This cult acted as a way for her to heal by providing family/friends and eliminated her isolation (demonstrated when they mimicked her crying, the screaming at the end, etc). I’m glad someone else thinks so! I thought that scene was so beautiful and moving and completely non-creepy. Obviously it’s weird and people in our culture don’t really act like that, but what else is love besides sitting there and willingly stepping into feeling someone else’s pain in such a visceral and raw way? Dani even tries to run away from them and isolate, but they pull her back and force her to express her emotions and they mirror them right back, saying “we will feel this with you.” So cool, and a moment that resonated with me within a lot of hilarious weirdness in this movie lol Hereditary is easier to swallow and easier (for me) to recommend to others whereas Midsommar for me was... strange. I don’t know. I feel weird about it. Like I loved it but at the same time like it shouldn’t exist? Like it’s not something I should’ve seen. Ari Aster truly knows how to fuck people up. I pretty much just sat stunned in silence as the credits for Midsommar rolled. No idea what to say or think. Just silent. Bro idk what I saw I noticed things breathing often but not that. Yes! And as soon as my brain registered it, the movie cut away. The LSD-like trippy visuals are comparable to the >!naked cultists!< in Hereditary, in the background and probably appreciated more upon second viewing. I was w the cult and could even understand the 72 year old death thing but then they started torturing people and I just couldn’t get behind it. The lungs guy, for one, and then burning alive. Really took them from still pleasant, just different—to totally sinister, imo. I don’t know if we were supposed to come to their side, but I didn’t. I think it was there to help maintain the disorientation of the characters. Weird sun cycles on top of restless sleep to contribute to their restlessness and uneasiness.

Just my thoughts tho Also did anyone else notice that someone put scissors(?) under the baby's pillow when it was crying? Trying to remember if there were any other references throughout the film to explain this Not sure if this is why, but it made me think of kibbutzes in the early days where children would sleep separately from their parents like in this Swedish cult. It turned out that it’s hugely harmful to kids development and is now looked at as a terrible practice. The baby not being comforted shows how fucked up their lifestyle is. Yeah the multitude of photographs in the sleeping barn pretty much confirm this [deleted] Really late on this comment, but my interpretation was a lot of the noise mimicking was done just to drown out the original noise. When the guy breaks his legs for example, if everyone just sat around listening to the guy screaming in pain people might start to see the ritual as horrifying and be dissuaded from making the jump themselves when it's their turn, and it would just in general bring down the whole celebratory vibe the village was trying to go for with it, so they make part of the ritual involve everyone making pained screams themselves so that nobody can hear the cries injured guy might be making (and if they do it would be indistinguishable from all the others). And the same goes for the fire at the end, nobody wants to hear their friends/relatives scream as they're burning alive so as part of the custom they all just scream too, to drown it out and keep the ritual's mood lighter and more game-y. It's using the fact that the Swedish for midsummer is ""midsommar"" (because it's a loanword in English with the spelling altered over time due to lingual shift) as a device. It doesn't really work because not all the altered words derive from old Norse. Seriously, I was so pleasantly surprised that it was actually *hilarious*. I audibly laughed multiple times. So hilarious (especially Poulter) while still being equally bonkers and just flat out creepy as hell. I was trying to think of literally any movie that coupled horror with comedy that wasn’t campy and I couldn’t think of a single one. It’s quite the feat honestly. “Hey do they know they’re walking stupid?” See to me it's all about the ways that we deal with grief. You have the person who laughs, the person who gets technical and information heavy, the person who is apprehensive, the person who uses activities to distract, and the person who just outright ignores it. This movie to me puts forth the notion that the only true way to get over grief is with a community that understands you and to confront it outright instead of pretending you are strong. It's only when we let our guards down with getting rid of the other methods and embrace the situation with people is when we are truly happy. >Is it a about grief? Cheating? The lack of empathy we give others when they need it most? 

Yes That Danni/Christian scene in the beginning is a perfect capsulation of pre-breakup terrible relationships. 


DANI *“I don't need an apology. I just wanna talk about it.”*


CHRISTIAN *“I think I should probably go home.”*


DANI *“I'm not trying to attack you.”*


CHRISTIAN *“Well, it feels like that.”*


DANI *“Well...I’m sorry! I am sorry. I just got confused.”* He was going through something, that's for sure [deleted] I agree. I'd probably understand it better if I saw it again but it was just way too long I want to see it again to find things but it is not always the easiest watch. Blood eagle I think that was the drugs- at the feast the meat on the platters on the table looked like they were “breathing” too- just my take It's really unlikely he was still alive, if not from bloodloss then from the sheer amount of trauma done to him (his entire back open and spine out) even with a sterile environment and cutting edge technology you would not be able to pull out someones lungs and spine and expect them to live, let alone have any semblance of consciousness. I think we can agree that a barn filled with chickens (I think they were even roosting in his carcass?) is not a sterile environment and it's unlikely they used anything close to precise surgical equipment.

I just assumed it was a trick of the eyes or drug hallucination. I laughed pretty hard when Mark took a hit from his vape for the first time. [deleted] “Skin the fool” Early in the film where they’re all in one of the guys’ apartment I noticed a picture of the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz on top of the fridge and thought “huh that’s weird,” and when they rolled out Mark’s (?) skin stuffed with straw I put two and two together. Christian inside of the bear carcass kind of looks like the Cowardly Lion, and now I’m just trying to figure out how Josh connects to the Tin Man! Maybe because he was frozen/paralyzed after getting hit with the mallet? don't forget naked people of all types doing weird ritual shit And stating movies with family tragedies. I’m trying to tell my friend about it now, and the only thing I can come up with is that “it’s a festival that really goes fucking sideways.” “White people BBQ”. But for real, it was refreshing to see a western, European culture portrayed as an exotic “other”. Especially when the only black dude was actually the most clued-in outsider since he was a scholar on the topic. Him saying “I don’t want any new people right now” was 100% relatable He made the movie for me! He’s great at acting like someone tripping. His acid trip in Bandersnatch was hilarious too. This movie has the most accurate representation of taking a hallucinogen I've ever seen. it was so frickin accurate Not as exhausted as the sister and parents I'll bet. Nine human lives. I love the post-sex smile. It's like she thought that the push made the difference. I kind of thought her job was to make sure he didnt pull out. Which would have been hilarious for him to do. That's definitely what I took from her character. Choosing Christian to die at the end seemed like her final decision to fully leave behind her old life/family and friend dynamic. I gotta be honest- I was not expecting a female on male rape scene in this movie but here we are. BF's last words were ""What is happening?"" which is also a pretty accurate summary I hadn’t even considered this. Very interesting comparisons to be drawn here. This is also coupled with the fact Ari Aster described it as [“a Wizard of Oz for perverts”](http://collider.com/midsommar-ari-aster-description-wizard-of-oz-for-perverts/) . [deleted] I thought the hose going through the home was a reference to the yellow brick road. Not to mention how the opening scenes are dark and monochromatic and the colour palette turns Technicolor bright when they arrive to the village. The love story we saw eventually came true! I completely missed that! Dammit! 

So everyone else’s drink was yellow? And Christians was orange because it was mixed with the girls period blood? I caught that immediately, the three women who were sitting next to me did not. Not until the pube and a closer shot of his drink. It clicked all at once for them. Cue quieted gagging. seriously. was this his first Attestupa? gotta end it with the first dive. Can you blame him? He was clearly hammered Anybody else think that it was his direct relatives who had to bash his head in to finish him off? That part just baffled me. Like... did he *want* to survive the fall to give his friends the chance to Gallagher his ass with the hammer? There definitely was. I remember a woman in a brown tank top.

Edit: My girlfriend pointed out that Pele said it was other young members returning when they first pulled up. It was probably the younger members returning. It took a few scenes for Pelle to change from his outside clothes into the white family garb. Tons of foreshadowing ... another time Pelle says him and his ""sister"" were born the same day... foreshadowing the people jumping off the cliff when they both turn 72. The cliff jumping scene was horrifying. The shot where the camera was upside-down on the drive through the forest was incredible. Whenever you figure it out, please tell me. >incoherent Swedish singing 

Ari, probably 9 Reasons Not to Go to Grad School [deleted] Were there two endings? I swear mine ended with her stunned and just smiled at the end. I don’t recall her dancing while everyone was grieving Was she dancing?  I thought she was trying to walk through the path of sticks while carrying that big dress Definitely felt like a lot of ADR for his character. I think that Ari was just trying to show the majority of it from Dani’s perspective. I noticed that she was mainly in the center of the screen throughout, especially when others were talking. So it’s like we got to hear the characters how she did. I was genuinely happy when she was doing the May pole and was breaking into smile every so often. She has such an expressive face. I really liked the difference between her boyfriend awkwardly comforting her on the couch and when Pelle was comforting her 

She said she just wanted to sit down and talk with her boyfriend and he just wouldn’t do it, but her nice Swedish buddy did just that- just talked with her

And the imagery of the group scooping her up as she was falling down and whisking her away to take care of her

Man I fucking loved this movie Pelle's brother/friend (can't remember his name) was interested in Connie. He even claimed to have dated her, which she immediately rebuffed. It seemed like Pelle and his brother/friend both invited girls they were interested in mating with as well as their men who could be outsiders and potential mates for the cult women as well as sacrifices. But because there can only be one May Queen, it was kind of a gamble which girl would be the new member and which one would be the sacrifice. I’m so dumb I didn’t even realize that was her screaming. In the screenplay, there are more incidents where Connie and Simon are being “disrespectful” to the cult. Ari noted that they were all eating meat throughout the festival, but at one point the cult members sacrifice some animals in front of everyone, including a dog. This causes Simon to get super angry and argue with a few of them, but they point out to him that he’s being a hypocrite if he doesn’t have a problem eating animals but he doesn’t feel comfortable watching them die. That’s when they decide to leave. So I have a theory on this-

I think Connie was initially destined to be the May Queen. It's pretty obvious that the cult had set it up for Dani to become the May Queen, but she was initially not supposed to be coming along on the trip.

Pelle's brother brought Connie and Simon, and had Connie not come we would have seen the story play out with Simon and Connie in the lead roles. Perhaps Pelle would have instead been the last sacrifice as well. That's why Pelle was so happy when he found out about Dani, because he found the perfect candidate for a May Queen. If we had delved more into their backstory, I think we would have learned of some past trauma/loss from Connie that would have made sense for her being receptive to the cult and Midsommar celebration. Oh yeah I loved when she sang the duet while “blessing” their crops. Her voice was like a full octave lower than the other singer. Not sure what to make of that from the plot standpoint but it sounded really cool. Damn. Even on here you can’t escape the hell that was the GoT final season... but this is a great way to mention it. Have an upvote. I felt for him at the beginning, because yeah he’s faaar from the real victim but damn that’s a shitty spot to be in; you’re heavily considering leaving your girlfriend and then her *entire fuckin family dies*? In that situation all you can do is stay with her and do your best to provide sympathy, as awful as it would honestly probably be.

However he just went on to be the world’s biggest douche for the rest of the film so I felt considerably less bad for him

edit: like if your girlfriend experiences one of the most traumatic things possible *you remember her birthday*

*and get her a good present jesus fuck christian* Fella has some demons, fa sho. It makes total sense. The commune's ability to share their emotions makes her feel at home. She did not have that with her sister, parents, or Christian and his friends, except Pelle by the end. Basically the Swedish friend's offer for the support and comfor the village could offer was sincere and she bought in. I read this in Korg’s voice “Everybody lay down. Can you please lay down josh” I loved the Swedish friend during that scene. “No Mark, new people are good.” Seems like a fun guy to do drugs with (up until he sacrifices me for his commune) New person: ""Hej!""

Everyone else: I liked the fakeout of the scissors under the baby’s pillow too. At least when I saw that, I kept kind of worrying that something fucked was gonna happen to the baby, but nope. I kind feel like Aster did that on purpose. The ending music buildup to the fire burning was great. Reminded me of the horn entrance to hell treehouse scene in Hereditary.


Edit: they finally uploaded it on YouTube
https://youtu.be/fd014sIrTgM I just want to know why the incest prophet child was painting on a cloud at the end. If I get that much I'll be able to cope And them of course the anthropology students are actually shown to be self centered, invasive cunts. > I thought how the movie examined universal morality vs. cultural relativism was really interesting.

They got Chidi for a reason. Were people laughing during that scene in your audience? I was genuinely disturbed and people were laughing all around me. Can everyone lie down with me, please? I took my grandmother of all people with me to go see it since she kept telling me how much she liked the trailer. I peeked over at her during the scene and it wasn’t pretty. If you don't dip out after the skull smashing, then awkward Granny butt grip sex is as fair game as anything. [deleted] The part where he gave up his friend because of the book and said; ""We don't associate with him at all, we aren't his friends and we don't collaborate with him."" That really cemented my feelings for Christian and the fact that I didn't care what happened to him at all. He was such a jerk the whole film, even if he had good intentions in the beginning for staying with Dani as she processed what happened. Plus once she turns 72 her ass is gonna her yeeted the fuck off a giant cliff Yeah she’s quite literally drinking the Kool Aid, I think Velle picked her because he knew she’d be malleable, he saw her crack up at the word family before they even left And what he really meant when he implied people in the commune who are 72+ die. I think based the Yew was based on symbolism.  Symbolism was part of the tribe.  Also the community actively takes part in their pain, which leads me to believe that this was a known factor for this ritual. I don't think they believed they were lying to them. They were just fanatics with unshakable faith in their traditions and probably genuinely believed that the properties of that substance made them immune to pain (and when they hear the screams they probably justify it in their heads with something like all fanatics do). I think the most unbelievable part of the shroom trip was that nobody was like, “hey you recently lost your entire family to a murder suicide. now might not be an ideal time to trip shrooms” There were a few eleven year olds with their parents in my showing and that was bad enough, but a toddler.. lol that would be bad Oh. Oh that poor, sweet midsommar child Yup the leader at the end commends pelle’s “ingenuity” for basically orchestrating everything kind of reminded me how Kubrick trick millions of people to watch eyes wide shut for a box office of $162 million It’s similar to mother! in that situation I think it was genuine. At least that’s how I took, and that is part of why the movie hit me like it did. These people were so damn, earnest, sincere and committed to their rituals and way of life, even if they lied to others. The flowers were so pretty throughout the movie, but by that scene she was so overwhelmed by them that she looked like a grotesque floral slug I thought it was a setup from the very beginning? They wanted Dani to be the new Queen and the women took turns slowly bowing out/flopping until she was the last one standing. Ehhhh I might be good on joining communities for a bit.. [deleted] They liked her cause she fit their look without being actually related to them. She will probably mate with Pele and start a new branch in their fucked up family tree Yeah he says yadda yadda every 90 nears then in the same scene shows Dani ""last year's"" May Queen. WHAT IS IT PELE But if it happens every 90 years does that mean Pelle is very old? Didn’t they say they’re reborn though? From what they said it sounded like 4 die and 4 are born from the ritual (even though we only see 1 of their own have sex). I think one could make the argument that healing from grief is much of a rebirth. “This is the first day of the rest of my life.” Type of thing. I don’t get nightmares but seeing that hose ductaped to her mouth is nightmare fuel. the color differences between the first section and the rest of the movie are interesting The worst part was you could see her parents breathing the first time we see her call. Had she went with her instincts instead of Christians she may have saved them. It's in the mural in the beginning as well foreshadowing what's to come. [Here it is, if you wanted to see it more.](https://i.redd.it/hkrlj4ej2i831.jpg) Also the artwork banner that Connie and Simon walk past, that shows the pube-pie, the virgin sex ceremony, and the impregnation. “She kissed the bear on the nose” John Bauer There it is I read the script. Pelle said impregnate Mark said right before it ""You could be getting that waitress pregnant **right now** "" Which leads into Pelle's line Lmao me too. My buddy whispered to me ""death by snu-snu"" and i fuckin died laughing That was another one that stood out to me as well! Those two shots must have taken so long to do so correctly. I remember getting a little dizzy with the may pole shot, with the fluid motion of Dani as she locks arms and continues down the line before revolving back around. Amazing cinematography, Ari Aster has secured my ticket to whatever movie he makes next. Don't forget to sacrifice the old one Wait, period water? Was that why it zoomed in on Christian drinking that reddish liquid? I had no idea what it was. My girlfriend decided to take her mom with us for this one. No idea why, she watched Hereditary with me and knows what Ari is all about. Needless to say her mom did not enjoy this one, she left after the cliff scene. Hail Paimon for that, did not want to have a conversation with her about the ending. The biggest problem with cutting the screening was Christian's makeshift birthday cake comes immediately after Pelle telling him that he fucked up instead of him bringing the slice to Dani after they watched the film. Yeah, I liked that the outdoor movie in the script makes the reader think, ""Oh, wow.  They watch movies.  ...Oh, they make their own movies?  I wonder how that goes.  Interesting.""  And then the script goes into this really unusual, unsettling short film, and you know the whole community is eating it up, while the outsiders are thinking what the actual fuck.  I also like that the outdoor movie is one of the first really weird things about the community that the outsiders learn, and it plants a seed of ""are these people for real about these things, or is it just made-up storytelling?"" ""We said Michael Myers, *Halloween* masks!""

""This is a Mike Myers Halloween mask!"" That face was a stretch indeed IMO, I think it was more a reference to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That whole scene was pretty identical to the way letherface was introduced. The hammer, the actual human face as a mask, the twitching, dragging the body away. Oh my god. As a millennial who has taken acid at festivals, I’ve seen flower crowns do that. It does bug you out.

Kind of a cringe comment, I know. Absolutely! I ended up deeply identifying with Dani which led to a fairly optimistic interpretation of the ending, though I understand why people could see it as sinister. Listened to an interview with Ari Aster and they talked about this exact situation lol. The interviewer said it's a great date movie for people in a strong relationship and a horrible one for people in a rocky relationship. A buddy of mine is taking a date to it. I was like ""UHHHHHHHHH"" Right? It’s impressive writing to make something like that believable and easily understandable in just a couple minutes of screen time that might of been in the top disturbing parts of the film for me.  and this one had alllllllot This was a huge scene. I think it showed that the cult was, ultimately, godless. They were given the same thing. The phrasing was just different. Oh, that old tired movie trope. He wasn't flayed.  He was made into a blood eagle.  A viking torture method Broke the hymen my friend Yeah that was because Maja had just gotten “permission” to have sex. She was a virgin. Yes she menstruated into his drink too that’s why it was orange when everyone else’s was yellow it’s all on the tapestry when the mom started humming and holding hands my whole theatre burst out in laughter 1) as if the keys would be in it

2) hard to process information when you're tripping out of your gourd I know, it’s basically unprecedented as far as I can recall. I’d never seen a more realistic depiction of complete hopeless grief before Hereditary. It was borderline animalistic. I lost my mom when I was 15 and had that same reaction. It was almost soothing(?) to see that portrayed realistically onscreen. 

I don’t know, it’s a weird paradigm, grieving. There were so many random parts of Hereditary and Midsommar that made certain sections of my brain tingle. I would really like to know why those areas lit up to certain stimuli. I will say the final shot of the movie made the entire back of my brain completely light up, and give me shivers. That shot of all the Swedes completely losing their shit while the yellow sacrificial building burned with that FUCKING AMAZING score just hit me in the most perfect way. When Dani stumbled into the scene and showed that she was fully assimilated just put that perfect cherry on top. I had to pick my sister up after she was told her long term boyfriend had died by suicide a few years ago. Those are cries and noises I never, ever, ever care to hear again, and sounds I hope no one else ever has to hear out of the ones they love. They're fucking gut wrenching and still haunt me almost 3 years later. 

Colette and Pugh absolutely nailed the sorrow and the wails, they both made me actually feel ill. Her grief at seeing Christian in the orgy and the subsequent group therapy/crying was reminiscent of a woman going through natural childbirth with a bunch of midwives. 

Florence Pugh's acting was some next level shit, it was truly incredible. She played this character so masterfully, with her evolution through trauma and insecurity into this almost fatalistic acceptance of her new role. She was incredibly sympathetic, up until the moment of her face turn heel. 

I really hope Ari becomes one of those directors that has a small group of actors he keeps using in his films because I'd llove to see this team up again. The scene where her wailing sort of merged with the discordant music behind her was horrific Bravo to Pugh. I actually got really emotional because of her sobs. In my theater to people lost it at both scenes, staring in the eyes when she started singing and pushing on the ass. There was a lot of laughs but only at stuff that was meant to be funny, mostly Will Poulter's dialogue. I mean who's gonna see this on a Tuessday night unless they're a Hereditary fan, so I'm guessing most of the crowd knew what to expect. Also when she has the nightmare of them all leaving in the middle of the night. One thing I'm debating: when all the women share in her grief and her pain, screaming into her face, it's definitely liberating, but there is something also very odd and disorienting about it, like the way people attempt to shoulder your grief via some false estimation of it. It can be genuine but also a bit smothering at the same time, making it hard to fully feel catharsis in that moment.

Do you think that tension was intentional, or is the moment supposed to something purely hopeful and cathartic for her? Exactly! And she wasn’t surrounded by anyone else who genuinely cared about her. The boyfriend stayed with her out of obligation, and while sentencing him to death was a little harsh, I can definitely see the symbolic gesture of the ending. Best review so far There was a distinct face in the background after Dani was crowned May queen, I believe while walking to the feast and her flower crown / other parts of the background were tripping. If there were more, I missed them. >The LSD-like trippy visuals

Also want to give a shoutout to this too. As someone that’s dabbled in LSD, this movie gets the visuals surprisingly well Definitely not with them. They just aren't filmed as bad guys. All the shit they are doing is pretty horrible, but we just get that from common sense and our own personal rules. The movie is just like ""here's a cult doing cult celebration things, make of it what you will"". Made me think of *Gone With The Wind*, when Prissy said to put a knife under Melanie's pillow to cut the pain in two. I think I remember him saying that they celebrate midsommar every year, but that this particular midsommar feast only happens once every 90 years. So there is probably a may queen every year, but sacrificing 9 people is only for the big 90 year feast? Thank you,  I feel like this is an aspect of the ending that people kind of put to the side. Dani doesn't actually get better at the end, it's almost as if she's losing her mind. That's why she breaks out into that delirious smile and starts running in the flower dress before collapsing. The mushroom scene was super on point. CHRISTIAN “*I said sorry.*”

DANI “*Well it sounded like ‘too bad.’*” The way he make her feel bad and eventually apologize for what is, essentially, his fuckup is such a shitheel thing.  Him sulking and pouting like some kind of baby when he should have just at least acknowledged that ""surprise I'm going to Sweden without you"" is kind of a shock.  Then for her to end up apologizing for it was infuriating. This movie did a great job capturing how much she had intentionally blocked out how toxic he was because she just desperately needed someone to cling to at that point. Her pleas for him to stay and sit with her instead of being alone really hit me hard. I’m gonna need to dissect that head lady’s wallpaper. All I caught was a picture of a bear on fire, and spent the rest of the film waiting to see when they would burn the caged bear... I really thought it dragged towards the 2/3 mark. It will be a while before I rewatch. But I am curious about the symbolism and runes Am I stretching this too far, but in a scene where Christian and Dani are fighting it out in her house by the computer, behind them is a painting of an eagle flying and bleeding??? It looked like some winged creature. Oh I hadn’t thought of that. That’s a cool late ambiguous payoff for all the hallucinogen stuff in this movie. Can’t know for sure whether a detail like that was real. Nah, it was a parallel to the blood eagle torture method that vikings(?) used to use.  He was alive. The script makes it very clear that he is still alive. Holy fuck Or women wailing in a montage. So some anthropology students go to see a swedish cult's festival and *then* it starts getting weird Will you please lie down Man, everything he said during it was relatable. I liked that Will Poulter in this movie was kind of similar to his character in Bandersnatch, and how William Jackson Harper's character in this was a sort of similar nerdy guy to his character in The Good Place! Will Poulter and hallucinogenic drugs name a more iconic duo Oh my god A joke like that will make some people fume. For fuck sakes And one bear. It seemed like the ending harkened back to the self sacrifice business from the scene where they elders threw themselves off the rock. Christian was a part of her that she couldn’t let go and to approve him as part of the sacrifice was part of the closure she needed to move forward. i think after that he said ‘why would you do that?’ when the man clapped his hands Ah that’s amazing ""Ahthankyou"" - Austin Powers I definitely had that same thought His head looked like a watermelon at the end. I wonder if any of the other young members returning brought back outsiders too and they were just killed off screen in other rituals Of all scenes, my theater of a dozen or so people only laughed at the 2nd jumper landing weird and breaking his legs (which I didn't find remotely funny). Not a peep at the ""I think I ate one of her pubic hairs"" line. And 4 people walked out, including 2 right at the very end before the sacrifices. Weird audience. They clearly weren't ready for Ari Aster. I lost my shit when I first saw her in that chair drowning in flowers Definitely not two endings. I think people are referring to her “dancing” when she walks across the field in her flower-dress and it looks like it’s dancing/flowing Is the May Queen always a new girl? I agree. Ingemar was interested in her, so I assumed he wanted her in the group and that he could essentially just sacrifice/get rid of Simon and then get the girl.  It failed because Dani ended up coming along was a stronger fit (and perhaps because Ingemar underestimated the strength of Simon and Connie's relationship --- they seemed pretty in-sync and in love, unlike Dani in Christian who were clearly on the rocks). It just her singing voice check her old YouTube videos of her singing. She just has a deep voice That’s an old folk remedy. You put scissors or a blade under a pillow to “cut the pain”. The baby was teething. They described the incest prophet's mind as ""unclouded"" at some point. The fact that he's painting on a cloud at the end just furthers the idea that he's godlike, even if he's childlike and deformed. Also, in some divination methods, like the tarot, clouds represent air, which translate to themes of communication. I think it was just a cloud desk they made for him. My wife just made a cloud lamp like that for our nursery. It's just cotton wadding glued to a paper lantern shade. Yeah, taking photos of a sacred text without permission (even *asking* to do so) may be the biggest ""congratulations you're out of the PhD program"" in anthropological history. I kept thinking “Chidi, don’t do that!” Hahaha The singing and hand holding triggered it in my showing. People laughed at the lady pushing his ass and the part where the other lady grabbed his hand and he just looks so dazed and confused but both of those felt intentionally goofy to me. I think you're supposed to laugh. My theater laughed quite a lot and so was I and it all felt like part of the experience. I felt grateful I saw it in a full theater afterward. 

Also, one of the interviews I read with Ari he mentioned feeling relief when he heard laughter during the sex scene the first time he showed it to a full audience. “Yo grams why do u never support me?!” The scariest part of the film was the idea of doing shrooms after a horrible traumatic experience tbh Yeah her friends weren't empathetic, while Ingram was the one who offered her the tea instead to make her more comfortable I was tempted to tell them to leave I couldn’t imagine the damage lol Paramount has my repsect for giving mother! a wide release. There might be an element of this, but she’s shown to catch on to (confusing) movements very quickly - she’s genuinely in tune with the other women and performs very well. And there’s the trippy moment where she ‘understands’ the others through the language of dance and can speak to them, because she’s so in tune with the other dancers. Though the cult definitely was aware of more than they let on, I legitimately don’t think they were all aware of who she was, unless there was a line I missed. I read it as a happy accident - she got invited by Chris to placate her, not expecting she would want to come, and Pelle seems genuinely jazzed that she's coming not because she's a candidate for sacrifice, but because he's been watching Christian be a totally garbage boyfriend for as long as he's known them. My reading on it was that they had the perfect number of outsiders to sacrifice, and by chance, someone who lost her family and might fit perfectly into the cult is coming along too. Pelle seems to like her and care about her as a person. I was waiting for Pelle to try to manipulate her or seduce her, but he just kind of gently points out that Chris sucks and isn't supportive. They liked her because they knew that she is the kind of person that needs their community. The others would never abandon their lives, but they knew that she was broken, and were offering her a new life. ""the vikings grabbed all the best babes from other countries and dragged em over"" 

*camera focuses on Dani* I think they have the midsommar ceremony every year, but not necessarily the outsiders or the sacrifices.  This was like a special 90-year midsommar event.

Edit:  For anyone coming back to read this later, Ari Aster [clarified in his AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/cbxc8v/hi_im_ari_aster_writerdirector_of_midsommar_ama/etj2j1j/?context=1) No because once you’re 72 you’re *neck-chop-motion* Four are born through sex? But wouldn’t there way too many kids and not enough adults, if that were the case? I’m assuming Mark had sex with that girl before he died. The vomit is what fucked me up most. Absolutely, I just saw it and I can’t sleep. The hoses going upstairs and the sister’s face was too much Night and Day...  all the USA scenes were at night and all of the Sweeden scenes were in 'day'. When the answering machine didn't wake them up I thought for sure they'd be dead in bed but then we were deliberately shown the shot of them breathing, and I was like ""oh, okay... maybe they're just heavy sleepers?... can't believe that didn't wake them up though...""

Five minutes later: DAMNIT Unbelievable. The whole story, including depictions of each of the group members, is there! Thanks for linking that! that sun is super creepy It nails Will Poulter haha I don't know if it's because I know to look for foreshadowing in Aster's work now or if it really was that slap in the face obvious, but I didn't like how unsubtle that was. Yes. It was literally the love story on the tapestry. Yeah that part was weird I was like where the fuck did he get that cake so fast? lol Bro you just posted cringe bro I mean it's optimistic in the sense that Dani's boyfriend and social circle were in fact shittier than the crazy pagan murder cult... Yuuuup. I was 100% thinking about awkward conversations happening  after this film. classic aster.  relying on the used up old tropes Execution, not torture. Not possible to survive something like this, but the effect of the ""breathing"" lungs was mindfuckery. Same here. Classic “this is too uncomfortable to process” reaction. No judgement here, that was effed. I think Ari not only painfully and accurately shows how deeply people grieve, but that when they feel so alone the grief is unbearable and often fully unreachable. Dani constantly felt alone when it came to her family and also her relationship, and throughout the movie she tried to grieve but did so in secret so she never fully let it out. Only when she was with all of the girls/women did she completely break down because she was comforted by others who grieved in the same way she did.  She was no longer alone in her grief. The same thing goes for Hereditary. Toni Collette’s character was emotionally isolated, not having a true connection to anyone in her family, and she had trouble with grief as well. Speaking of Poulter, it was fucked how they gave him a jester hat when they burned his body [deleted] Ooh I forgot about that. That was solid dark. To me it looked like Dani almost accepted it towards the end of the crying/screaming? Like, she was freaked out and upset but as they all started crying with her she leaned into it and just accepted the pain and let everything out - with the exception of the first time she cries in the film, all the other times she's trying to hold it in and force herself to hold it together. When she finally gives in and truly grieves (not just for her family but for the relationship that should've died a long time ago), it's a moment of change/catharsis. The women all crying with her was just a catalyst for the realization My first thought when the film ended was ‘one must embrace the darkness to see the light.’ There are obvious themes of light vs dark throughout the film. When the camera flipped upside down on their drive, I thought about how concepts of light and dark were going to be challenged and skewed. At home, there didn’t seem to be an acceptance of her pain. Much like in American culture where people are consoled by phrases like “it’ll all be ok” and “they’re in a better place.” It seems like there is an avoidance of pain and discomfort and this is where people get stuck in their grief. In Sweden, her expression of pain was encouraged. Feeling the emotional pain of grief is an important part of the grieving process, and they encouraged her to do so. I believe that her choosing Christian to die was a symbol of her understanding that she would have to be embrace the darkness to once again find the light in her life. all i know is i might need therapy [deleted] 100% when the tree started like sliding I turned to my girlfriend and said this was exactly what my first trip was like I’m curious how “them being filmed as bad guys” would look, if you think they weren’t.

I’m not sure I agree that it’s fair to say that “luring people to your remote  commune under false pretenses, drugging them, psychologically and physically torturing them, then murdering them” is just a violation of “personal rules.” 

To me, the cultists generally happy, welcoming vibes while they’re going about all this immensely twisted stuff just added to the sense of creepy insane evil.

I guess I should just say that I don’t really buy that the film is some kind of statement on cultural relativism. 

The only two rational, entirely sympathetic people in the film were the couple from London, who were understandably upset when they were brought to watch a gruesome double suicide + brutal coupe de grace without any forewarning or consent, and then they were murdered just for wanting to leave. Hard to say. Seems implied that Eles parents were previous sacrifices but hat would mean it happens more often than 90 years. Hell yeah it was. “I don’t want any new people” lol. I’ve heard that so many times while tripping. You become instantly suspicious of and uncomfortable around the new person. Like — why are you here? What are your intentions? Haha. Narrator: She was right. He’s kind of a narcissist. He doesn’t have a lot of sympathy for anyone but himself throughout the whole movie. Textbook gaslighting There was also a picture of a queen(? Dani) with a bear(Christian) in her apartment. 

I'm sure there were others. And repetitive mouth sounds 

*tongue-click* That shit would have ruined my trip too M E T A No only 9 were killed I can understand people laughing at the cliff jumping scene for a few reasons. The scene was incredibly uncomfortable to watch because of the realism of the shots, the fact that the camera didn't pull away from the most horrifying parts, and the reaction of the two Londoners. Some people laugh when they're uncomfortable. Dani was crying loudly during that scene. She definitely wasn’t dancing I wouldn’t be surprised if it was orchestrated to end up that way tbh I love how they told Christian nah bro we don’t do incest and then they tell the black guy yeah man we hooked it up this so this kid could finger paint Yeah I totally understand anyone who was too weirded out to feel anything but disturbed in the moment, but I absolutely agree that scenes like that were played very intentionally to be comedic. I mean, it's supposed to be disturbing and uncomfortable, but for a lot of people their reaction to that is to laugh, and this movie *consistently* leaned into that (like the way they handled the bit of the pubic hair could have been played for pure weirdness or horror factor, but instead it was mostly played as comedic). > And there’s the trippy moment where she ‘understands’ the others through the language of dance and can speak to them, because she’s so in tune with the other dancers.

That was a really wild scene. I feel kind of dumb asking, but I don't speak swedish so I've been wondering if the two of them were actually speaking the language or if it was just gibberish? It *sounds* like gibberish and my theater was full of nervous laughter at that part because nobody knew if the characters really had a breakthrough or if they reached peak batshit crazy Something else I noticed after she was crowned the may queen, she had the herring sprung on her and she couldn't eat any of it, but the group wasn't horrified by her inability to do that. One of the elders praises her for doing the best she can and makes a joke even though it's done to tie into luck for everyone. I think you're both correct. There was a line about ""pure bloodlines"" in the film. There is also the connection between both Dani and Pelle coming to the commune after losing their own families. So I agree with both of you: Dani is a great fit for the commune in multiple ways. Yeah it's either that or they just say the 90 years thing to further entice their victims to get on board with it each year. I'm kind of more inclined to believe the latter since 1. one of the major points of the may queen is to choose the 9th sacrifice, and he showed her a picture of last year's May Queen and 2. Pele says his parents burned alive in a house fire, which I think is obviously a hint from Aster that his parents were willing sacrifices in a previous midsommar festival. His parents obviously can't be 90 years old so this hint makes me conclude it's a lie they tell (or maybe just Pele tells?) To make people believe it's a once in a lifetime thing they can't pass up. Pelle did say that one chick was born on the same day as him. So could be there were more people having sex on the commune Too fucking real for me it wasnt subtle, aster seems to know how to do subtle foreshadow (hell this movie was full of it), but that one scene did not feel that way.  i dont think it was supposed to be though, i think it was so when the scene where christian's cup is orange happens we know exactly whats going on.   this movie has parts where i imagine aster knows that the audience is smart enough to predict whats gonna happen, its just all about getting there.  the cliff scene i think is a prime example of this, we all knew that these two old folks were gonna jump off as soon as that cliff was shown, i think it made it even more painful to sit through. To each their own, but I don't feel like its inclusion really mattered because I don't think anything that it ""spoiled"" was intended to be a twist or a shock. The biggest ""surprise"" of the movie for me was how straight they played it. There wasn't any weird twist, or huge shift that keeps you on your toes. If you had only seen the teaser, the only big twist in the movie actually comes at the *start*, with its framing as a story of a relationship falling apart being quite unusual. The actual cult stuff was played very straight up, and wasn't really intended to shock or surprise at any point. For some people, that works, for others, that will be a bit boring. 

I personally loved it just because we get the other *so* often. It felt like it left more space for the movie to do what it did do really well (the way it looked at a culture from the anthropological perspective of these weird grad students, cataloging them with scientific precision, and the relationship drama), whereas I wouldn't have gained much from being ""surprised"" more by the direction the cult took. But to each their own, I totally understand people who want more of a suspenseful thriller setup where there's a mystery we spend the movie piecing together. But I do absolutely think there's an upside to *not* making the movie a mystery you try and crack: it lets the focus go elsewhere. But I know many horror fans will expect and prefer that style. I haven’t read the script (and I’m glad actually that I didn’t read it before I saw the film) but I thought maybe Pelle got the cake to give to Christian to give to Dani 🤷‍♀️ I laughed because of the ridiculousness of it all to be honest. Like they were seriously moaning In harmony with her. The ending when she looks in a glazed horror and then smiles made me shiver. Since that’s the ending it is, I’m guessing she finds her new family and probably won’t leave, like she could anyway. How the cult shared her pain was actually beautiful. It’s complicated just like life. I walked away and saw them more as liberators. And deeply in touch with the beauties of life. I mean...also wow how fucked up. “Skin the fool” Kind of weird how they only burned his skin and not the rest of his remains I knew he was dead as soon as he peed on the sacred tree Man I couldn't stop focusing on that once I noticed it. Also when the faces get exaggerated or the smiles get all weird. Honestly was one of the best depictions of being on mushrooms I've seen. It could also be that they were ""parents""; he did say that children are raised by the entire company. “I’m going to lay down. Seriously, everyone should lay down it’s so good. Josh could you please lay down.” 

Not word for word, but I found that part relatable as well. I felt bad for her. Her boyfriend was a dick and constantly guilted her into feeling bad when she was justified in being upset. Case in Point - 

Josh:  This is my thesis.

Christian  ...

Chrisitan:  This is my thesis. Yup, gaslighting Dani. Being a shit friend and selfish throughout the whole movie. He was the true antagonist. And upside down tracking shots

*ritualistic breathing* My theater laughed a lot at different scenes and to be honest I think Ari purposely makes uncomfortable scenes. He really gets to those emotions that unsettle people and I think many people laugh because of that. I believe they let her win as well, no way a depressed college student who has sleeping problems has more stamina than the women that live and work in the commune.

And isn't it easier to fall in and embrace your new family when they crown you Queen and carry you about like royalty? I read the script for the movie after watching it, and according to the script it's suppose to be gibberish. Dani isn't even suppose to be good at Swedish. The entire scene is basically written as the two women, one an outsider and one from the community, enjoying their time together and being able to dance in tune without actually communicating outside of expressive movements and sounds. 

Which reinforces the idea of Dani finding a new home in this community. Despite all her efforts to communicate with Christian (with words), they could never be on the same line. Pretty sure Pelle losing his parents in the fire was them as offerings in a previous Midsommar festival Yes, that was my understanding as well. It seems like they likely seek out youngish Anthropology/sociology students specifically and add in the 90 years thing as a way to easily entice them. Oh shit, you're very likely correct. 

And the fact this town couldn't possibly normalize violence to this level if it only happens every 90 years.... But them sacrificing people (even if only 3 of their own each year) wouldn't allow them to thrive. Their community would be too small.


Hmm, questions. [deleted] Also there was already someone that was pregnant because the lady said that the one who jumped gave her life for the unborn baby. There was also already a baby in the commune, I don't think that they only have four babies born every year during the festival. That part caught me off guard. I was expecting the messed up stuff at the 'retreat', but they threw one of the most disturbing scenes at me early on. In the original script the entire village (including Dani, Christian, etc.) watches an old short film depicting the entire love potion process with a young girl and boy. The slow pan across the mural is actually a much quicker and artful solution to the same exposition. And then the disabled kid in the corner...just watching (11 days late, sorry!) That shot really cemented my takeaway from the film. There are groups of people out there that prey on people who are in emotional duress. Religions. Cults. Pyramid schemes. These are all organizations in which its members feel connected and cared for...but people on the outside can see the manipulation occurring. Pelle entered the commune when he was grieving the loss of his parents, and he was excited to bring Dani in because he knew she was going through a similar situation. I think Pelle is actually trying to help Dani and does not totally realize that he is manipulating her into joining a cult, but the effect is the same. 

We look at Dani's choice and say ""Dani, don't do it! This cult is dangerous, manipulative, and robs you of a normal life."" But Dani isn't thinking about a normal life, all she can think about is the total loss of her family. Most of us simply cannot fully understand the fact that Dani only cares about finding a new family and is totally willing to give up a normal, complete life in order to find it. 

It's a great parallel for religion. Suicide bombers, street-corner preachers, middle-class families that are swindled into giving their retirement savings to the church, etc. all are convinced that a normal life is not as good as what they will gain from their religion. They are all now socially accepted and will do what it takes to maintain that acceptance, to the point where they will consider killing other people to maintain their life. Dani's friends could have ruined everything for the commune so they were killed. To the commune, these killings are acceptable because they allow the commune to continue living life in the way that they see fit.

I think there's also the shocking juxtaposition of the commune vs traditional western life. In the commune, it is encouraged to throw yourself off a cliff when you reach 72 years old. We see that as horrible whereas the commune considers it a normal part of life. Some people may see this as ""different strokes for different folks,"" but I think the message is quite the opposite. Throwing yourself off a cliff is obviously *not* a great practice, nor is murdering outsiders who won't conform or giving your crush a pube pie. But what do we do in our society that would be an outsider's version of throwing ourselves off a cliff? Obesity? Smoking? Factory farming? I think the film is a call for introspection in our own culture and a chance for us to stop normalizing destructive behavior.

Anyways, that was a rambling mess, but your comment really resonated with me. Oh FUCK They had to put something in the pies I knew he was dead as soon as I knew he was in this movie lol Haha yes. So many perfect lines and reactions there. Everyone obviously has experience.

He felt so uncomfortable and singled out that nobody was doing it with him haha. This line. Best example I’ve seen of someone tripping That solidified it for me I completely agree. One of the first women to fall had this kind of knowing smirk as she easily got up. They only need to replace 4 that and forgetting her birthday.  like got damn Even if they only replace 1, that's still too many. Look at the dinner table. There's under fifty people. That wouldn't allow a community to thrive for more than 20 years unless they're literally mostly killing the babies. While def cold, it would have arguably been somewhat understandable at least, what with jet lag, forever sun, drugs, and day naps. But when he soooo arrogantly sniped that guy’s thesis, it was like oh man, this is next level, intentional douchebagery. Not everyone may have been back. Some of the 18-36 years may not have returned. Also, I don’t recall seeing the little children at the dinner table. And then he totally threw Josh under the bus when the communal elders asked about the stolen book. 

When the movie ended, I turned to my friend and told her “now THAT is how you break up with a douchey boyfriend.” I hope she can avoid the nightmarish, horrifying murder. That would be nice. when he said that they weren't even really friends when talking to the elders i thought that was next level douche ",0
83,"I liked it a lot. Banderas gave the best male performance of the year imo. His work did not feel like acting. To me, the story was a metaphor comparing heroin (a drug that destroys you inside while creating an unbreakable attachment, offering a numbing gratification like a child being comforted) to the over-attached bad mother who loves and gratifies, but still tries to destroy who her child is (his sexuality) The more I think about it the more I believe Banderas deserves Best Actor. My favorite film of the year. I was so moved by it, and the performances are wonderful. It looks so beautiful that it feels dreamlike, but there’s also an incredible sense of realism. Love this movie. In a just world, Banderas would win the Oscar. I just finished watching this and while I’m going to have to go back and rewatch it because I was a little inebriated during the first and part of the second act, I couldn’t agree more with everyone’s sentiments about Bandera’s performance. The pain he portrayed solely through his eyes in certain scenes... wow. Thank you to Pedro Almodóvar for writing such an introspective piece of film. [deleted] Watched this on Imovies for .99 cents. I was sad when it ended, because I wanted the movie to continue longer. There was a sense of naturalness and realism that was very pleasing. And the end shot where one is shown the artificial process of film making was unexpected, funny and a tribute to film's power.  Seamless joining of artifice and realism.  Almodovar is such a humane, skilled writer/director!  Banderas very good too. I rented it on Google Play! I'm in Canada though so I'm not certain how available it is in other countries. If it hasn't hit your city yet it's probably not going to play theatrically there at all. I can only speak for Atlanta but we got it all the way back at the beginning of November. You should definitely rent it though, it's really great and probably my favorite Almodovar. ",0
161,"Loved it, but the cinematography should get all the awards. It was absolutely beautiful without drawing attention to itself. Amazing.  The opening sequence with the CinemaScope logo was so damn cool. 

The end was the most important. When they both see what could of been if they stayed with each other, it makes me think about our personal dreams. When we pursue our dreams are we sure we're pursuing the dream we absolutely want? Is there a road that we should of taken that would of made us happier. Being young and not knowing what I want to do with my life yet, this hit home hard, because I don't know if what I want is what I want and if it is what I want what windows will close when I take that road. Reminds me of a Sylvia Plath quote 

""I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.  From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked.  One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.  I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."" 
 One thing that surprised me about this film was how funny it was at times. I was legitimately guffawing in the theater. The key gag, the entire 80s cover band scene, etc. I really hope Ryan Gosling continues to take on comedic roles. He was fantastically hilarious in The Nice Guys, and did well here, too. I don't know if anyone else noticed this or if anyone said this, but this movie is literally a jazz song. Remember the one scene where Seb is describing jazz to Mia and how even though it can be the same song it is never played the same way twice and at different times the drummer or sax player might go off and do their own thing and play the song their way. And throughout the movie there would be times when they would just focus on Mia or Seb and the decision they are making (see Seb playing piano in the restaurant or Mia's final audition). Then in the final scene at the club we see how their lives could have been different together if they made different decisions. But they always start at the restaurant and end at the club. So just like a jazz song can be played a little bit differently depending on the musicians decide to play it, it still is the same song that starts and ends the same way. Just like they meet at the restaurant and end at the club.  It answers it's own questions. ""How can something be new while also being traditional?"" Like this. Just. Like. This. 

It is very meta in a really sly way. ""What if it's too nostalgic and people don't like it?""
""Fuck em"" The movie is nostalgic with its odes to classic jazz music, and classic films and uses repetition in the cinematography that is nostalgic in and of itself. But ultimately, behind all the subtleties and the clever allusions; it's just a very very brilliant love story, in an age that's become too cool for them. 

10/10   What a treat. But I'll tell you the moment my heart broke.  Emma Stone's character says earlier in the film when talking about jazz ""I always thought it was something that people put on in the background when they talk to each other.""

Gosling freaks out and says that's the antithesis of it, and that real jazz needs to be experienced live, that's what it's about.

But later, when the pair of them are arguing for the first time and Gosling's in his sell out band, what's playing in the background? A classic jazz record. Gosling had forgotten his roots and what made Emma dig him in the first place. Dang shame, man. I want to dress like Ryan Gosling does in this movie  My god those last 15 minutes absolutely tugged my heart in all directions. Perfect way to cap off a dazzling film. This was such a fantastic film to watch. Really lifted my spirits after a troublesome year. My only complaint is that it's not as ""musical"" as I hoped it'd be. It has all of these wonderful musical numbers in the beginning, but there's a surprising lack of them during the middle of the movie.  In the early scene where Sebastian and Mia first meet in the restaurant, I was floored that they didn't use the scene from the trailer. I realize they used it later, but in that moment they seriously had me guessing that they used it in the trailer just to throw me off for the actual movie -- I loved it. For those haven't seen it yet: Enjoy the last remaining moments of your life without having ""City of Stars"" stuck in your head  Really loved the movie, and I'm sure many others have noticed this, but I haven't seen anything written about it yet. This film was very similar to Casablanca in terms of its plot/themes. I think this is why they reference Casablanca on the studio lot, and in the montage at the end, the plane flying across the globe to Paris was like Casablanca's imagery.

But think about it, Mia and Sebastian have a ""theme"" in the same way that Rick and Ilsa had ""As Time Goes By"" as their theme. Additionally, they do not end up together in much the same way, as they both have to live their respective lives and thus can't be together. Just like Rick and Ilsa will ""always have Paris"", Mia and Sebastian will always have Los Angeles. That ending was so sad and sweet, and it really made me think of Casablanca, even in the way that Mia's new husband seems like such a good guy, just how Victor was a great man in Casablanca, conflicting our feelings about the way the main couple does not end up together.

What do you guys think? Absolutely beautiful movie, by the way.  I liked how the ending was primarily from Mia's perspective. Had it worked out, Seb could not have lived his dream. He would have had a great life, playing in a jazz band in Paris and having kids with her, but it wasn't his ultimate dream.

And that's what this film does so well - it's about two ppl who fall in love and help each other reach their dreams...They just don't end up together. After watching Rogue 1, Manchester by the Sea, Moonlight, and Jackie. This movie affected me on levels I knew I had but never realized before and absolutely every minute of it whiplash and now La La land have officially fucked me up One line that stuck to me was when Seb said:

""It's LA, where people worship everything, but value nothing.""

I think that applies to a lot of places, but here in LA I see it. There's many historical spots that back in the day were popular, awesome, or just part of culture or held importance. Then today those places are either closed down, torn down and replaced by a skyscraper or something else, or not valued at all. Angel's Flight was something I saw it often growing up and seeing it go up and down in the middle of the day made me want to ride it one day. It looked cool. Now it's closed (temporarily I think) and it bums me I never got to ride it. 

A lot of places basically require someone to claim it and take care of it, government to landmark it, or support of a group. Otherwise, it's lost forever because the general population moves and doesn't value the importance of it. That's what's happening to Jazz. That's what Seb is worried about. Jazz has an important historical impact but it's sound is being changed. Seb doesn't think it's right for traditional Jazz to die out, but no one cares because it's no one is valuing it.

Just my take on that quote. It hit me hard. Was pretty deep.  La La Land is everything beautiful about cinema. 

The film is about keeping art fresh, exciting and alive, and Chazelle uses the language of film to its fullest to do exactly that. The performances are stellar, the colours are popping, the cinematography is beautiful, and the soundtrack is already one of my favourites of all time - it's amazing how powerful a simple piano motif can be. 

It has no shame being romantic and open about its ideas about passion and ambition, and expressing it as a musical was the perfect choice. I watched an advanced screening and have been telling everyone to go see it. Give Mr Chazelle all your money! Also, I love subtly clever titles.

Dare I say... 10/10. Thank god Ryan Gosling played Sebastian.  Miles Teller (who was cast before they dropped him) is a great actor, but I feel like he would have come off as too much of a jerk.  He was much better suited for Whiplash. So can we talk about one of the major themes in this film - the idea that people dream and sometimes those dreams are foolish and futile but the very act of chasing those dreams can be quite magical. It's romantic and yet heartbreaking but also, I think, *vital*.

I walked out of the cinema and as I walked out two older women were chatting about the film and out of the blue they turned to me and another couple standing in the aisle and asked us if we liked it. I said yes. The other guy was a bit nonplussed. The older woman starts talking about Mia's audition scene and she goes ""You know, life is short. You should try a bit of everything. Don't waste your chances because you never when those chances could be gone. And when they're gone, they're gone""

And that started a wonderful conversation about the film and just life in general. It resonated so much with me. So... here's to the fools who dream. Keep the dream alive! Review: Had to pee ten minutes in and didn't leave until the movie ended. 10/10 would endure again saw it on Thursday, so breathtaking, my theater applauded for this film, anyone else? Me: just fuck my shit up

La La Land: say no more fam The Griffith Observatory sequence was done just so beautifully. After they kiss and it did that little fade out, my theater erupted with applause.

But the ""What Could've Been"" Sequence at the end, my god, that was done so masterfully. The culmination of every song woven together, the performances, the damn emotions, all with a ""The End"" title card. 

This whole film reignited my passion for filmmaking when I have been in a bit of a dry spell and really made me feel just so grateful to be (hopefully) working in this industry professionally one day. 

It is such an inspirational film to the people who want to follow their dreams, but isn't afraid to tell you the truth about what happens if you do go for them. 

This is an honest and insightful film with such powerful direction and an amazing soundtrack that hasn't gotten out of my head for the past week. 

This is why I appreciate when a studio is not afraid to take risks, Chazelle has only wrote and directed ONE major motion picture, and yet, they trusted him every step of the way to make an ORIGINAL musical for 10x the budget of Whiplash and not only succeeded, but has gotten critical acclaim and has been starting to pick up the awards. He mentioned that this was his passion project and damn well shows. 

Congrats to the entire cast and crew for making a damn near perfect film that I will be watching many times to come! This was my favorite movie this year. I saw it two days ago and can't get the music out of my head. I think I've fallen in love with Emma Stone. 

Did anyone notice how the final scene was basically Casablanca? Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine (with her husband). Then they listen to a piano piece and imagine what could've been. But in the end it wasn't meant to be.

I *personally* was very disappointed that they didn't stay together in the end. I totally understand why, and it was very reminiscent of Casablanca and An American in Paris with the bittersweet ending. The only thing I would say is Hollywood Oscar movies try to shy away from happy endings over the past few years because the ""happily ever after"" ending is considered silly. (Even La La Land mocks the idea.) BUT the movie was FULL of ""happily ever after"" events. The barista gets discovered and becomes a huge star. That doesn't happen in real life! That's silly. And grumpy losers don't get invited into popular bands. Haha. I mean there's a scene of dancing in outer space for crying out loud. There's already so much happiness and silliness and rule bending in the movie, a ""happily ever after"" ending would've worked fine. 

The bittersweet ending of Casablanca works so much better because it had to be that way. Rick couldn't get with the women he loves because she was married (and the dude was a great guy), and as a couple they were so important to the war effort. In La La Land, it's like they couldn't be together.... because??? It's not even like the excuse was that Mia was too busy for a relationship (she ended up getting married anyway) or that Ryan Gosling's character had something to do that would prevent him from being in a relationship (he just played a piano lol).

I thought the ending was very well done, but personally would've enjoyed a happy ending more. Even if the characters weren't together, just hint that they *could* be together if they chose. Maybe I'm just a sucker. This film had a heart like (500) Days of Summer, and the song and dance numbers were so well-written. It's an unapologetic romance, the antithesis to these cynical and bitter times we're going through at the moment. as someone who lives in LA, how does Ryan Gosling go from the Warners Lot  in Burbank to Hermosa Beach in time for the sunset? Were you even trying Damien Chazelle? 2/10 literally unwatchable...

But seriously this is a landmark achievement. Loved everything about this movie. Don't think I've met a single person with anything bad to say about it. Director and Picture are a lock and I hope Emma edges Natalie Portman out for the Oscar. (Also bets on when the musical adaptation hits Broadway?)

And oh my god the ending sequence. The whole ""what could have been..."" just tugged on my heartstrings and left me wonderfully bittersweet. Bravo to everyone involved I'm gonna be honest here, I don't like being reactionary, but as someone who is in musical theatre and loves movies so much, this is one of the 2 or 3 best movies I've ever seen. I've seen it twice and i listen to the soundtrack daily and it just blows me away. Just saw it a second time - just as perfect as the first time around - now preparing for at least a few more viewings over the holiday break (Gonna take different people in my circle each time)!

Something I don't recall anyone in this thread talking about was that [during my first viewing, for a long while during the scene of Mia's ""Five Years Later..."" life I was still trying to convince myself that all the scenes of her coming home, kissing her husband, greeting her toddler, etc. were actually of her filming a movie on set - and that she would return to her *actual* home to greet Sebastian afterward. It wasn't until Mia and her husband actually went into the jazz club and she became aghast at the ""Seb's"" logo that I felt utterly *crushed*.](#spoiler) - I wonder if anyone else here had the same wishful thinking? A lot of hype for this movie and I have to say it lived up to it tremendously. You dont get movies made like this anymore. Especially from a technical and artistic standpoint. It also seemed to capture the Hollywood spirit very well. My favorite scene other than the [what if Hollywood ending](#spoiler) must be the second musical piece with the roommates. it was just Divine  As an LA driver, I couldn't help but feel a certain rage when everyone got out of their cars on the freeway. This may legitimately be my favorite movie I've ever seen. My heart was pounding during that last dream sequence, wanting it so badly to be real even when I knew it wasn't. Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz created a masterpiece. As much as I loved this movie, did anyone else think the sound for the ensemble numbers was very quiet? I've seen it twice now and both times I could barely hear what the ensemble cast was singing besides of course Ryan, Emma, and John. It seemed like the instruments played over the lyrics a lot in the beginning.  As someone who doesn't even like musicals or romance films, this is an instant classic. Legitimately one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The movie did something incredible in that it made me emotional, not because it was brutal and emotionally-taxing like most movies that do that are like, but because of its beauty, positivity, and just general air of excitement. Movies like this are honestly so hard to come by. It was just such a wonderful experience throughout. 

Also, so many amazing sequences, but my god that opening highway scene was incredibly well-done. The effort that must've went into that scene alone is insane. This movie was beautiful. Made my gf want to tear up and she never fucking does. I loved this and probably my favorite of the year.

Do not worry City of Stars will leave your head eventually :) Oh man, I'm sitting here crying thinking about that ending sequence. I know that they both were content with their lives at that point, but like, the alternate reality was so much happier. It's not like they had anyway of knowing which reality would have made them happier since the only experienced the one that we saw.

I legitimately felt, and to some extent still feel, that bitter emptiness that accompanies heartbreak.  I am so glad they didn't end up together. As someone who normally hates romantic films for their predictable plots, it was refreshing to see them end up apart. Also allowed for the amazing final scene of them imagining what could have been That bittersweet ending killed me :( This was a really nice movie. I thought the ending was fantastic, something Chazelle also nailed with Whiplash. I wonder what his writing process is like.

Charming is the best way to put it. I can't wait to see how it does at the Oscars. It's not my favorite movie of the year, but it's definitely a must-see. I actually liked this film more than Whiplash (which seems to be a somewhat uncommon opinion here)

-I felt that the entire premise of Whiplash was ridiculous because A) Fletcher would have been fired a long time ago at any music school between FumBuck Ohio to Juillard
B) Jazz is not just about playing charts very fast, it's about musicality, improvisation, rhythm, texture e.t.c as well. It's not like some Chopin piano competition where precision and technique are largely the end goals. 

Obviously, Whiplash had many great qualities: Teller and Simmons had outstanding chemistry, it was very well shot, the music was memorable. 

La La Land didn't have such plot constraints and was much more ambitious in scope (and largely succeeded in its aspirations). It pays tribute and borrows from so many films (Singin in the Rain, Jacques Demy, Astaire/Rogers), without ever feeling really derivative.  Ryan and Emma, this combo never fails me once again.

Crazy, stupid, love was one of my favs. I thikn deservingly the most beautifully created piece of art film of 2016. And I don't mean just visually. Since last 2 days I cant shake off this realyl feel good feeling i am getting from the film. I just feel so happy and warm! Its the same feeling I got after I watched Secret Life of Walter Mitty. So this isn't an important point at all, but this is the first movie I've seen that felt timeless (as in could have been set in any time period) that had mobile phones in it. So often you see people using tech in a movie and it instantly puts you in a defined time period (space ships are future, chunky old computers are 90s). This movie somehow has mobile phones and jokes about everyone at a party driving a Prius and still feels like it could be set in the 50s or 60s.



 I'm probably too late to get to the discussion, but I wanted to put this down somewhere -- 

The ending is especially brutal for me because even though both are clearly okay with where their lives went and the fact that they achieved their dreams, it leaves me wondering hard about what a dream costs -- what we have to pay to make it happen, and if fully accomplishing it is even possible. 

It's a big dilemma for 20 somethings, art loving, art creating types.

I love this movie, though. Absolutely one of my favorites, immediately. As someone who gave up their dreams of moving to LA to try to be a writer to move back in with their parents and pick a more reasonable career, this film was a gut punch. So glad I didn't go see this with my parents over Christmas, Mom would've been devastated  If you enjoyed the film and want recommendations on what films to see next [here’s a list of excellent musicals (and a few non-musicals) that directly inspired the film!](http://imgur.com/gallery/4KetX) I really enjoyed this film. Whiplash is my favorite film of all time so I went into this with very high hopes.

I loved the cast, the music, the costumes, the entire style of the movie, it all captivated me.

However, one of the things I most appreciated about this film was the fact that- despite the songs and dance and overall dreaminess of it- it seemed believable. I believed the story and the characters.

A note about the ending. I think the main takeaway from this is that it's not about falling and love and happily ever after. It's about the people you meet who change you. You know that you'll always love them, and vice versa, but sometimes life gets in the way and it doesn't work out. The last words they say to each other, ""I'll always love you"", and the smile and nod they give to each other at the end. That's the part I appreciated most about it.

This movie didn't disappoint me in any respect, I definitely plan to see it again in the near future. One of the most charming and captivating experiences I've had in a movie theater all year.  Saw this movie 5 hours ago and still can't stop thinking about it and crying a little over the ending. I feel like my interpretation of the ending is a bit different from a lot of what I'm seeing on here, [a lot of people see the last montage as a ""what could've been"" scenario, but to me it seemed like the message was that the narrative depicted there was an idealized, perfect Hollywood story that never could have happened in real life. It starts with Seb kissing Mia completely out of the blue at the club, and goes on to depict his boss as being an upbeat guy instead of the tense man he actually was, and shows Mia performing her play in front of a full house instead of a small group. All of these changes make for an overall unrealistic and unattainable story. To me, this represents the classic, cookie cutter Hollywood movie that La La Land is not, even with the movie's nods to classic Hollywood. This overly idealized ending also could illustrate that Mia and Seb's romance was a product of convenience and timing, and not a result of the pair being ""soul mates.""](#spoiler) Loved the movie.

Wasn't till weeks later that I noticed the irony by the film's end:
[Sebastian and Mia have achieved their dreams at the expense of their relationship. But the thing is, neither would've found the success they were looking for without each other. Without Mia's insistence, Sebastian might've simply continued living gig to gig and never made enough or gotten famous enough to open his own club. And if not for Sebastian's pushing, Mia would've never gotten that audition and probably returned home to Nevada for good. Ultimately, it was their love for one another that caused them to split apart. Heartbreaking.](#spoiler) I like to think that JK Simmons' character is the twin brother of JK Simmons' character in Whiplash and he hates jazz because his brother is such a jerk about jazz. It's interesting that all the dancers/actors in the opening number actually probably are going through the same thing the characters are set up to go through (moving to a big city and hoping to be discovered). Loved that energy and got me engaged since the very beginning til the end. And the Academy Award for Best Picture goes to....

La La Land. 

Holy shit, what a movie. I just got back from a Friday night showing.  I'm not really a musical person, yet I really enjoyed this movie.  A love-story musical is a recipe for being quickly dismissed as light fluff by many moviegoers, yet I really appreciated how La La Land addressed the difficulties of achieving what you want to do in life.  Emphasis on the doing part.  It's less about whether two people will get together and live happily ever after, and more about two people each trying to do what they love.  Anyway, I could write a lot about this movie, so I'll just share some random things I liked:  [1. starting the movie with a classic LA traffic jam that transitions into the movie's first song.  The final shot of endless cars on the expressway with a person standing on each one was major eye-candy for me.  2. I liked how the planetarium scene was one of the more dream-like parts yet was fairly low-key.  The movie saved the epic montage stuff for the epilogue near the end of the movie.  3. The scene in which Emma Stone says there is no way she's going to the major audition, and Ryan Gosling yells ""WHAT?!""  It was probably his only outburst the entire movie, and it was great like a well-timed f-word in a PG-13 movie.  4. Emma Stone from start to finish, especially the funny bit when she playfully dances to Gosling's band's music, as well as her ""crying like a baby"" breakdown when he tells her about the big audition opportunity.  I found it surprisingly moving, and I'm glad that Gosling's reaction was both realistic and comedic.  5. The couple's arguments were realistic and not overly dramatic: showing up to each other's performances, going on tour, etc.  6. ""City of Stars""  7. The colors   8. The balance between songs and normal scenes.  For a musical, it didn't feel like an endless stream of songs.  9. One more time: everything Emma Stone](#spoiler) I felt like Chazelle essentially called his own shot via the John Legend scene. He loves old movies/musicals, but they need to be redone in a way that young people enjoy them.

Hit a homer too.  The ending epilogue scene is by far one of my favorite shots in a film. Absolutely loved the scene of Mia and Sebastian dancing around all the lights while the ground looks like they are dancing on water  I think Chazelle has taken over Woody Allen's job as this generation's definitive filmmaker who incorporates jazz into everything. Emma Stone stole the show. Mia's audition scene where she sings about ""fools who dream"" was an absolute highlight. 

The ending and how it takes us back to the start to show you what could have been and then hits you back with reality was just heart wrenching.

I walked out of the cinema humming and on a high. Just reminded me of how magical films can be. Completely took me in and left me feeling so much for both Mia and Sebastian.  Unless ""Silence"" turns out to be ""Goodfellas""-level Scorsese, there's no contest for 2016's Best Picture: it's ""La La Land."" I will just say please go and watch this film. Trust me, it's worth it. The ending of that movie ripped my heart apart.  [deleted] Just saw it today, wow. Such a beautiful yet somber love letter to Hollywood. I was wrapped up in the music, the visuals, and of course the sweet and sincere chemistry that Ryan and Emma have in every movie they're in together. I couldn't help but feel this sense of dread all throughout the movie, thinking; ""this isn't going to end well"". Last quarter of the movie, eyes welled up realizing that they don't end up together and then the montage of ""what could have been"" played, and the tears started rolling down (I rarely cry if that means anything). The movie made me reflect upon the reality that as one gets older you're stuck with the decisions that you've made and I often find myself looking back and thinking how different my life would be if I went a different path here and there. But life is not a Hollywood movie -- not La La Land where everything works out perfectly. For Mia and Sebastian, sometimes achieving their dream is worth more than the love they had and that's perfectly fine. People come and go in your life but that doesn't lessen their lasting impact on you. They both realized that and walked away, secure in the fact that the love they have for each other will always be there, even if they're not together. Cameramen pov of shoots:

I whipped it up quick so not the greatest quality but you get the idea. [WHY THE FUCK CAN'T PEOPLE END UP TOGETHER FFS, I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS MOVIE BUT THE FUCK CAN'T SEB AND MIA END UP WITH EACH OTHER PLS](#spoiler) Late to this discussion, will probably be buried. IMO, this was one of the most beautiful film to have ever grace the big screen. 

In seemingly majority opinion, this movie failed in explaining to the audience why Mia and Seb did not end up happily ever after, or why the movie ended with a flashback with their love for each other.

This film... is NOT ABOUT LOVE! This film is about the/a dream, whether it be career goals or dream of love. From the intro soundtrack to the name of the movie, La La Land starts with ""Another Day of Sun"", already incorporating the feel of pursing this mystical dream in Hollywood.
Second song ""Someone in the Crowd"", again gives audience another sense of the infinite possibility of the world. The magic that tonight is the NIGHT! 
Two major events in this film, one is Mia and Seb's first argument in encouraging Seb to pursue his dream... second, is the big turning point when Seb went to Mia's house and calls her immature for giving up on hers. Again, its about pursuing the ""dream"".
I don't want to write too much so I'll point out two major moments. One is ""City of Stars"" solo by Ryan Gosling, the last line ""Or one more dream that I cannot make true?"" and Emma Stone's ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"".
This whole movie revolves around the beauty and pain of the dream, how seemingly we all chase and dream of what we cannot attain. That even in failure, we would all still pursue this ""dream"" again.

And the ending... ohhhh How beautiful the ending was... it perfectly embodies the beautiful sorrow of not obtaining the ""love"" dream... a dream that we all want... I can go on and on... this movie was absolutely phenomenal. Not just your regular guy saves girl, or girl has cancer, guy gives everything he has for her. End. But a new era movie, where both men and women are equal, equally pursuing their dreams, and when they were not in the same path... they acknowledged each other's love and understood it was just another, ""Or one more dream that I cannot make true?"" ""What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it?""

""That would be insulting. Is it true?"" [deleted] Damien Chazelle for President 2016.

Seriously though, first Whiplash, then this, credit where credit is due, the guy's talented. I hope this at the very least sweeps up all the technical awards like Grand Budapest Hotel. Fantastic film! I hope Stone and Chazelle get the recognition they deserve come the Oscar's. I'm still an emotional mess. [MFW someone asks how many times I've seen La La Land](http://i.imgur.com/qc6ikHK.jpg) So I've seen this movie 3 times because I'm a fucking sap, but this is what keeps bothering me: Mia became a famous actress so she definitely would have been back in LA many times during those 5 years. In all those years, she never reached out to the one person who saved her from giving up on her dream? Someone she claimed to love forever, someone who loved her, and someone without whom she wouldn't have had her dreams? If that's the case, then maybe she didn't love him as much as he loved her. It's clear from the name of the club and the song he dedicates to her at the end that he still thought about her and their time together during those 5 years, and he probably still loves her, but she seems to have moved on completely. Which leads me to think that she became as much a part of his dreams as the jazz club and while she got all she wanted, he only achieved half. 

: ( Been playing Mia & Sebastian's theme all day it sure pulls on the heartstrings.  Just saw this last night so kinda late to the party, but oh man, what a phenomenal film. I was hooked from start to finish, and I honestly couldn't think of a part that I disliked (maybe it was a little too fast-paced in the beginning? eh). 

[Also I think I understand why Mia didn't end up with Sebastian at the end. Sebastian was essentially locked into doing tours and recordings for who knows how long until he could find the money to start his club, and since Mia got the role for the movie, she would be away in Paris to film for a decently long amount of time, and then she would be off doing other movies too afterwards since the movie implied she became a successful actress. Considering that the two's relationship was already becoming a little shaky, they just didn't have time to see each other as much as they used to, and because of that it would make sense that Mia would inevitably find someone else. The ending was incredibly bittersweet and tragic, but what happened occurred as a result of the two finally achieving their dreams that they have wanted to achieve for a long time. One thing that I thought was really clever was how the alternate reality part showed that if the two stayed together, Sebastian never would have opened his club, but they would still be happy together. Considering that in reality the two looked incredibly bleak and dull although they ""technically"" achieved their dreams, it makes you think if their actual dream was to be with each other.](#spoiler)

The ending as a whole is very powerful and well done, and it adds to an already excellent movie. I already want to watch this movie again and I don't think it'll go away from me any time soon.  [deleted] So I'm one of those film people who's generally harsh on newer films and isn't quick to call them all-time favourites. Whiplash, however, is in my top 10 of all-time. La La Land is top 30. We have someone special on our hands.

Trust me, if you're game for it, you'll get swept up from the first frame. Damien Chazelle has a sense of rhythm, chemistry and drama that I'm going to compare to the best of Bob Fosse (on film). I'm kinda bracing myself for the backlash here though - there's a lot of Whiplash's DNA in La La Land. They're not cousins, they're siblings. I'm hoping that Chazelle has something else up his sleeve so he's not a one trick pony - for now, we have this cotton candy treat that makes my eyes well up and puts a lump in my throat from all its hope and bittersweetness. When the tagline says 'here's to the fools who dream,' that's exactly who the film is for.

It's destined to win Best Picture at the Oscars at this point, and I'm hoping for the biggest sweep since Slumdog Millionaire. The technical aspects are stunning - this is Goodfellas/Boogie Nights level photography. I have way too many positive things to say. So I'll limit it to this: I'm not that into musicals. It's not that I don't appreciate the work that goes into the choreography, or that I can't suspend disbelief when people burst into song. It's that the type of music in musicals just isn't my thing. It always seems to have this campy, overly theatrical style that I don't care for. I can usually deal with it in the context of the movie or play but let's just say you won't find me listening to the Rocky Horror or Wicked soundtracks on their own like I might with my favorite instrumental film scores. Because of that, musicals tend to drag for me even if they have a decent story. I just can't get into them like a lot of people can, because the story has to stop every few minutes for a song I'll most likely never want to listen to again. 

I loved every second of this movie, including and especially all the music. Every scene, every song, was pure magic. I bought the soundtrack at Barnes & Noble today during my Christmas shopping after seeing it for the first time last night. The way the themes are used to further the story is brilliant. The score is beautiful and so well-arranged, and the songs are so ridiculously catchy and infectious and full of joy you can't help but love them. [The song Emma Stone sings for her big audition scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwjalGJo7vA) gave me goosebumps in the theater. Maybe the music really is that much better than other musicals. Maybe Chazelle is just that good a director and managed to bring the songs to life onscreen like he did with the jazz pieces in Whiplash (which were great on their own, as someone who likes jazz) - seriously, that opening scene on the freeway or the dance at the observatory, holy shit this man was born to direct extended scenes based around a piece of music. But whatever the reason is, I've never felt this attached to the soundtrack of a musical before. 

Gosling and Stone were brilliant of course. The script is a classic Hollywood romance with a nice modern twist. Great cinematography, editing, all that. But what really amazed me about this was that I went to see a musical almost solely because I loved Whiplash, expecting to be moved by the story but not the singing, and ended up humming the songs all the way home. Thank you, Justin Hurwitz. Thank you, Damien Chazelle. Thank you to everyone who made La La Land. It's a great movie that just makes you feel good inside, which is something we need right now. See it alone, see it with your girlfriend, see it with your grandparents, see it with your grouchy twentysomething friend who doesn't like musicals. Just see it! I absolutely loved this movie, I think it's actually better than Whiplash and that's saying something because Whiplash is such a great movie. 

I love the music, the bittersweet ending, the cinematography. What I think is really superb about the film is it's inventiveness and it's creativity with shot types and lighting and editing. It's hard to explain, the whole movie is just so immaculately executed and brilliantly constructed. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are both excellent in it and their chemistry is brilliant. I think what I love most about the film is the combination of reality and fantastical music numbers is balanced perfectly, it never feels contrived or abrupt, it just flows perfectly and when they float off dancing in the planetarium, you don't question it, you just go with it. I would give it 10/10. Here's what got me, the movie centered around an idea that following your dreams means making sacrifices and the idea of doing what makes you happy vs doing what is safe. This idea is pretty damn cliche but what this movie gets right is that it focuses on what you leave behind when you choose one thing over another. We see the two stars willing to take chances to follow their dreams but what we see through out is that they can never seem to find a way to be happy together while also being happy with themselves. So when the end rolls around and we see [that they have both achieved the dream they set out to live and they are apart the audience suddenly is filled with a sadness. This is achieved because the story focused on what we leave behind when we follow our dreams. Pursuing your passion means making sacrifices. The sacrifice they made that they didn't foresee, was each other.](#spoiler) The film ultimately asks one question of our two protagonists; ""Are they happy?"" And from here the audience questions, ""Can they be happy?""





 I watched it twice, and I just realized what the best description of watching La La Land for me is.

It's like one's first kiss. Before I saw the movie, I heard from different people how great it is, and how I really have to try it. Everybody's doing it, it's so amazing! So I go to watch it, and when the movie is starting, my adrenalin starts to rise. Oh boy oh boy this is it, this is it! But then, at the last moment, a touch of doubt. Wait, what if it's not all it's cracked up to be? What if I won't know how to react?

But then it starts, my eyes widen, the world becomes filled with light and color and just...joy. It's a wild ride, but I just let go and enjoy it. And when it's all over, I want to do it again, this time with more attention to detail.

---------------------------------------

So, yeah. If you ever want to experience being kissed for the first time again, it now only costs around 10 bucks. Quite a steal. The movie ending hit me hard like a truck, it made me really sad. It reminds me of all the thing happened of my first love (and the only). It started off cute and fun then it took a trip to discuss dream and reality. It would've been a more joyful ending if it didnt show us the last minute of Mia waking up from dream to the reality and left us an open ending. Sebastian is of course sacrificed more and love Mia more than she does , the director was a musican and it follow the usual path of the Titanic man sacrificed himself for a woman romantic theme and i dont need to explain why.  This movie hit me hard as a train and like other people commenting, it relates to the struggle of an artist no matter what your passion is. I couldn't help but tear up at the end. It was good I don't know why but Ryan Gosling shaking his head is so funny. The chemistry between Emma and Ryan just oozes off the screen. It reminds me of a long since past relationship between me and an ex that had a similar trajectory and ending. The moment in the theater where they sneak their hands together and then lean in for the kiss... I could feel the same electricity between them that I had felt when I did the exact same thing with my ex. 

I hope those two continue to make films together. 

This was a fantastic film and well worth the wait to see. Instant classic in my book.  What really gets me about this film is how it has these tributes to old Hollywood/musicals in its set pieces (someone in the crowd, another day in the sun, astaire/rogers in the dance scene, hollywood what-if sequence) combined with these wonderfully somber personal moments (the theater scene, the dinner fight, audition scene, finale)

The effect of this is making the film feel so very personal, like we're stepping into this timeless Hollywood dream. For me, (and many others), this really strikes a personal chord. 


 Excellent movie, 10/10 deserves oscar for best picture. It was so classical!! It reminded me of Singin' in the Rain & the like!! Make more movies like this Hollywood, PLEASE!! I want MORE TAP NUMBERS!!!

[BUT, it had the saddest ending ever. They both realize that their ""dreams"" weren't worth it. Basically, what I get out of this is DON'T BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU LOVE. Because no matter what, doing anything with that person is going to be better than doing anything without them. Sebastian made a huge mistake by not going to france. Sure, he got his club. But who's to say he wouldn't have still gotten it if he had gone to paris??? That's all I'm saying. He gave her up for nothing, and now they both have to live with it. This was the most heart-breaking ending ever. But I still loved it. Even though I hated it.](#spoiler) What I liked the most was no happy ending. The movie leaves you with a sense of devastated optimism, forced to accept the way life changes and further appreciate every little choice we make.

The soundtrack is really good, even if you don't think so at first. The middle part to Someone in the Crowd that repeats several times is just a PERFECT hook to serve as the the emotional theme song for the entire movie. Gosling's voice seems awkwardly deep at first, but quickly for me became irrelevant. I think this is a good example of how enthusiasm and honest passion are better than raw talent.

Anyways, this movie isn't great because of any one reason. It's an old story, it's Hollywood looking romantically in a mirror, but it's just so spot on emotionally to what we all experience as human beings. The ending is perfect, a tribute to life itself.

It's not that it's such a spectacular movie, it's that it has spectacular effect. I felt like I made a lot of peace in my life just by watching. I am still in a romantic mood nearly a week later. I think people saying this is the best movie or musical they've ever seen are probably just blinded by the emotion still, but there's nothing wrong with that. Life is beautiful, even with pain, and that's what this movie celebrates so wonderfully.

There aren't really enough songs to consider this a true musical like My Fair Lady or Chicago (my personal two favorites) but all the same I've never seen a musical set in modern times that was actually good, until this one. 

 I just saw this movie today and I honestly have to say, this was by far my best movie of 2016! This movie charmed the hell out of me and was able to pull off something I've really never seen in a movie which was being able to be at times a huge spectacle of a movie while, also being very quiet and reserved at others.

Stone and Gosling have some of the best chemistry I've seen in actors in years past and I loved how well they worked off of each other.

The soundtrack was amazing and even though I only saw it not even 6 hours ago I already have pretty much every song on my phone and have had it on repeat for ours now (I think my personal favorite is A Lovely Night, that scene was amazing.)

However, I think my favorite thing about this movie is that on the surface it completely seems like just another musical but, if you just look a little deeper it has some really strong things to say about chasing your dreams and relationships and the fact that the two don't always intertwine. I think this movie was probably the best example I've ever seen of the quote, ""if you love something let it go."" Sebastian easily could have not told Mia about the audition and just let her live at home with her parents and give up but, he cared about her just enough to know that she needed to achieve her goals even though he knew what that meant for their relationship. He was willing to let her chase her dreams as she had forced him to chase his and put her wellbeing and happiness before his even though he knew what would happen to them if she got the role and if that's not love, I don't know what is.   

While I know some people hated the ending, and it is quite bittersweet, I actually found it quite refreshing. Though it was sad that they didn't end up together and I found their love story to be one of the most compelling I've ever seen, I realized, neither of them would have gotten what they truly wanted if they stayed together. It showed in the alternate reality that Seb wouldn't own a club and would instead have been still sitting with Mia watching somebody else live out his dream while Mia would still be struggling. I think it shows they needed each other to push each other and have somebody to lean on but, once they each found steady footing that initial need was lost. I think it's a great message that even though a relationship may not last, it doesn't mean you should regret it or that you never needed each other. Neither of them would have gotten where they ended up without each other, they were both just a very important part of each other's bigger story. Do I go back for the third time in 4 days? Am I the only one who thought it ran so smoothly by not having polished vocalists. I love musicals, but It felt more realstic this way. Almost like they were both talking, having a nice moment and all.. tough to explain, but hopefully some understand.

Edit: Another thing, like 'Whiplash' almost everything in the film is a character.. - background, visuals, music, camera, costumes, editing, symbolism etc. I love that tbh. That shot in the pool blew my mind.  When Sebastian started going off the list when he was supposed to be playing Christmas carols all I could hear was JK Simmons yelling ""Not my tempo"" I just wanna talk about one thing in the movie that astounded me. I mean the cinematography and use of colour and lighting was astounding and I loved both the leads. But Stones performance in the audition was single handedly one of the most incredible moments I have ever seen.

There will inevitably be comparisons between Hatheway in Les Mis but when I saw the Mia sing about her aunt in France I felt the exact same way I did when I heard 'I Dreamed a Dream':

I believed it.

I believed every line. Every note. And was just spellbound by the sheer fire in her eyes as she sang. I believed how much she wanted to grasp that dream by both hands. I related to it and I wanted it to end with something to smile about. 

It was the most passionate moment of the film and it made my heart soar. I love the ending and the fast forward 'what ifs' - it's like you always hear people say, 'it's life, not a movie' but now even the movie is not 'the movie'.

Pretty picture, color - all that neon and pink purpleish sky.  Saw this a couple of weeks ago, but just came to this thread because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. Loved it for all of the reasons that people are talking about, but feel like there is something important that needs to be added:

I feel like many people who are artists or residents of California/Los Angeles that are claiming La La Land as ""their movie"". This movie isn't just for those people. Anyone who has had to struggle in their career for having to decide between passion and practicality will be able to deeply relate to this movie. Anyone who has had their career affect their relationship will be able to deeply relate to this movie.

The experiences in this movie are not limited to artists or Californians, it is portraying a common, universal experience in the setting of Los Angeles. So many different types of people are able to empathize with the characters on such a deep, intimate level, and that is why this movie has blown up so much, and deservedly so.

To pigeonhole this movie into being exclusively for actors, musicians, and artists is simply wrong, and a disservice to the movie. What I love about Damien Chazelle in this movie is how often he lets the camera linger on Emma Stone/Ryan Gosling's faces. From Mia's tearful audition performance, to Seb's sellout photoshoot, Damien really lets the actors simply perform. 

This movie was beautiful. The score carried it behind the amazing cinematography. Never been quite a fan of Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling and I didn't even know Damien was behind this movie, but wow. What a movie. 

EDIT - FYI, the complete musical is on Spotify. Give it a listen. It's like watching the movie with your ears.  One of my favourite parts of the movie was the shot of the mould ceiling. Nothing shows reality setting in like a mouldy ceiling.  This Film made me think about my dreams really hard, things i want to achieve. Now that is very powerful. Film is great ! Loved it ! What if La La Land is a sequel to Whiplash, it's another way of using Jazz as a vessel to tell people to pursue their dream. And because [J.K. Simmons got fired from Shaffer Conservatory and so he decided to go to LA and open a restaurant and does anything but Jazz]  Late to the party- just saw it this afternoon. I'm a musician and performing artist, and there was so much in this movie about being an artist and performer that really hit me hard. Things like when Mia wants to quit acting because of all of the rejection and ""it hurts a little too much"" or Seb selling out... that photo shoot scene OMG. How jazz music is dying, and what are we going to do about it. When he's hired to plunk out Christmas tunes for tips but all you want to do is use your talents to express yourself. Oh, and the instant John Legend used the word ""TOUR"", I was like, welp that's it for Mia & Seb. Gosh. If this doesn't win best picture, I just won't know what to believe in any more.  With Whiplash and this, Damien Chazelle can't possibly keep this up with his next film, can he? Seriously, I am going to see anything with his name on it for a long time. Although it is interesting that this film and Whiplash have very similar themes: You have to sacrifice everything you have to realize your dreams. I think it's cool that with this same idea, he made two very different movies, one tense, thriller in a way, and then the other a romantic, melancholy musical. 

And this soundtrack is so good I can't stop listening to it. The dancing section of ""A Lovely night"" is so great.  I was totally charmed by La La Land but my overall feeling is SADNESS. I think that was a really sad movie. Even from the first scene - yeah the dreamers are dancing around full of hope - but really the lyrics are talking about these dreams and what it costs to have them - and even the song has a dark quality, a sadness. So all the way through Mia and Sebs's theme music winds its way through the movie - and it's sad and reminds us of what are we giving up to follow our dreams? And is it worth it? AND I ain't buying the ending where they give each other a little smile as if to say 'yeah, it's cool'. No way are either of them cool with the situation. What about Mia's husband? Zero chemistry with him -  so she's got her acting dream but not her happily ever after dream. And he's GUTTED she has walked in - and he plays that damn song again and I've gotta ask - was it worth it Seb?  Did anyone else cry during [Emma's singing to the auditioners who asked her to tell a story?](#spoiler) When she started to sing loudly I started tearing up like crazy. For some reason that buildup up emotions leading into that really makes me value the emotional expression enough to bring me to tears. Maybe I'm crazy. Just watched this earlier today, the ending was just so harrowingly beautiful but so real. Most of us have the one that got away and it lives with you. I felt like the entire film had an undertone of sadness which almost primes you for the devastation at the end end. 

I will be watching this again and again. Possibly my new favourite film! didn't think I'd like the movie. Hated the opening scene. Stuck with it and loved it. Emma Stone was outstanding and the scene at the end was really well done. Highly recommend this movie. Admittedly, I am not a fan of musicals. It's not that there's anything inherently wrong with them &amp;amp;amp; I appreciate the talent involved, I just personally have never cared for them. Never been able to find one that I truly enjoyed.

Until now.

What a great movie. Emma Stone was great but I thought Gosling was even greater. The movie was a perfect blend of musical, romance, drama, and ample dose of comedy (mostly coming from Gosling). Cinematography was on point. Only two things I truly didn't care for: the opening traffic jam sequence was... Eh, I dunno. Kind of unnecessary, and even more so being made to look like one take felt a little gimmicky. Also the part in the observatory where they literally float upwards and share a short dance in the cosmos. The entire movie has a whimsical, dreamy quality that still stays grounded in the surrealism to a point, but this small sequence felt too hokey in comparison. Honestly I wish they would've just done a musical number around the observatory floor or something.

But those are small gripes in comparison to how great everything else was. Stone has a much better voice than I would have anticipated; Gosling's kind of pales in comparison but it ironically works because, after all, he's a jazz piano player, not a singer. It's almost part of the charm.

I really liked the choice to NOT have them end up together because if they DID end up together, it would've been way too premeditated and cliché. Instead we have a fantastically bittersweet flashback ""what-could-have-been"" sequence that plants a solemn pit in your stomach and gives the finale an intangible melancholic quality. La La Land is by far one of the most beautiful, inspiring, and emotional films I have ever seen. Damien Chazelle is a pure genius in the filmmaking industry. It is a musical for all people of all ages and backgrounds. We can all connect to it. Every single component of it, from the music to the cinematography, overflows me with joy. I saw this movie the week after it came out and I still cannot stop thinking about it. I want to see it over and over and over again. [The ""old school Hollywood"" vibe is so unique to modern day movies today. The plot is such a roller coaster. **AND THE ENDING.** During the last fifteen minutes during the epilogue, my mouth was wide open, tears were flowing down my cheeks, and I was sinking further in my chair. But without this emotional ending, the movie would not have been the same. The music is BEAUTIFUL. I listen to it nonstop. It's so natural and raw yet dreamy. The cinematography is so detailed and every shot was chosen for a reason. *Especially* the first scene when it was taken with one camera. I still haven't gotten over that. The costumes are so colorful. Everything in the movie happened for a reason. Every decision was made with such detail and purpose.] (#spoiler)

When I was watching this movie, I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. I felt like in Los Angeles with Sebastian and Mia living with them. It is an experience, and it's the best experience I've ever had while watching a film in a theater. Period. I have not stopped thinking and talking about this movie for weeks. I am forever inspired by this beautiful movie. I would do absolutely anything to meet Damien Chazelle and tell him how much I genuinely appreciate his work. I have never felt this way about a movie before and I will always remember it. My fav quote was [""How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist?""](#spoiler) WTF?  Basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the next person to see a racial objection to La La Land.

He's not saying the film needs more blacks.  But he objects to Sebastian, the white guy, being the one to defend traditional jazz while the black guy is trying to revolutionize it.  

Kareem's remarks...

""The white guy wants to preserve the black roots of jazz while the black guy is the sellout? This could be a deliberate ironic twist, but if it is, it’s a distasteful one for African-Americans""

If anything, it's Kareem who's making an ironic, borderline-racist remark by assuming all black people think alike and aren't interested with artistic experimentation. I just saw this movie yesterday and, Oh, the sadness! But the more I think about it, it feels like Sebastian represents Old Hollywood and Mia represents New Hollywood. His quote: [""In Los Angeles, we worship everything and value nothing"" feels like it sums up the whole film for me.](#spoiler)

Mia worshipped Seb, but didn't value him. She valued her career and ambition over his love for her. The scene when he looks at the water stain on the ceiling is so significant... [He valued her more than his dream. He signed the contract to play in Keith's band so that he could make a home for them.](#spoiler) 

She drives a Prius and he drives a beater. He loves the old jazz club (now a Samba/Tapas bar) and he's seen Rebel Without a Cause (she hasn't). [When she drives by the Rialto again later in the film, it has a ""Closed"" sign across the marquee.](#spoiler) 

I think the ending is so heartbreaking because his love was so pure, so old fashioned, and hers wasn't. She's an actress and just like LA is glossy and shiny, but lacks substance underneath. 

Jazz is dying. Love like Seb's is dying. Real, true depth isn't valued like it used to be.  Just got out of seeing it about an hour ago.
My thoughts in no real order:

This felt so refreshing! I can't think of the last time I saw something like this if not purposely watching classic films. I think La La Land makes for a great reintroduction to this generation. 

I loved how they were able to perfectly balance this genre with modern times. As a viewer not used to this, at first, it was a little odd to see them break into singing and dancing but, as the movie went on, I was looking forward to it. 

The colors! Colors were the weapon in this movie and they were well implemented here. 

Emma Stone completely knocked it out of the park! She had me tear up a little during the audition when she's singing about her aunt. Emma Stone completely deserves any awards coming her way. While Gosling, it shows he put in the hard work for this role, his character still felt like usual witty charming Gosling we know (and love) from other films aside from Drive. 

I'm still feeling great from seeing this film! It really inspired me. I'm glad I finally got to see it. I'm glad a discussion is up to talk about it, and it really was everything I was hoping for. This is why I go to the cinemas, movies like this. Second favorite movie this year, next to Moonlight and The Lobster.

Edit: Wording  It's absolutely beautiful. Legitimately one of the best films I have ever seen. You need to watch it I immediately knew I'd like the movie the second the following was said:

[Lady: ""I got you a throw rug.""
Seb: ""I don't need that.""
Lady: ""What if I said Miles Davis pissed on it.""
Seb: ""It's almost insulting... Is it true??""](#spoiler) Man I'm usually the action/science fiction film type of guy but this movie really got to me. Makes me motivated to find a girl that's actually supportive of my goals, but scares me away just from the thought that I everything I built up with a person can just go all to waste.

Such an emotionally powerful movie so I'm kind of questioning some of my decisions I made in the past few years. The second song, Someone In The Crowd was probably my favorite visually. The opening number was fantastic, but the way the camera was spinning in the water bobbing up/down was absolutely crazy, I have NO idea how they managed to pull that off.

The movie was a blast, I haven't been swept away in a cinema like that in a very long time. Some very magical filmmaking on display by Chazelle.

EDIT: For those interested, [I found out how they managed to pull off the spinning camera pool scene, thanks to some great behind the scenes footage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhDtuy-YG74) To sum it up in one single sentence: La La Land made me love life again.

I can't remember the last time a movie made me this emotional since forever. I didn't cry but only because I sat next to total strangers. This film is cinematic perfection. Its art and entertainment at the same time. Everything comes together perfectly.

Audition is probably the one song that speaks to me on so many levels and to others as well. I mean, just read my username. 

The film ended an hour ago and I might cry any moment now. What a film. What an experience.  I'm going to say something that will surely get me downvoted. 

I ultimately liked the movie, but certain elements rubbed me the wrong way. 

* Ryan Gosling's character is passionate about a only specific time period of jazz. He's a jazz hipster. His discomfort when John Legend's band starts playing synthesizers in their first rehearsal is irritating. Even Miles Davis experimented with distortion and a wah-wah peddle on the Live-Evil album. (If you haven't heard it, look it up) 

* Neither character is defined by much more than their artistic ambitions. I don't know much about who Mia is, aside from her dreams of being a great actress like her aunt.  Even the grand conflict of the third act is centered around whether or not she'll give up her dreams. 

* The movie is a wish-fulfillment, struggling artist fairytale. This is never more explicit than it is in the third act. Mia is heartbroken because nobody came to and/or liked her show, so she gives up and moves home. But her moment of crisis is resolved because it turns out that a casting director was there, and she wants to give Mia an audition for a project that ""has no script and will be built around the actress.""

The film is gorgeous, and the epilogue specifically is utterly charming. 

But I didn't love it the way i had hoped I would. 

Of the three big ""best picture"" contenders this year, **La La Land** is likely my least favorite. 

 Loved it, like the rest of you.  A couple of points of thoughts I had after leaving the movie:

**Mia's cell phone**:  She seems to not be very attached to her cell phone at all, which I found to be a cool character trait for a 21st century movie.   

At first I thought it was a bit of a plot device.

* she forgets about her audition

* she never asks Sebastian for his number

* she isn't able to text/call Sebastian to cancel the movie. 

But then she *leaves her phone at home* when she goes back to Nevada.  This would be entirely unthinkable to me.  I feel like it kind of shows how caught up in the magic she actually is.  My friend thought that the casting director called Sebastian's phone looking for her, but I don't think this is the case, because he drives all the way to Nevada without calling her instead.  

**Keith** (John Legend):  We know that there's a bit of animosity between him and Sebastian, and I initially thought that he was maybe the guy who ripped him off.  This clearly isn't the case, but they make a point for us to know that there is some begrudged past between the two characters.  The easy interpretation is that they represent old vs. new jazz, but does anyone think there might be a bit more depth to it? Primary colors! Primary colors and green are abound in this film. One thing I could say about Damian Chazelle's ""La La Land"" is that it is vivid. ""La La Land"" is about the relationship of two L.A. artists, Sebastian (Ryan Goslin) and Mia (Emma Stone), as they navigate through their careers. Chazelle tells this story through the use of musical scores, ""seasonal transitions"" (it's L.A.), and visual bliss. The audience sees how the characters feel. Sebastian and Mia's time at the observatory is an example of good visual storytelling. Both Ryan Goslin and Emma Stone are amazing in their roles. Their portrayal is very convincing and makes the audience care for their characters and their relationship. However, the music, which is a character itself in the film, really drives the film. Chazelle is no doubt a fan of Jazz, and he uses the genre to build and end Sebastian and Mia's relationship. The ending is very impactful. It highlights both Sebastian and Mia's desires to be with one another while acknowledging the price they paid for success. It is my belief that the title, ""La La Land,"" stems from the final scene. 

Overall, ""La La Land"" is a film that needs to be seen on either the biggest screen or 4K capable television set. It uses Jazz to tell a colorful story about two LA artists tied between their relationship and their careers. The ending is very effective, and the movie's cast is great. Again, I highly recommend this film be seen in theatres. 

 Just saw it with my mom and sister.
Holy shit man, like holy shit is this movie a masterpiece.
I watched so many movies in the last 2 months that I was bored going to the theater this time, but extremely excited because my cousin hyped it up. I promise you that this movie will make your jaw drop, makes you smile earloop to earloop . finally got this movie in my city and was able to see it last night. Whiplash is in my top 5 movies of all time so I was absolutely dying waiting to see this and I thought Damien Chazelle came through again with this. the music was beautiful and flowed well through the movie. the story wasn't revolutionary or anything but it didn't need to be Gosling and Stone had such great chemistry that it worked so well. but the Cinematography and the Choreography was what stole the show. this movie was absolutely gorgeous.

Some scenes that I loved that I haven't seen people talk much about include Sebastian walking Mia to her car after the party and then you realize his car was at the house the whole time and he walked with her just to talk, really loved that detail. Sebastian and Mia in the movie theater when their hands touch and they start to lean in to kiss, I think this scene was fantastic because a lot of people can relate to that feeling and wanting to be in that same situation it was really well done and I enjoyed how slow they took it. I also thought the movie was really funny and the biggest laugh from me was when Seb thought Mia blew him off at her parents house in Nevada so he drives away right as she reaches for the door, Goslings quick little ""yeah for sure"" when Mia explains she got coffee was hilarious and reminded me of how goofy and clueless his character was in the Nice Guys.

and of course the scenes that everyone have been talking about were fantastic. the opening sequence was incredibly impressive and just awesome to start off with. the Observatory scene was beautiful and emotional and fun to see. but holy shit that ending sequence. as someone who wants to leave his hometown to work on his dream career but is afraid to move away and give up a ""normal life"" in pursuit of a dream, this scene fucked me up. seeing the alternate reality of what could have been and if they both could have been happy with that other life was so sad. I'm just glad that the movie ended with both Seb and Mia smiling to each other. they had to sacrifice their relationship in order to achieve their original dreams before each other and I don't know if it was necessarily worth it to them but I think they're both proud and happy for each other, which matters I think.

loved the movie so much. so happy for Damien Chazelle who has now made two amazing movies in my opinion Anyone notice in the first third or maybe half of the movie, Mia was dressed in a spectrum of colors, blue, yellow, green, red. When things got serious, it was pretty much black and white, except for the blue top in Audition.  I loved it.

I want to talk briefly about the ending. We see the ideal perfect fantasy life that could have been. Seb doesn't sell out by joining the Messengers and signing that deal with Keith, he makes it to her one woman show, goes with her to Paris, etc.

And the saddest part of all to me was that even in this fantasy when they get back to LA, the club still exists. Someone else shared his dream for a revitalized jazz club where Samba and Tapas were -- he didn't *have* to stay/go on tour/follow that particular dream, because someone else would have done it anyways. He makes these sacrifices so he can one day bring jazz back to that club, and it turns out it would have come back if he'd even given up nothing at all. Just saw this last night. This film blew me away! It exceeded my expectations. This is an instant classic. Damien Chazelle crafted a cinematic masterpiece. I can't wait to watch this numerous more times. The music is stuck in my head. Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone had great chemistry on-screen and perfected their roles. I expect this film to win in so many of the categories it's nominated for at the Oscars.  Fuuuuck why didn't they get back together? I wanted a happy ending. ;( I really liked how they handled her dresses, blue yellow green red and it ends with black and white. I dunno why but it made so much sense that she'd have a progression like their lives had. 

What an outstanding movie, this is Grand Budapest Hotel kind of movie for me, they speak to us in their particular manner that no other movie can, loved it  **[Contains Spoilers - Please don't read further if you haven't seen the movie]**

I couldn't help but to have a bittersweet feeling about the movie. While it seems like Sebastian and Mia are soul mates that should end up together at the end, they don't. More specifically, it seemed like Mia's decision to marry and start a family with another man was one of innocence, of inevitability, of public acceptance as queued by Sebastian's lonesome smile at the end of the movie despite the fact that they had both expressed their love for each other. It was hard for me to stomach that ending as well as people's full acceptance of it. Let me provide further context.

**This is my thinking-**

Sebastian and Mia helped each other pursue each other's dreams - for Sebastian, it was resurrecting traditional jazz by opening his own jazz club. For Mia, it was telling stories in her unique way as an actress. Along the way, they fell in love with each other's held passion toward achieving their respective dreams. 

This relationship development in the movie leads the viewers to want to believe that their mutual love for each other's passion as well as their mutual trust shown through vulnerability create a strong enough pull for both of them to stick together through any obstacle and ultimately end up together at the end of the movie. Sebastian even sacrificed his dream (temporarily) and relationship *for Mia's good, not his* - what selfless acts of love! Shouldn't this kind of love continue and endure in marriage?

Not in La La Land. The pull was indeed strong enough for Sebastian (as evidenced by the dedication of his club to Mia by naming it ""Seb's"" - Mia's recommendation that Seb took out of his trust and love for Mia), but it wasn't strong enough for Mia (she ends up marrying another man). 

In the end, viewers are left in a melancholic mood because they realize that the eternal love they verbally and mutually expressed to each other (""I'll always love you"") didn't come to fruition.

This kind of story is reality for so many people - the kind of story where lovers part because the pull wasn't strong enough for one or both parties to hold on to their love throughout the passing seasons of life. I too had feelings of melancholy toward this kind of story and I was especially empathetic towards Sebastian - I know what it's like to feel empty, betrayed almost, to witness a loved one with another man after hearing the words, ""I'll always love you"" from them. 

**So I was left helplessly and indignantly asking the following questions:**

* (1) Are people's capabilities of loving another person that weak?

* (2) Which qualities of Sebastian would have prompted a strong enough pull for Mia to reserve her devotion to Sebastian until they meet again?

* (3) Was Mia's marrying another person inevitable in the five years she spent apart from Sebastian?
	
* (3a) Was there something selfless or loving in a person's power that *could've* been done to keep her eternal love for him?

* (3b) Was there something selfless or loving in a person's power that *should've* been done to keep her eternal love for him?

* (4) Which factors could have enabled Sebastian's and Mia's relationship to continue?

**The following is my attempt at answering my questions, which I hope will help me and you avoid an unnecessary heartbreak that Sebastian experienced at the end of the movie upon seeing Mia:**

* (1) Yes, they are weak because the human heart is fickle. The object of human love (as in the qualities people think they need in their partner) changes so frequently because we are unsure of what we really need. It might be inspiration in one season and accountability in another. For Mia, it may have solely been inspiration radiating out of Sebastian's passion in one season and (maybe) maturity to lead her and her future children in another season. Because the object of our love changes so frequently, the duration of love for a particular object or a person can be short and capability to love, weak. 

* (2) In order to answer this question, I need to factor in the variable of Mia's changing needs with time. If Sebastian had and showed to Mia the different qualities she needed in the different seasons of her life, I believe she would have been devoted to marrying Sebastian at the end despite the time she spent away from him.

* (3) Yes, it was inevitable if her inner most need changed in the five years, and if she saw that she was able to fulfill that new inner most need with another man.

* (3a) If it was necessary that her needs change as she grows as a person, then may be just one - have faith that Sebastian will have the new qualities she is looking for in her husband. Anything other than that such as calling Sebastian, moving back to LA, etc. would have prevented Sebastian from fully devoting himself to achieving his dream. While having faith could have been a selfless act, it would not have been the most wise act since Sebastian might not have actually had them and she could have missed the opportunity to find a new partner with those qualities during that time.

* (3b) Perhaps, not actively look for another partner (but still be open to the possibility of pursuing a relationship with another partner if that partner, with qualities she most needs, appears). I'm not saying Mia did actively look btw.

* (4) Many things - I'll only touch on three that I think are most important:
	
* (4a) Unchanging inner most needs - I think this is possible only when a person has fairly matured, perhaps after they have realized that satisfaction gained from attaining worldly pursuits and obsessions, (for Sebastian and Mia, it was their dream) fades away. This factor would not have been possible to add to the movie since both of them at the point of their separation were still, to a certain degree, obsessed with achieving their dreams, (""obsession is a young man's game"") but it's worth to mention it here for the sake of helping readers make wise calls when it comes to deciding when to seriously start dating.

* (4b) Location of Mia's job - proximity to one another could have been fuel for helping keep each other's commitment to always loving one another.

* (4c) Mia's continuing of dreaming for different things in the spirit of her relationship with Sebastian. I can say this only because I'm assuming that Mia's wants, needs and dreams changed while she was separated with Sebastian. If, however, Mia dreamt new dreams that she thinks Sebastian could help her achieve or that Sebastian could similarly dream, she might have been less prone to marrying another man, let alone consider seriously dating another man.

Assuming the truth of these answers (especially the answer to question #4) has helped me overcome the melancholic feeling that the movie and other similar true stories have left me with as well as stomach the ending. It did so by helping me realize that Sebastian and Mia, with their scintillating chemistry, could have been the one for each other under a different set of circumstances…

* Had they met toward the finish line of achieving their dreams of youth (instead of during a time where they were training for their race), they would have ended up together, still being able to spur each other on and inspire each other to achieve their dreams. 

* Had Mia's job been in LA (even if they still decided to end the relationship while working in the same city), they would've had a better chance of ending up together since Mia would need to look no further than Sebastian if her needs had changed while training and working as an actress). 

* Had Mia and Sebastian possessed a unifying theme from their dreams such as expressing themselves through art to the same demographic, or serving the needs of the same group or classification of people, they might have been willing to continue their relationship despite the time it might take away from their working towards achieving their dreams because spending time with each other indirectly or directly helps them achieve their dreams. 
		
Thinking this way helped me not only empathize with the characters in the movie, but also pity them and their situation. Falling in love under the circumstances that the movie has established is so inevitable. Who wouldn't fall in love with a quirky and adorable character of Mia or a captivating and passionate character of Sebastian when you're facing hardships of a similar kind? Spending time together with a person like that also builds camaraderie which also doesn't help you refrain from falling in love with that person. At the same time, I now know that, if I were Sebastian, getting over Mia after the separation might've saved a devastating heart break - the kind I think Sebastian experienced at the end (I thought the lonesome-starting/ending single-note melodies of Sebastian's piano song at the end of the movie portrayed his heartbreak).

All of this goes to say that deciding to seriously date a person you might be attracted to might better work out (assuming the scintillating chemistry - one of Sebastian and Mia - is already there) if you guys...

* have complimentary goals
* are flexible or are planning to live near each other during each other's respective pursuits of dreams 
* think you have seen and found qualities in each other that would meet the unknowable changing needs of your future *(this applies only if facing geographical separation and maturely breaking up the relationship like Mia and Sebastian did in the movie)* 

The presence of the third point will help you become less romantically distracted by other people, increasing the chance for each other keep each other's devoted love for each other until the next meeting. I believe these are the circumstantial qualities that will be a strong enough pull that would enable your inner Sebastian and your inner Mia to come together and stay together in marriage at the end.

Let me know your thoughts!
 On my third rewatch, I noticed something interesting: Mia turns off a lamp at the end of her play. She does this when she performs it for the first time in her bedroom for Sebastian, and on the night of the actual performance. However, in the final dream sequence, Mia leaves the lamp on.

Now, here's the significance behind this. Consider the title of Mia's play - ""So Long, Boulder City"". Based on what we know about Mia, it can be presumed that the play is a reflection of her life (leaving home to pursue her passion for acting in Hollywood).
Going off of this, I believe that Mia turning off the lamp at the end of her play is symbolic of her doubts that she is meant to succeed as an actress, which foreshadows her move back home (note that Mia's interaction with the lamp is the only part of her play that we see in the movie).

The evidence to support this comes in the dream sequence, which imagines what might have happened between Mia and Sebastian, had their relationship worked out perfectly. It is in this perfect world, where Mia does not doubt herself, and her acting dreams. Therefore, the play she writes that is based on her life, is a play based on this perfect world.

And it is in this perfect world, rather than turn the lamp off, Mia keeps it on. I could watch this over and over again.  This movie is why going to the movies used to be fun. It's been a long time since I loved a film as much as this one. Why this movie has a perfect ending

Some of the people who I've talked to about this movie have told me that they didn't enjoy the ending, simply because [Mia and Seb don't end up together. I found the juxtaposition of the scenes five years later showing a successful Mia and her husband and Seb in his club with those of ""what could have been"" satisfied both the part of me that wanted their love to triumph and the part of me that wanted them both to be successful in achieving their dreams. This film is one that shows the tug of war between love and success, one that exposes the happy and sad realities of life, even through a fantastical lens. What I loved so much about the ending was the way that the shared ""fantasy"" gave us as audience members not a perfect ""Hollywood Ending"", but rather an alternate and just as plausible reality, one in which Mia and Sebastian stay in love and stay together, but cannot succeed in following their dreams. Mia doesn't become wildly famous as an actress, as evidenced through the smaller home and suburban life, and Seb can't open his club, shown by the mere fact that it is a different man sitting at the piano when Mia and Sebastian enter the club in the last few seconds of the ""fantasy"". This gives us as the audience the ability to make the same choice that Mia and Sebastian do, to embrace the ending of both characters achieving their dreams at the expense of love, or enjoy the fantasy in which the two can be together, without their greatest aspirations coming to fruition. Chazelle sets up this almost choice by presenting the two contrasting yet parallel realities to create an ending that is for an audience member ""conflict and compromise and very very exciting"" (Not sure if I got that quote right). The ending makes us feel as conflicted, excited, and forced to compromise as Mia and Sebastian are when we decide which fate is better, a theme emblematic of the entire film.](#spoiler) I've just got out the cinema and I'm totally captivated by the whole thing. The soundtrack to the palette, the cinematography, everything. Stone and Gosling were just incredible. I'm lost for words at how amazing this film is. 
As cheesy and as typical as it sounds, no one makes films like this anymore. 
The scene in which they're in the museum and they fly to the sky, truly captivated me, made me think back to how the old films used to be before all the serious CGI. 
That smile between the two stars!!! That got me. Emotion wreck sat over here in the back seat. 
Best ending, leaves so many things un- answered, but don't all the best films do that????

10/10 I was basically crying for this entire movie.  There were so many beautiful moments. I hated the into scene so it started off on the wrong foot for me, and I thought I was going to hate the movie.  The moment I realized I loved it was when Seb was playing in the restaurant and you could really feel how much he truly loved music.   (#spoiler)
Its a good rainy saturday movie! 
Kind of felt sad in the ending for ryan though! 
I just dont get it, why they parted ways! Why! I'm super late to this thread but I wanted to add my 2 cents too. I loved the transition between nostalgia and modern times. After Mia (in yellow) and Sebastian finish singing after the spring party, her phone rings. That contrast was lovely!  Just watched the movie and this will be a spoiler so here I go.

The ending is just brutally real! People want to debate whether it's happy or sad but in my opinion this was a love story just gone wrong. Ita bittersweet in the fact that they both achieved their dreams but at the cost of their own love. The ending was tragic and just not just because they didn't fall in love but the fact that they both looked miserable. The last look was just an indicator that ""well this sucks but it's how it's going to be"". I don't know I just didn't really like the ending. They should have made him be just a tad bit more of an asshole. 

A good change that would have made the ending make more since is when Sebastian takes Mia to do her final audition before making it big he should have gotten a call from his band for a prior arrangment and would not have been there when she nailed the role. This would have better transitioned into acceptance from the viewer that the couple not picking back up in there relationship was the right call.
 Beautiful movie. Definitely worth the wait for me. I'm going to be dragging my friends who don't even like musicals to this one, because even if you don't enjoy the song and dance, I don't think that you can deny how incredible some of those sequences were. The ending alone was absolutely breathtaking, from a visual standpoint. The use of colors and light in this movie were just unreal. (Like, why was it so great that the four girls were wearing red, green, blue, and yellow dresses at the very beginning?) 

I didn't actually end up crying, but the ending and surprisingly Mia's audition brought me very, very close. I echo the sentiment of some of the other people on here, as well. Miles Teller would have been just awful in the leading role. I don't see him as being nearly as likable as Gosling, and with his characterization, he has to be likable for the movie to be tolerable. I also think that there was a noticeable lack of music in the second half, but it didn't bother me too much.

The entire thing was very nostalgic, but to me it never felt too heavy-handed or pandering. This may be a controversial thing to say on this sub, but I partially agree with some reviewers who say that the whole thing is awkward for never addressing the racial aspect of jazz. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the movie is racist, but I certainly see where that complaint comes from.  Unfortunately, when you make a movie that's meant to capture the nostalgic feeling of old Hollywood, you're going to run into some of old Hollywood's pitfalls, too. 

All in all, this is a movie that I think is worth seeing just for how it *looks*. Very pretty and very well put together flick.  Wow, favorite movie of the year. My previous favorite was *The Nice Guys*, which also stars Ryan Gosling. 

* Cinematography was absolutely lights out, every shot was composed beautifully and felt well thought out. That opening scene was fucking fantastic, and so was the second musical number with Mia’s roommates. 

* Acting was good, Emma & Ryan's chemistry and charm, seen already in *Crazy, Stupid, Love*, is abundant. They did reasonably well with the singing considering they're actors first. It seemed like they had way less lines than the usual movie, but they did a great job conveying emotion without talking. Apparently Gosling actually spent a lot of time learning piano for this, which, as a piano player, is pretty legit. 

* I’m not a big on musicals, I’m watching a show right now (*Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*) and I feel like the songs don't add enough to be worthwhile, but I thought this was a great movie for people who share similarly lukewarm sentiments. The second the movie started, any reservations I had about the film were gone. 
I **loved** the soundtrack, first thing I did when I got out of the theatre was look it up and download it. I found myself smiling whenever their theme song came on in it’s various renditions, and there wasn’t so much singing that it distracted from the story. 

Other thoughts:

* The anachronism took me out of the moment, especially in the beginning, like seeing all the old cars, then she has a Prius, or her iPhone. Reminded me of Archer where you don’t know what decade they're in. 

* I have mixed feelings about the ending. I thought it did a decent job of conveying the theme of making hard sacrifices for your dream, and it feels especially relevant in this generation, with increasingly more young professionals & entrepreneurs (especially women) becoming career-oriented. On the other hand, I feel like movies are actively trying to avoid the ""Hollywood ending"", which isn't a bad thing, but I would've preferred the happy ending this time. It also rings a little hollow, because there’s an overwhelming amount of people (especially the creative types in LA) who will never experience Seb/Mia's storybook success.

* As someone who lives in LA, the movie left me with a bittersweet feeling. There’s still that palpable sense of wonder and opportunity, and I’ll definitely be re-visiting all of the filming locations. But a) traffic is soul-sucking and b) the gentrification and development of the city makes it hard to actually experience LA like a movie. Seb's line about ""It's LA, where people worship everything, but value nothing” sounded a bit too edgy, but the sentiment is true. And I’m saying this as someone who's bougie as fuck and loves modern development lol.

Overall: 9/10, definitely see this and be ready for the feels. I just saw this and (with the exception of maybe Arrival) it was probably the best film I've seen in a theater for years. I was blown away by the sheer spectacle of the musical numbers while simultaneously thinking ""how in the hell did they film that?"" and they did an amazing job bringing these moments back down to earth (literally in one scene) to give the story a sense of reality. After Whiplash and now this I honestly consider Damien Chazelle the best filmmaker of his generation, seriously there were long takes in this to make Inarritu and Cuaron envious and he's still really young. Saying that I still found the ending a little bit of a downer in that although the theme of the film is about persuing your dreams the relationship between Seb and Mia felt more genuine than that and their break up seemed a little forced in order to create the melancholy ending (seriously could they not have just skyped each other for a few months?). Also a small thing I loved that I don't see mentioned yet was the forth wall breaking discussion regarding how bad movies theater's are. One of the best movies I've ever seen.

It was really of its time, a truly 2016 film.  It presented the baroque musical drama and the theatrics and the love without ever committing itself to it, always parodying it immediately afterwards.  There was always still a kernel of authenticity to the dream.  Absolutely refreshing and moving I can't get over this movie. I woke up with City of Stars in my head. I don't even know how to properly express the impression it left on me. It was just magical from start to finish.  So I thought the whole time that the title ""La La Land"" simply referred to Hollywood. A place where romantics chase their dreams. 

But it also referred to the ending. A fantasy where they both get everything they wanted including each other. The final sequence literally took us off to La La Land  Saw it for the first time today, I absolutely loved this movie. I almost burst into tears when she sang the Audition song, and the last bit in the movie also made me a fair bit emotional. Also Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were better than I expected when it came to the singing, which is a plus.

Although, I did go 'wait what' when she claimed that she wasn't as pretty. Like, hello? lmao. But yeah I loved this movie, and I'll definitely be recommending it to others. Finally saw it yesterday and it's just beautiful and bittersweet as can be. I'm super late seeing this but that ending crushed me. I guess it was realistic per se but I would've loved a happy ending. 

I'm seeing a lot of negative comments about the film which is interesting. While I feel it's possibly been overhyped and given people unrealistic expectations going into the film I really loved the story and the chemistry between Gosling and Stone. 

Sure the dancing and singing weren't anything to scream home about but the music was great and I felt the movie really connects with you on an emotional level. I don't care if it's a circlejerk at this point, this movie was best of the year and in my top 5 all time favorites. Good god, it's absolutely remarkable. They took a HUGE risk taking the film in the direction they did, but it was so tasteful and well done. They had SO may opportunities to cop out/sell out in story, music, or dialogue, but they stood firm with their vision until the end. I think a perfect example of this is [the ending. The final sequence in the club was so emotional and creative, and when she looked back, I was PRAYING she wouldn't run into his arms and confess her love. When she turned around after a warm smile, my heart just melted. If I wasn't on the verge of peeing myself due to refusing to leave the theater to visit the bathroom, I'd be sobbing in my seat for minutes on end.](#spoiler) 

The CHEMISTRY between Gosling and Stone is extraordinary to say the least. In many modern 'romance' films, the relationship feels plastic and unrealistic. While obviously exaggerated in some ways to maintain the feel of the film, their relationship was so believable and tangible. I am not going to lie, my faith in those actors had been slightly shaken the last few years, but this redeemed them entirely and then some.

I will say, however, that I wasn't a HUGE fan of the opening song. I remember looking over at my brother who sung it's praises for WEEKS and just raising my eyebrow in doubt and confusion. It felt (and I apologize for the use of this word, as it's a lazy and easy term) so millennial and unfitting with the rest of the film. I almost felt like they were going to try to sell me a Mazda or something. The second song was notably better but still a little too...I dunno, unremarkable? However, once the ending rolled around, I did develop quite an appreciation for the intro. The movie truly felt like it matured as the characters did, though I am not sure if this was intentional. I wouldn't put it past the incredible people behind this film.

All in all, this film is a rare masterpiece that I doubt we'll find again any time soon. It's a love letter to the Singing in the Rains and Holiday Inns that used to be a staple of the United States, as well as a tasteful rekindling of modern day romance films. I cannot praise this film enough. While I don't love conventional rating systems, this is an EASY 9.5/10, probably higher. Entered the theatre feeling happy, came out with tears caressing my cheeks as they poured past my porcelain skin. 
Affected me greatly, moved me deeply, it's been awhile since a film did this to me.
The tears testament to how good this film is, it struck me to the core, hit me hard. 
When I laughed at the humorous moments throughout the film, I roared.
When I felt happy from the uplifting, energetic scenes, I was overjoyed.
When I cried at the sad, heartfelt scenes, I wept as if the heartache and break, loss had been inflicted upon me. I cried so much, my lips puffed up and doubled in size like Angelina Jolie's, my green eyes became an abyss of vibrant emeralds and a headache with the beat of a pounding warhammer waged upon me (crying a lot gives me severe headaches).
Not only did I cry for the protagonist's loss of their true love and the flashbacks of their romanticised and fantasiced ""what if,"" but also for that sensitive performance of Emma Stone during Mia's audition. The sadness in her voice, along with the story told, I was revelling in a torrent of tears as the song and its woe spoke to me deeply. 
It made me feel. 
I felt and as I felt, I was living. As living is to feel and feeling is living. It reminded me I'm not dead inside, but I am ALIVE, not stone cold but alive with feeling and emotion. 

I am not one for musicals and I dislike soppy, corny love stories and romances. But for me, this film was done in a way that was neither soppy or corny. It was relateable and tasteful. None of those unnecessary rauncy, steamy window style, sandstorm, fuckstorm, fuck-me-hard-and-do-it-again scenes that makes you feel awkward when watching with other people such like family. It was simply implied in this film with more emphasis on the beauty of being in love, how magical it can make your plain world seem when you're arm in arm with that someone special. A tribute to how films used to be in the good ol' days (and no I am not old but 25), before movies became saturated with superficiality, lack of substance and depth with poor plot and story.
Such an elegant and emotive film. Beautiful, even despite the sad ending that'll haunt you like the ghost of your ex lover. Perhaps that's the genius of its beauty; The heartbreak you feel at the end.

Watching the film, I now understand why it's titled ""LaLa Land"".... It wasn't their dream careers that were lala land, it was the prospect of being one another's dearest, forever.
Just like a beautiful flower, the seasons changed and the winter came, 
And the beautiful flower was,
No more.

I couldn't understand why Mia just couldn't wait for Seb. It was only a space of 5 years and she already got married and had a daughter, along with establishing herself a successful acting career, becoming the proclaimed actress she dreamt of from the beginning. Fuck, she didn't waste time. Is all that even possible in 5 years??
And there's Seb, lingering behind, still stuck on her. 
I guess she never really forgave him enough for the harsh words he said to her when their relationship started to fray, to consider going back with him. She would've been better with him though, they were each other's true love, and he was talented and better looking than the old Colin Firth type she married.



I wonder where you are,
Somewhere distant and afar.
Did my dream come true?
Then why can't I find You?
Nowhere to be seen,
Only...when I 
dream. Unbelievable film... Something to point out that I adored (and apologies for paraphrasing the quotes) was how [their relationship began on chance and the tempting of fate (""we keep running in to each other... doesn't that mean something?""), but ended the same way (when they're sitting on the bench and decide to once again let chance take the reigns). It was showing how life *can* be serendipitous and romantic and ""just like the movies"", but it can also be indifferent and cruel, and as much as many rely on the mantra of ""everything happens for a reason"", our life choices **do** shape our path in a very concrete way.](#spoiler) Beautiful movie... Can't wait to see it again! Just saw it, I'm still trying not to cry. This movie really got to me. I loved it. Music in general means a lot to me, and I thought it was so well written/included in this film. I understand the choice of the ending, I felt it was very real- however I think I wanted to see the sappy happy Hollywood ending. 

But the film wouldn't have been as powerful if it didn't end that way. I really want to see it again so I can study it a bit more. Go see it. 

 One thing I noticed that none of my friends did was at the beginning when Sebastian took Mia to listen to some jazz at a bar, he told here that the problem with jazz is that it's being treated as background music now and not something to pay attention to. 
Well! After that moment in the film, I began to notice the jazz music playing throughout the film and it was always so distinctive when ever it was playing so you can really listen to it (which is what I think our clever director wanted to happen). But when Sebastian has gained his fame and went on tour, everytime the traditional jazz music played, it wasnt as distinctive and didnt stand out as much. And the day Seb comes home and makes a dinner for Mia, he puts on jazz music (AS BACKGROUND MUSIC) and when they have their fight scene, the jazz music is in the background, but you dont notice it. Which is what Seb said was the problem with jazz music now (that it's being played as background music only).

I just thought it was a cleaver hidden theme that was put into the film :)  did anyone notice how Sebastian couldn't finish the last note of the song in the end? How he was so slow and hesitant that the audience clapped thinking he was done. I looked it up to see if i'm right, but cannot find it anywhere. Did anyone else notice it or think my theory is right? I liked how in the Planetarium where they were optimistic about the future and their dreams they saw the galaxy projected on the roof, and then when Mia's on the phone with her mother and Sebastian's hit with the realism of his situation he stares at the stain on the roof of their place. The stain looks similar to the galaxy, except now it's plain and ugly. Just something cool I noticed. 

Also, at the end it sounds like the guy making the deal with Sebastian is saying 'Paris did a good job', but I think he might be saying '[The re]pairers did a good job'. [I just loved everything about this film; what I loved most was the whole ending segment and it's parallels to Casablanca. The idea of the song (Seb and Mia theme vs As Time Goes By) that brings them together to remember what they had (a la ""we'll always have Paris"") and even that final shot of Mia framed like Ilsa Lund. Just genius](#spoiler) where do i even start. fantastic film from start to finish.. but 1 i probably will never re-watch due to the ending. the feels for Sebastian im not used to in a movie. Give me my happy ending you mother f*ckers!! 
im off to cry for the remainder of the day now  I just feel so wrecked after watching La La Land,just watched it anf it was such a rollercoaster from the begining until the very end.The way the story is presented from both of their points of view is very clever and good,the ending was so damn heartbreaking,i can't put it into words,incredibly good movie I've been listening to the soundtrack since I saw it on Tuesday. I was really, really moved by this movie. It is my favorite movie I've seen in a long time. The colors, the acting, the music, the look and feel of LA. I adore all of it. The ending is beautiful and moving and like nothing I would have expected. It is as much a story about being ambitious and pursuing your dreams as it is about romance. Maybe even more so. The last ten minutes fucked me up. I didn't cry during the movie, but about two hours later I did when I was thinking about the ending. Both of them being happy for the other and what they've accomplished is just a beautiful sentiment. I hope this wins best picture. It was perfect to me.

Damien Chazelle is truly a unique and outstanding director with this and Whiplash under his belt, and Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are one of my favorite on screen pairings.  What a fantastic homage to the golden era of Hollywood. It was also an absolutely beautiful movie. This Damien Chazelle guy is going to be a force going forward [deleted] Thank god my family dragged me to this movie. As someone who doesn’t watch too many musicals there were a few things I really liked, they avoided the 2 minute dialogue that’s purely setting up the song and devoted real time to not singing. The reoccurring songs are catchy as hell, that’s the #1 quality for any musical. 

The way they play with retro vs modern was amazing, credit to set design and directing. They managed to make a film about 2016 people that feels like the 50’s, Gosling’s brown suit and car, the Jazz club and some of the dresses look like they’re from decades ago, but don’t feel out of place in the quasi-retro world they created. Making it 100% in the 50’s would have felt cheesy. 

Gosling and Stone don’t sound overly auto-tuned in their songs either, it’s obvious they practiced and sang it by themselves, it’s not pro-quality, but it’s good enough. Very impressed with this director, only 32 and doing visionary films like this. 
 I don't know what to say. Mind blowing. This is not only the best modern musical movie of all time (small category), but the best movie I've seen in a movie theater all year. Damien Chazelle is officially up there with Nolan and Fincher. This guy isn't fooling around with his long single take shots, and this one has them aplenty. Emma Stone is probably getting more than a nomination nod. Ryan Gosling was HILARIOUS. The movie is called La La Land, but it felt too real to me. Thank you.  I've never been huge on musicals, but wow, I really enjoyed the film, almost perfect. Though I don't understand the plot point of Mia insisting that Sebastian open his jazz club right then and there, especially given the fact he'd been given the opportunity to make a good salary. It seems like while they both help each other achieve their dreams, Mia had to constantly complicate things. Sebastian goes from tolerating his spot in the band to hating it based on the conversation the two had over dinner. What's worse about that, I feel like they were trying to make me sympathize with her more over Sebastian, while the opposite happened.   A very honest movie with very honest writing.  Ran at a good clip, loved the editing, cinematography and choreography.  Deserves the accolades. [The moment when she looked up at the PA Speaker to hear the song really got to me.](#spoiler) You know it was good when on the way back to the car you start dancing (more like *trying* to dance) with your wife.  Wow. Just wow.

Just got out of the theatre. That is a spectacular, and spectacularly beautiful film.

After moonlight, Manchester by the Sea, and Hell or high water I didn't think I'd see a better film this year, but La La Land is the best movie I've seen in a very very long time.

The music, the performances, the direction, the ***script***... 

Wow.    I've just watched the movie this afternoon. It was clearly a masterpiece, combined perfectly with retro-ish cinematography and wonderful use of music. I came to watch it with a blank mind how it would become and the moment I stepped out of the theatre, my mind was haunted by the accurate depiction of reality the movie brings in. Especially the last few scenes (epilogue), they will haunt me for quite a while as they hit so hard from home... I didn't see the trailer beforehand, so I didn't know exactly what to expect going in. I'm not big on musicals or romance, but that was one of the greatest theatre experiences of my life. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's chemistry is the best. Gonna have the music stuck in my head for the next few weeks now. I was absolutely left speechless and stunned when I left the theater, and for me that rarely happens.. Just...wow, my favorite movie this year and one of my favorite movies ever. Gosling and Stone nailed Seb and Mia, Damien Chazelle's a genius, and everything--cinematography, music, the story--was amazing.

And the ending got me shook. *Wow.*

10/10 I was dragged to this and was pissed when I found it was a musical. the first 10 minutes or so were kinda meh untiL RG showed up then the movie came into it's own. I loved the last 20 minutes or so I wanted them to end up together but I knew they wouldn't. They had different dreams and they just met eachother at the wrong time....or maybe the right time....

that being said i wanna be more like ryan Gosling he just oozes charisma. He's so suave and so charming. Everything he says is like liquid gold. Stud status. That'll literally be my new years resolution. Be more like Ryan Gosling. I have a feeling it'll better me as a person.  Just finished watching it. That might be in my top five favorite movies of all time. It was that good. It was something magical. I hope it sweeps every award. I don't agree that it was a mistake for him to join the band.  I don't think he would have ever achieved his club if he had not joined the band.

The band gave him money and probably even some. name recognition.

The director said that he actually agrees with Keith on the importance of music evolving he said he wanted to show that Seb was compromising but that he was also changing his perspective as well.  It was through moving forward and compromising that Seb was able to achieve his dreams.

Both pushed each other in the right directions.  But away from each other.

Just because two people love each other does not mean they should necessarily give up all of their vocations and their dreams to be together.

Relationships do require sacrifice but I also think they also call people to being the best they can be.  

It's got to be about more than feelings but also about whether your lives fit. If life is taking two people a part their may be a reason for it.

Perhaps Mia never contacted him because her life fit with her husband both had the same goals and dreams.  This is not wrong it's mature.

If one has given up their dream for the other or both did it's totally possible they would have resented each other.  I.e it may have been more selfish to stay together.

Yes relationships are about compromises but they have to be about compromises one can live with. I don't often toss out words like ""wonderful"" or ""adorable"", but that's how I would describe much of La La Land.  I felt human emotions that were initially terrifying, but now make me smile.  
 I am not a big fan of musicals, but I just came out of this film and I cannot stop thinking about it. It's utterly incredible. I'm surprised how many of you are commenting about how you have *City of Stars* stuck in your head. It was all about ""Another Day of Sun"" and ""Someone in the Crowd"" as far as **catchiness** goes.

I'm really hard pressed to say anything bad about *City of Stars*, though, it was beautiful. I'd take *The Audition* over it, though, just for the key change.

\*Strings overarching\*  ""So bring on the rebels, the ripples from pebbles...""  

\**cue me crying* Fascinating how originally Miles Teller & Emma Watson were cast as Mia & Seb?  Alright. I loved this movie. It was beautiful, and the ending had me in a daze of pain as if I were Sebastian. It's been a day now, and I'm at peace with the ending knowing they both accomplished their dreams, which was their true love. I went into the theatre with 0 expectations and had not watched any trailers, only that it was a ""must watch"" by a few of my friends and that it's won awards. 

I gotta admit at the first scene I thought, what have I got myself into, but i'm so glad I stayed till the end of the film, I was glad I watched it.

A bittersweet but realistic moment. Went to bed sad last night after watching this in theatres. Woke up today still a little sad. It definitely sticks with you.  Watched it the first time and was underwhelmed. Watched it the second time and found a new appreciation for it! Now the soundtrack has been on loop.  Taking in my forth viewing now. Send help. This is my front-runner to win Oscar for Best Picture.

Praise:

Opening scene A+

I liked the main characters' interests. Gosling's blind love of Jazz and then understanding that he might have to move away from his purists roots for a job were realistic.

Appreciated the ending - not everything is a La La Land. Sometimes things work out in different ways and it's okay.

The scene paying homage to older classics were neat

The lighting and camera shots/angles were incredible. 

I loved the audition scenes, the hollywood set sequences and the jazz club scene at the end.

Really appreciated the ""5 years later"". Glad there was no other buildup.

Criticism: 

Started off a bit slow after traffic sequence. Felt like all of the power was in the 2nd half.

No side stories, plot or characters. It was truly a 2-person show.



 Dude wtf i saw this movie yesterday and i cant remove the sadness 😢 It's like a deeper feeling about the way how they finished (mia and sebastian)  Damn i really enjoyed the movie. My only complaint is the opening dance number. It felt kinda pointless when you look at the movie as a whole. I could forgive the movie if the song was good but it really wasnt. I dont know thats my only complaint. This really was a great movie. I'm watching it again on amazon and I noticed something really small that no one else seemed to have picked up.  [During the summer part, after Sebastian's performance in the Lighthouse he goes to sit down with Mia and she bumps into their table. For a second, you can see a small item that looks a lot like a ring roll towards Sebastian on the other end of the table and he quickly grabs it without her noticing and smiles. It was so brief that I only noticed it on my 5th rewatch, and I was wondering if it was supposed to imply that Sebastian was actually going to propose to Emma, but seeing Keith again unsettled him and the downward spiral of their relationship started.](#spoiler) I am a 16 year old teenaged guy whose favorite movies are Star Wars, Braveheart, and LOTR. I am just about as far from the target demo as you can get; and I LOVED this movie. Everything about it from the cinematography to the music. 10/10 Just like Whiplash, the pacing in this movie was amazing. No throwaway scenes that I can think of off the top of my head, every shot had *something* to contribute to the overall film. It didn't even feel close to a 2 hour 10 minute movie! Movie was good. But as a musical i would grade it 'just ok'. Too many instances where the dubbing and lip syncing totally took me out of the movie. 10/10 Beautiful, amazing film. Hope it wins the Oscar for best picture. The only thing I can add to what everyone else has already said is that I was patiently waiting and ultimately disappointed not to hear J.K. Simmons ask Sebastian if he was rushing or if he was dragging. Late to the party, but this movie is absolutely *fantastic*. I was charmed, dazzled, entertained, emotionally moved, and completely and totally enthralled. Chazelle has quickly become one of my favorite filmmakers. Whiplash is one of my favorite movies in recent years, but he outdid himself here. The minute the opening number hit I was in love. Each original song was amazing, Justin Hurwitz is excellent. I like his work here more than in Whiplash. The CinemaScope was a great touch, it looked and felt like old Hollywood, which was likely the point. I was extremely impressed with Stone and Gosling's performances, as well. Emma Stone has quickly become my absolute favorite actress and I expect her to get the Oscar for this performance, and I think Casey Affleck is the only thing that will stop Gosling, but that will not take away from Gosling's sterling performance. Going to see it for a second time today, which I rarely do in theaters. Honestly one of my favorite pictures ever.   As someone who's been living in LA for barely a year with little success and losing a wonderful relationship because of our radically different career goals, this movie hit me hard.

It also gave me hope to push harder. Was it just me or were there some parts that looked out of focus, or took awhile to get into focus? It could've also been the theater.

Also, I don't think my theater's sound was set up the best, because the singing audio seemed a little low compared to the instruments. Was that the theater too or was that the movie?

Finally, during John Legend's performance at the concert, I'm pretty sure they used a clip from Whiplash of the drummer hitting a drum. Anyone else spot that?

Otherwise, great movie!!!

Edit: Also noticed in La La Land, Damien did the same camera movement where it went from one person, pan 180 degrees to another person, and then back. In Whiplash it kind of represented the battle going on, but in this I can't remember why it was used, but it worked. That last scene was so sad. I'm glad it didn't have a Hollywood ending where everything is neatly wrapped up and everything works out. It reminds me of how fleeting everything is. This movie charmed the hell out of me.  Gosling is killing it this year for me between this and The Nice Guys. While it made me wistful, [I loved the fact that, despite Mia getting her dream in both endings, Seb got his initial dream only in the real ending. In the alternate ending, Mia became his dream.](#spoiler) I dunno, it was just beautiful. Haven't been so entranced and transported by a film in a while! I loved the long takes. Oh my word it was so beautifully filmed. I'd like to share my opinion of the ending with other people. [With that kinda flashback montage, I thought Sebastian was telling Mia what he would've done differently had he known where it would lead them. I saw a review saying that the movie was about how you really never can reach every dream you set your mind to, at one point in the film I think Sebastian says something along the lines of making sacrifices and grinding for your dreams. But the movie starts with a song about optimism and never giving up, I think the ending montage is a way for him to say ""You know what, if this and that happened, we both would've achieved our dreams and still would be together, but thank you anyways, I'll always love you""﻿](#spoiler) Chazelle pulled a Spike Lee on us (25th Hour). He showed us the ending we wanted then took it away from us. Does Tom Everett Scott have to ruin everything, btw that was Tom Everett Scott playing Emma's husband.

So Emma Stone is obviously going to win Best Actress just from her ending audition scene. 3 minutes of close up singing. Worked for Anne Hathaway and will work for her.

Magical film, watch it. I loved how once the two main characters get together, almost every scene with Sebastian and Mia is shot to include both of them in the shot, whether over the shoulder or whatever.  But then at the dinner table during their fight it switches to direct shots.  Just a subtle way to paint their separation.

And I love how they edited an entire party scene over a shot of champagne being poured. I thought it was cool how the musical scenes were shot like a play, with long, flowing, single-cam continuous shots, and the drama/rom scenes were multi-cam traditional angles and  it.  Completely agree. It was beautifully shot

 I'm guessing Damian gets best Director, but Best Picture goes to Moonlight or Manchester. Emma *WILL* get best actress. Cinematography is a lock on. That ending... man.... I never connected any better with any other montage in any other film. Damian certainly sticks his landings. I'm so happy someone mentioned it. The camera dances through the musical numbers. It's gorgeous.  Will i like this movie if im typically not a fan of musicals? I LOVED Whiplash and Birdman which both seem similar to this, but im not usually a fan of people spontaneously jumping into song and dance like in Moulin Rouge. As another youngish person who doesn't know what he wants to do in life I took it as a thought of compromise of some sort. A compromise on the ""perfect life"" as you'll never achieve it. Mia and Sebastian achieved their dreams but they sacrificed each other. They showed an alternate reality that we all strive for (not only for us but for them) in the dream they had. But that is not real life. It cant be perfect, but that shouldn't stop you from chasing your dreams  Ha, I just recently saw ""Master of None"" and that Sylvia Plath quote played a big part in it. Thanks for this. This is exactly why I was fine the whole movie and then bawled my eyes out for the last ten minutes and the credits. >  When we pursue our dreams are we sure we're pursuing the dream we absolutely want? Is there a road that we should of taken that would of made us happier. Being young and not knowing what I want to do with my life yet, this hit home hard, because I don't know if what I want is what I want and if it is what I want what windows will close when I take that road.

As a no-longer-so-young person, just imagine how hard it hits to think back on whether the major things in our past that we regret (or just feel like we missed out on) could have gone a different way. :D

For me, it hits even harder considering how similar some of the situations in *La La Land* are to those I've gone through in my own life.

On the other hand, the fact that the main characters still managed to live out their dreams in the end wraps things up nicely, even if the relationship itself didn't ultimately work out. Similarly, there are people I've loved so much that I could easily have seen myself spending the rest of my life with them; nonetheless, I'd rather see them fulfill their bigger ambitions in life than to be unhappy with me, and will always be super happy for them -- and I know they feel the same.

(Sorry, I know I'm digging this thread up from a month ago, but I just now got around to seeing the movie.) And then I think about how Sylvia Plath ended up killing herself with her head in an oven..... Reminds me to not overthink it too much. Or I'm prone to getting depressed and worrying about the path I'm on, instead of enjoying the ride. 

I think a little introspection is good, but IMO, be careful not to dwell in those thoughts too much.  You're sure to make yourself miserable no matter what. 

 Gosling has great comedic timing (the nice guys, crazy stupid love), can sing and dance, can do drama (half nelson, blue valentine), can brood (Drive). He's a seriously versatile actor.  Or during the photoshoot when Gosling had to bite his lip was equally hilarious. Or when jk Simmons stands by the door menacing, then goes into a happy little dance  *""Why YOU trippin', Jamal?""* Even the musical numbers had some great funny moments. His deadpan delivery of ""It's wool"" had me rolling. Both actors definitely have excellent comedic chops.  A lot of subtle humor too. Like how the opening number sets the scene describing how warm and sunny it is, and then the song ends with the title card ""Winter."" It was a cute little jab at how paradisiacal Los Angeles is.  I thought this was the funniest movie I've seen all year, and it's not even a comedy. Loved it His character in the Big Short was great too I think the part where John Legend approaches him and Emma and he just puts his hands like up ""nah"" and John Legend makes a ""okay I tried"" face was the funniest thing I may have ever seen. I absolutely died. ""It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!"" I realized during my second viewing that this line perfectly describes the whole movie. Absolutely beautiful. OK now I'm gonna cry ^^^\(again) Adding to that, Sebastian talks about the roots of Jazz, in which people living in tenements in New Orleans came from all different backgrounds and nationalities, and that jazz was their only way of communicating with each other. 

And then long sequences of the film feature no dialog whatsoever and the entire plot and the characters' emotions are communicated through the music. Just a nice touch I noticed. Chazelle really likes his jazz. Will i like this movie if im typically not a fan of musicals? I LOVED Whiplash and Birdman which both seem similar to this, but im not usually a fan of people spontaneously jumping into song and dance like in Moulin Rouge. I absolutely love this point. This is the best thing I've read in reference to the movie as a matter of fact. I noticed that too. This film is loaded with so many of those little moments that I can't wait to see it again.  I disagree with this part. To appreciate jazz you need to see it live but once you do you can appreciate it recorded. He had jazz playing in the background in his car too. 

I still think that music was significant because the music stopped at the start of the fight abruptly without the track fading out  This also happens when Mia is at dinner with her boyfriend Greg when she decides to leave. I thought it was extremely ironic that they were keeping the jazz in the background while Seb talked about how it's wrong to keep jazz in the background. So you want to dress like a serious firefighter? Haha. As I was watching the film I kept thinking to myself I'd love to have the amazing dresses Emma Stone wore. The wardrobe overall was just great! I seriously must have thought ""Damn I want a suit like that"" during every single scene. You wouldn't look as cute in that polyester suit though Ryan Gosling is the only guy who can pull off having a crew neck showing under his button down.  I mean I loved it but that also bothered me. Neither of them have great jobs but they live and dress in luxury.  Funny you say that because as I was watching it I kept thinking about how cute Emma Stone's outfits were in it and wanting to have more outfits like hers. What, he has like two pairs of shoes that he wears in the entire five years?? Chazelle really knows how to end a film. This, *Whiplash*, *Guy and Madeline* and *Grand Piano* all leave you astounded and with this wonderful appreciation for music. It was a roller coaster of emotions, and I cried liked a bitch and I regret nothing. Just watched the movie hours ago , i really thought that the ""dream"" sequence was THE REAL DEAL like , that is what really happened... but then... the freakin husband appears next to her in the club. My heart is broken.  [deleted] The lack of songs in the mid-section is an organic reflection of the state of the main couple's relationship. Reality hits, in a way. It's intentional.  While the singing and dancing may have died off for a bit, music was constant and important throughout the whole movie.  I'm sure they included the fantastical version in the trailer to have that bait and switch effect in the film. I was expecting the kiss as a sort of, ""Fuck it I've just been fired"" move, but when he nudged past her I felt just as surprised and insulted as Mia did. SOMEONE IN THE CROWD WILL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU WANNA GO

IF YOU'RE THE SOMEONE READY TO BE FOUND I THINK ABOUT THAT DAYYY I LEFT HIM AT A GREY-HOUND STATION I got it as a free track from iTunes for signing up for a newsletter and got it for free. It gets stuck in my head so easily. I hope that my local theater gets it in time for Christmas, because that would make the year I've been having a lot better. It's ""Another Day of Sun"" for me. I'd love to see ""the making of"" that opening scene. It was jaw dropping. You're spot on.

Also recall the quote, **""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine,""** and replace gin joints with jazz clubs. I gotta watch Casablanca now  I think that's a really good comparison with Casablanca.

 Seems like you and I are among the few that have recognized this about the ""Happy hollywood ending"" as others are calling it. It wasn't really a happy ending, because Seb wouldn't have been TRULY happy if he hadn't reached his dream. I'm late to this party, but yes. I've been looking for a comment like this one. That was the first thing I thought about when I read other people mentioning the ""what could have been"" sequence. It was all in her head. It was what she wanted to happen. And I didn't really put that together until they saw the jazz club, and walked in together that I realized it wasn't his club. He never really he'd his dream, he was just along for the ride of her dream. It was subtle, and I think it'll be realized more upon more viewings. 

This was long winded and a bit of a circlejerk reply, but I've been thinking about it all day. Saw it today. Freaking loved it.  I saw the ending as a visual representation of Ryan's song at the end, or fantasy if you will. 

As a musician myself, I was always taught that jazz solos are personal stories expressed through the song. I THINK they mentioned it in the movie but I'm not 100% positive. 

So at the end it started with Ryan playing a few notes of the song which reminded him of Emma and as he was ""playing"" the movie we were watching was his inner story going ""oh man, I should have done it this way and did this differently and we might actually be together today."" 

Then the fantasy comes up to the present where he's finishing his song and it's back in reality. 

But anyways that's just my take on it :0) I hear what you're saying, but the montage ended with the at Seb's sitting together. Isn't having a club his dream?  [deleted] Just saw the movie last night and I liked that quote too. Also appreciated when John Legend said something to the effect of ""you can't revolutionize if you're stuck in the past"", and I really liked that sentiment as well! I know a lot of musicians who are trying to play the same stuff forever, but growth and evolution are important for everybody to keep moving or make an impact on history. Lots of quotable moments, lovely film.  [I love how mia face was like wtf when she heard the messengers' music she clearly did not liked it](#spoiler) I saw in an interview that that was a line Ryan put in himself! It was something Eva Mendes said to him jokingly, and he thought it fit very well in the movie. Neat how that kind of thing works out.  Yeah it was cinematic magic . It's what movies should feel like  wait why is it called la la land? i never caught why Best film of 2016. Personally, thought it was better than even Arrival and Moonlight which I adored  Also would have been mad distracting watching him chat jazz with JK Simmons.  Miles Teller doesn't have that easy going charm necessary for Sebastian's character. I don't think Emma Watson has the emotional vulnerability to pull off Mia too In the original screenplay you could argue Sebastian is written in the voice of Miles Teller and it would have suited that actors natural mannerisms and behavior a lot better.

He's a lot more cocky, much more of an asshole and the JK/Boss bantering is barely featured as much. 

The portrayal of Sebastian we got with Gosling is a lot more of an older soul and not so much of a pretentious hipster as it was originally written, which I am happy about. 

The finished film really shows the impact Gosling brought to the project, ultimately making it a lot better in my opinion.  oh god that would've been terrible lmao. Not that Miles Teller can't act; but Gosling is just so much better for the role. Apparently Chazelle dumped him cause he kept complaining about wanting to get paid more then Emma Stone Yes, I was thinking about the themes too. Dreaming and failing, is far better than 'settling' in life. It's difficult to summarise: but if life is a meal, you can pick and control the ingredients by your actions. However, the final 'recipe' is usually the result of your endeavours, plus chance.  This is how I judge how compelling a movie is too.  My theater was silent for a moment when the end card appeared and then erupted into applause. I saw it at a festival and there were a few clapping moments . Everyone clapped after the opening  British here. We don't do that. But I wanted to.  Right when the credits came up my theater erupted into applause. I could tell everyone was absolutely floored. Yeah, this movie got me hard in all the places it could. I was crying in that ending scene of what could have been. The Griffith Observatory scene gave me chills.  It was like watching a painting.  Absolutely gorgeous cinematography. [deleted] I wish I could watch that ending on YouTube instead of waiting to see it again in the theater. But it's best enjoyed on the big screen. > After they kiss and it did that little fade out, my theater erupted with applause.

That's really cool because they definitely did the classic 2 act musical where Act 1 ends on a high note (the kiss) that wraps up the first act's plot and then Act 2 introduces a new conflict. If it was live theater, people should feel compelled to applaud for Act 1. I liked how deliberate it was a lot.  I think it's not like they couldn't be together, it's just that they ended up needing to be alone for a while. They moved on. I think they both helped each other reach their goals for sure and they needed to be alone to do that completely. Because in that ""happy"" dream sequence they did end up kind of reaching their goals but Seb never owned the club.  I don't see how it's not a happy ending.  Traditionally, maybe happy endings means they end up together, but neither character's gripe in the beginning was about finding love.  Even the musical number ""In the Crowd"" was as much about meeting a significant other as it was networking for careers; it seemed ambiguous to me.  I think both characters achieved exactly what they wanted at the beginning of the film and that is a beautiful thing.  

I think that it's a wonderfully happy ending in spite of the fact they didn't end up together.  Both characters seem undeniably happy in the end, even if they were overcome with some strange ""what could have been"" emotions when they briefly cross paths after all that time.  

Then again, maybe I'm jaded and resonates with me because I went through the same thing last year.  I ended a relationship because we were ambitious and one's dream would have suffered more than the other's to make the relationship a success.  People are not a goal in life.   Will always upvote a (500) Says of Summer reference.  Only thing I can complain about is I wish there were more songs. The lull in the last third without any singing was kinda noticeable.  The only thing I've heard bad is that it's a musical and Emma stone/Ryan gosling are only ok singers, when musicals are best with great singers  The opening number song is a classic. That song will live on for ages along with City of Stars . I literally get goosebumps listening to some of it. The movie really hit the emotions with the ending for me  i was punched in the stomach when i saw Sebastien and her parted.

it's definitely a memorable ending though. My wishful thinking was that I was trying to rationalize her divorcing this guy and going back to Seb. My inner monologue went something along the lines of, ""People divorce all the time, what's the big deal? She should go to him! Why won't she go to him!"" Precisely my thoughts. [I too was hoping she was on set, up until they took that turn with the car. The from the previous scene stopped and it just felt like that, alas, that must be the reality](#spoiler) Someone in the Crowd, yeah. Longest song of the movie, hits so many different emotional beats, and ends in Nirvana. It's incredible.  I love how it's shot.  They're all wearing different bright Technicolor dresses and all of the camerawork focuses on Mia and how out of place she feels in crowds. Are you me? Because I swear I said this verbatim the other night. It definitely seemed like the voices were quiet. If you listen to the soundtrack on something like spotify, It sounds a lot clearer yup! the mix was bad so you couldn't understand the singers in the big group numbers at the beginning. hopefully that's something they fix on future releases I thought I was gonna hate it when my girlfriend dragged me along. It was incredible! Loved every minute of it and didn't want it to end! I don't even like musical's! Her audition scene towards the end was epic! 

I laughed, I cried, and I felt everything in between. Beautiful movie! I have a feeling the people saying they don't like musicals but they liked this actually do like musicals and just don't know it. La La Land is the summation and epitome of what musicals were like in the '40s-'60s.

You should look up some musicals from that time period and I'm sure you'd like some of them. **The Umbrellas of Cherbourg** is Damien Chazelle's favorite movie and it's just wonderful.  I wanted to see Rogue One, my wife wanted to see La La Land. During the final scene at Seb's I turned to my wife and said ""I am so glad we picked this one."" But Someone in the Crowd stays permanently. Chazelle is an absolute master at making ending sequences. There's a couple of wonderful layers to that scene:

1. Sebastian explains the origin of Jazz as a form of communication between people who didn't speak the same language. After 5 years apart, Sebastian didn't have enough words (nor time) in the world to describe his complex feelings to Mia, so he expressed himself through Jazz, sort of a secret language (which he taught her) that only she could fully comprehend at that time.

2. The 'alternate reality' sequence (which felt very much like the 'reality vs imagination' scene in 500 days of summer) was over the top Hollywood on purpose. Sebastian might be saying: ""Mia, I wish our lives could unravel like the movies you're so in love with, but reality is much different, and that's ok. We'll always have what we had"". It also felt like the director's love letter to old Hollywood. Both these elements echo back to the ""I'll always love you"" from the prior scene.

I'm sure there's a bunch of other references, like an homage to Casablanca, etc. But those 2 stood out to me the most. So so powerful.  Best part was that there was closure . They look at each other and they're fine . That made it all for me .  I think the scene where they're showing ""what could have been"" was just perfect. The best part of the movie. 

Mostly I think it was so good because not only do they show ""this is what it would have been if everything turned out perfectly"", they also showed how entirely unrealistic it would have been.

The overwhelming sense of nostalgia was just phenomenal.  That scene at the end where they're imagining where it all went wrong and what could have been if they hadn't messed it up hit way too close to home...:'( That 'alternate reality' kind of dream sequence reminded me a ton of The Red Shoes. Brilliant. That ending sequence was really incredible. This movie didn't do much new, but it was such a joy to watch. > A) Fletcher would have been fired a long time ago at any music school between FumBuck Ohio

As someone who went to school for music, I can definitely believe that a character like Fletcher existed. Hell, I had school music teachers in middle school and high school who were known to have thrown chairs at students for making mistakes. Music teachers can be intense and kinda scary. Whiplash was about the competitive jazz band scene, which is exactly how it actually is. Damien Chazelle said the premise is almost autobiographical because he had similar experiences while competitively performing jazz.  Couldn't agree more, it's hard to describe the effect it's had on me—it made me feel *lighter* almost? Like when they float up into the air at Griffith Observatory. I feel like that could happen to me after watching this movie. I just feel warm when thinking about it. If 2016 and the world have you down, this is a good antidote.  I loved this about it! It was so interesting how nobody texted even once in the film. This will be such an interesting film to watch in 20 years. I'll discuss, because I really want to talk with someone about it, and a lot of my movie friends haven't seen it yet. 

The ending made the movie for me. I enjoyed the movie in general, but I think I hyped it a bit too much, and it seemed like the story was heading for a ""all-is-well-happy-ending."" So I loved how the ending flipped that. For much of the movie I was sort of waiting for a moment that would just make me leap -- I love musicals a lot -- and that happened in the epilogue as we see the ""what might have been."" It was at once fun, and hopeful, and heartbreaking. And to have all those emotions at once was great. I think the way they set that up was so, so good. 

I also loved how Chazelle used that Emma Stone coming home scene. It was so simple, but I felt like he totally set the audience up for the idea that it would be Gosling at home, and then to see another man -- oof, wind out of my sails. And then to play the epilogue. Chazelle just played that last part so well.

I love melancholy endings, so this one was so pleasing to me. Yeah the ending was pretty rough for me as well, my last relationship died post-graduation when my girlfriend had to move out east for medical school right after I'd picked up a new job. 

Both of us knew it was the right thing to do and was the only way for us to both reach our dreams, but it still sucked. That's the feeling I got in the final scene for sure, very well encapsulated by the movie though. Failure is better than regret. The fact is you tried. That's what the movie would support.  How is casablanca not on that list lol I liked that it was so sincere and old-fashioned in its treatment of romance.

No sarcastic quips and snide remarks. That was refreshing I concur with this because [no way would Sebastian just kiss a total stranger especially when in a sour mood after getting fired.](#spoiler)

[I believe that ending sequence was what Sebastian hoped would have happened rather than a ""what if"" had he went to Paris with Mia.  It was not some sort of alternative reality.  He played that sad tune with the deepest longing for both to be professionally successful and wind up together.](#spoiler)

The morale of the ending is, [even when you achieve your dreams, it's not gonna happen perfectly.  Life is about making sacrifices, which is an indirect critique of the entitlement mentality many young people have today or the mentality ""you can have it all"".](#spoiler)

[A lot of people complained about the ending.  But it was the perfect ending, albeit one we didn't expect or desire.  Had they ended together and successful, there wouldn't have been a message and it'd just be another brainless fairy tale. ](#spoiler) I actually write up a bunch of perspectives on the ending down lower but I really also prefer this take on it. The idea that what we're seeing is what Sebastian wishes could have happened to them but it's a ""La La Land"" that isn't realistic. Makes it all that much more sweet IMO. 

Also, I have a personal take on this that unsubstantiated but I absolutely love. Sebastian explains the origin of Jazz as a form of communication between people who didn't speak the same language. How normally when you play Jazz it's a constant push and pull and chaotic series of choices from all the players in the band, a representation of life per say. After 5 years apart, Sebastian didn't have enough words, nor time, in the world to describe his complex feelings to Mia, so he expressed himself through Jazz, but via a song he plays alone without any other musicians or chaos. It's the song/choices he wished he could have played without having to compromise like you do in life.

 Lmao looking back at this thread now this comment is hilarious. Absolutely breath taking, could and should win multiple awards this year I disagree. I thought that scene was meant to show that Sebastian didn't like the music he was playing, and that he was only doing it for the money. I think the simplicity of the lyrics were meant to show that Sebastian was selling out, in a sense. The way Mia gave a concerned look reaffirmed that to me.  I think Moonlight is still a very strong contender. That was basically Chazelle wrestling in his own head about classical musicals vs. how to make modern ones that connect with audiences. His answer to that question was this movie.  I think it speaks to the audience because it very beautifully portrays love in real life, which doesn't always lead to a 'happily ever after' and leaves you with sweet memories from the past to imagine the life you could have had. Love lasts even (and especially) in the absence of your lover, and it often demands very difficult choices and sacrifices to the point of almost being unfair. I'm speaking from my personal experience here. Another interpretation is that they both imagine what could have been and make their peace with it. They're not unhappy, but they will, true to their word, always love each other. So imagining that other life still pulls at us, because we will always want to experience it and see them get that life.

But the smile and nod at the end is a final mutual recognition of their love and gratitude for each other. You could reason that, even though they could not be together, they were content. In my mind, everything they experience after her decisive audition they still experience together, because they together choose to throw themselves into their passions. Who's to say they would have been happier with their moderate success? Sometimes love means letting go, but that doesn't erase the love or make everything else not worth it. What I loved about the ""what if""/dream sequence is that [the entire sequence is played out in a way as if Mia had asked Sebastian to leave his dreams behind and follow her to Paris, the way he once asks her to follow him, and which effectively concludes their relationship as they knew it. The film takes the guy-chases-his-dream-and-girl-supports-his-dreams trope and turns it on its head in the dream sequence.](#spoiler)
For all the feminists complaining about how Mia never once wears pants in the film, I thought that was marvellous display of restoring some equilibrium in gender roles in cinema. I think this may be on of the most postmodern movies I've ever seen. It shows 2 distinct possibilities: chasing your dreams, or settling (in this case with someone). I think the film shows that either can be done, but each has a cost. There is always a cost, and you can (practically never) have everything you want all at once.

In the end, it's not telling you to chase your dreams. It's telling you that no matter what you go for, there is always sadness as well, and that ultimately it doesn't matter what you do. It's completely your choice.

I'm not a huge fan of postmodernism, as it may have come across, and some people may judge this as a good thing. I'm just pointing out that it doesn't prescribe a course of action, it simply points out possibilities and pros/cons. Ah, loved the ending.

I had a slightly different interpretation of the ending. It felt like they both realized that life isn't a La La Land. They weren't meant to live happily ever after together. Instead they were meant to cross paths to eventually push each other away to fulfill their destinies/dreams. At first Seb and Mia are shocked/sad to see each other (the one that got away) but it ends in a smile (things worked out okay. TTYL). >  His discomfort when John Legend's band starts playing synthesizers in their first rehearsal is irritating.

I felt the same, but maybe that's intended to be part of his 'achilles heel' of having a tunnel vision that at the very end he himself recognizes as being a fatal flaw. I agree with your point about the characters, but gosling and stone had enough chemistry and charisma that It didn't really bother me.  

And while it is essentially a bittersweet fairytale, I don't think it would have worked with a more realistic ending, like them being content with more modest careers and having a relationship.  Absolutely, that ending is heartbreaking [deleted] Said this in a couple different places now, but I think the opening number did exactly what it was supposed to do. It was a personification of the wide-eyed dream of moving to LA and becoming a star, where everyone is happy, the sun is shining, and you can chase your dreams and dance on the freeway or what have you. 

As the film goes on, the numbers become less and less, and it culminates at the ending where we see Gosling's one last ""dream"" at the piano, side by side with what reality is. Opening numbers are basically the overtures for musicals (outside of the overture itself lol). They give you a broad sense of the tone and themes of the show, while not necessarily focusing on the plot or main characters. That'd be my defense for why it felt out of place. 

The song not being good is of course up to your personal taste, but I invite you to listen to it again on Spotify or something. At least in my theater, the sound mixing wasn't very good so I could barely hear the vocals over the orchestra, which could possibly be why you weren't too taken by it?   I'm 20 i hate romantic movies and i absolutely am not a fan of musicals. However, this movie was so on point for me... just well balanced, the music, the passion that they have for achieving their dreams. It's so dream-like that it just made me jump into that world. Plus after hearing all this great music i decided to go back to playing piano. For sure i will remember this film as one of my most liked movies. I also want to point out that I'm no expert and probably there is a handful of people that wouldn't like this picture : ).  [deleted] I also liked that Emma kept eye contact that whole scene, while Ryan was looking down the whole time until he snapped. I think you would. It's not heavy on the music/dancing scenes and there's enough visually to keep you entertained during singing sequences if you're not a music person. I'd say its refreshing to see something a bit different, like Birdman. Give it a go! Thank you very much for this, I thought about the same thing as you said at the theatre, this makes me cry because we need to make sacrifices in life to achieve our dreams and is painful but it should and needs to be worth it. That ""what could of been"" broke my heart , just watched the movie yesterday The last episode of Master of None really reminded me of the end of La La Land. 

 Not to mention he oozes charisma, as well. I, by sheer coincidence, picked up Drive last week, watched The Nice Guys 2 nights ago, and on a whim saw this movie tonight. Seeing him play such different roles so close together really magnified how diverse his acting could be.
 honestly, I *wanted* to laugh during that scene but it was so sad to me. It was exactly the opposite of what he envisioned his goal as and it made me so sad to have this old guy pushing him to fit into the role he didn't wanna be in, while his most valuable relationship is going down the toilet. I think the funniest part was when at practice The band went into that god awful electronic music. I felt as much disdain as Sebastian did in that moment  After he motioned for Seb to happily leave through the door, I whispered under my breath, ""Not my tempo, Seb, but alright."" There were a lot of those ironic touches, like when he accidentally turns right instead of left down the road. Completely agree. And the film sort of starts off very old-timey with the musical atmosphere, and Sebastion's old school car. I didn't know much about the movie before I went, and I wasn't sure what year it took place in. At first I thought it was maybe an older period piece and then boom, flash to Mia on an iPhone. I chuckled a bit.  That scene where Mia lip syncs I Ran had me in tears. *Couldn't get away!*

In the epilogue where John Legend just turns away laughing, ok, I'm gone.

**You're not meaning what you're saying!** What part of you're fired you don't understand? Yeah his narcissistic asshole stole the show in that movie. Much funnier than one would expect a movie about finance to be.  If you want to cry ^^(again) then listen to the soundtrack while laying down trying to sleep. That really got me I think this movie has a lot to offer aside from it's music, but it is still a musical. If you liked Whiplash, you'll probably like this because it is the same director, and he does a fantastic job again. I also liked how intense the music was getting, it reminded me of how he said Jazz is conflict and it was building up as their argument got worse But when he's listening to jazz in his car it wasn't for enjoyment. He was using it to practice his keystrokes. Yes, I would like her entire wardrobe delivered to me, please! I love all the solid bright primary colors she wears throughout.  It's wool Yeah when he picks Mia up for her audition later in the movie and checks the time, you can see that he's wearing some sort of Omega, a watch that likely cost a few thousand dollars. Honestly the costuming in this movie was terrific  Good shoes last decades I fucking love that man.  Damn he did whiplash? He also did a lot for the *10 Cloverfield Lane* script. That's the beauty of this film. People would think that it would be like every other musical/drama films that have happy endings. But it's a mix of fantasy and reality, and left the viewers in a mixed emotion. [deleted] I agree! I hated the ending, because it painted a picture of how much better life would have been if they had stayed together. You spent the entire film being romantic and building up the relationship between these two, only to shatter it. 
I'm just not sure why such a movie based in fantasy and whimsy would have such a cynical conclusion. It seems wrong to show the audience the ending they've been rooting for only to rip it away and say, in classic Wayne's World fashion, ""NOT!""

**I'm going to discuss the endings of Good Will Hunting, Annie Hall, 500 Days of Summer, and When Harry Met Sally. If you haven't seen them, beware of spoilers.**

I don't buy the, ""Well, that's what real life is like."" Especially not for this movie! The whole thing was a fantasy. Would Good Will Hunting have been better if at the end Will took the job, didn't go after Skyler, since that's how things would go in real life?

At the end of Annie Hall it's bittersweet, but you're not crushed that Annie and Alvy aren't together. You get the feeling that they've both moved on with their lives, and they're better people because of their time together, but they're not devastated imagining the life that they could have lived.

Even in 500 Days of Summer you understand that they were never really meant for each other. He was selfish, and he didn't realize that.

I would have much preferred something like When Harry Met Sally, which is on the surface, a much more cynical film than La La Land. But when Billy Crystal runs into the party and says 'When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible' it reenforces the fact that these two should be together.
 The transition from a lack of cuts at the start (creating a dreamlike quality) to quick,  staccato cuts when the relationship turns rocky was a great touch! This was such a beautifully made film,  I could have enjoyed it even if I did not understand the language  It was definitely intentional. If there was an Oscar for trailers, La La Land should win them all. I haven't seen trailers augment a movie like that without actually giving anything away. That track has been on repeat for the past week. I love the chord progression and how the 3 or 4 themes blend seamlessly with each other. So many feeeeeels. WEST OF SANTA FE

WE WERE 17 BUT HE WAS SWEET AND IT WAS TRUE

STILL I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DOOOO I guess I'm just too much of a romantic, because I think I'd just feel hollow if I reached my ultimate dream but didn't have my love with me. An empty victory you know? Like it wouldn't be worth it, what's the point of having what you want without anyone to share it with?  I disagree.

I thought, as Sebastian said earlier, Jazz is a language so people can speak to one another in a room where they can't actually communicate.

Seb's song is him communicating to Mia what he wants/wanted. It's his fantasy, and it turns out that his dream was never to own a jazz bar - it was to be with and support Mia. Yeah, that's how I saw it too. The dream was a cinematic expression of Ryan's song, but I think it's a song of the perfect life where all of their dreams come true in the perfect way.

However, he is revising history in a way that can't and couldn't have been reality, as we see from the start with the kiss, and other unreal scenes like a full audience at Emma's performance. In reality, you have to choose which dreams to follow and make sacrifices for them. There is conflict and compromise, which the perfect dream lacks.

Also, even though they both feel remorse over losing each other, the film ends with them sharing a slight smile. Maybe I'm overreading it, but I think they are happy with the dreams they chose to follow. Their art came first, and their love was a close second. Of course they wish they could have it all, but they are satisfied with what they got. But in the dream sequence it wasn't actually his club. It was just a random joint they happened to stop in at, so he never really got to achieve his life goal. But the club in Paris *was* his club.  The sign said ""Chicken on a Stick"" in French. I feel the same way. I'm an extremely passionate Star Wars fan, and on that level Rogue One spoke to me wonderfully, but I just walked out of La La Land 20 minutes ago and damn.... It's that rare feeling you get when you know you just watched and all-time masterpiece.  I don't think Rogue One was really trying to have heart.  Yeah they both had two very relatable, understandable and agreeable stances. Neither of them were fully right or wrong.  I thought she liked it but was taken aback that Sebastian would do that kind of music.  Heh, so I thought 'la-la land' just meant a fanciful dreamworld and that it was clever because it was set in Los Angeles (LA LA Land). Buuut I just Googled it and learnt that's exactly where 'la-la land' derives from. Bit gutted.

Also, they planned to have a key song called La La Land but was cut out.  My thoughts exactly, it would have reminded too much of their relationship in Whiplash.  The story alone, an aspiring musician beating himself up for not achieving his dreams, would have been distractingly similar to Whiplash.  ""*You don't mean what you're s-*""

""*I WILL FUCK YOU LIKE A PIG*"" Miles Teller has charm, but its cocky charm.  I think Gosling's charm works because of the humility he also portrayed in the character. I wonder if she's kicking herself for not taking it and instead taking a remake of a beloved animated movie, which is all dandy but it won't win awards. I saw a premier of the film with a Q&A with one of the producers, who said that was the exact reason they really wanted to cast Gosling--he brought an effortless ""coolness"" to the character, and was charming and young while still coming across as experienced enough to be taken seriously on his jazz obsesssion. >The portrayal of Sebastian we got with Gosling is a lot more of an older soul and not so much of a pretentious hipster as it was originally written, which I am happy about.

Oh definitely.  It suits his character as a jazz musician so much more.  When you meet a lot of jazz musicians nowadays you get the impression that they would have adored being born in a different era when jazz was coming into its own.   My brother is a jazz musician and the way Sebastian talks in Lala land reminds me so much of him  I do this thing where I don't drink anything 6 hours prior to watching a movie in theatres. I'm gonna pretend there are commas before and after 'hard' in your post for selfish reasons. 

You dirty boy.  Yeah, I think what the happy ending was trying to show was that in order to be happy together, one of them would have had to give up on their dreams.  The last third did have Audition?  This was intentional! It was to reflect the state of their relationship as the movie progressed.  I felt like Chazelle and Co. were very aware that Emma and Ryan weren't amazing singers and utilised the little flaws to become a part of the aesthetic. Like how Emma starts laughing in the middle of the *City of Stars* duet. I absolutely loved it.  I thought they sounded great, even if they aren't the most gifted singers they sold the hell out of it. To perform in a musical you need to be an actor first and a singer second. I think when people forget this you get singers who get cast who can't act through a song. And in this case the music is original so it could be written to suit their voices.  The opening number and Someone in the Crowd are two of the catchiest musical type songs I've heard in a very long time. So freaking well-written. It helps that the sequences that those songs were paired with were also incredibly stunning and amazing to watch. God this is an incredible film. I have seen this twice now in different theaters and also listened to the soundtrack with headphones and yeah, the vocals are mixed weirdly low in nearly all the songs (John Legend's number being an exception.) I could barely hear/understand the lyrics in Another Day of Sun, especially when multiple vocalists are singing. It's quite odd and the first time I saw the movie I actually thought there was something wrong with my particular theater's speakers.  I dont know man, back where Im from we have a radio station called musical.fm and people just put it on during parties as background noise Definitely, this is what I'm constantly saying. Grease and Mamma Mia (although they're not awful) aren't really all there is to musicals. Neither are Disney films for that matter.

I don't think such a thing as an exclusively bad genre actually exist. It's just that some suffer bastardisation and abuse way worse than others when there's a formula for commercial success. I mean, some musicals like Les Miserables (not necessarily the most recent rendition) or La La Land are classics and pretty great as well! And some are… well bad. And these are the ones that tend to stay longer in people's minds.

It's kind of the same as the Superhero genre, which is usually awful and formulaic, but every now and then a *great* film will pop up and prove that it's a genre that has lots of room to explore when done right ""We"" Man, this post really kind of changed my perception of some of this movie. I'm definitely aware that fantastical things in this movie happen as an abstract means of portraying something that's too incredible to depict in a ""normal"" way. For example, the dance in the observatory, Mia's song in her audition, etc. 

I also knew that the ending sequence was meant to say that they couldn't have gotten their ""happy ending"" unless someone gave up on their dream. I wasn't able to figure out why the fantasy, then, showed Seb following Mia instead of vice versa or both. Your interpretation I think is correct, and makes that entire scene a lot more powerful.  To me, it harkens back to the moment when Sebastian asks Mia why she doesn't want to be an actress anymore and she says something along the lines of ""It hurts too much.""

Sebastian's vision of their future (or was it Mia's) is a beautiful story, but it's somehow not quite as beautiful as the painful reality of the way their relationship really ended.  Same here. They both achieved their life dreams and they are both so happy. Even though what could've been would have been great, they are in a great place and especially thankful for each other and the impact each had. Those little smiles made it all for me I must have blinked or something because I totally did not think they were fine when it ended and it is tearing me apart. I need to rewatch this asap for some god damn closure. > They look at each other and they're fine.

Seb was so far from okay. Dude was literally devastated, hence the raw emotion he poured into his song & why it was so powerful & moving. Mia, well she just had to leave. She was pretty shaken up. I think that scene, for me at least, was about perfection.  The reality in that scene was that they both wanted to achieve their dreams and it all just kind of happened for them without the struggle, heartbreak, and persistence in the real world.  It showed that they could have been together if achieving their dreams was easy and would just happen for them, but it made the point that if 2 people in love both want to achieve their dreams, the world is so hard and so unforgiving that if they want to make their dreams a reality, they will probably have to put love aside and do anything they can (like move to paris) to make it happen.  When they do this, their individual desire to achieve their dreams will ultimately separate them and they will end up moving on from each other.

In a perfect world, they would each achieve their dreams effortlessly and get to spend their lifes together.  In the real world, you have to make serious serious sacrifices in order to make your dreams reality, and that sacrfice may include a shot at true love.  This montage at the end of the film was the true 'La La Land' that could never exist in the real world. The fact that it's implied he's expressing all of it through the piano, and that she just innately *knows* -- beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. > I think the scene where they're showing ""what could have been"" was just perfect. The best part of the movie

I get the feeling this scene is the origins of the whole idea for the film and everything else was built up to lead up to that point. I don't think they really messed it up. I think in the current timeline he found it better for both of them to win and achieve their dreams on top of remembering the journey than it being smooth and only one set of dreams came true. I cried so hard... I thought there may have been a plot twist and the alternate happy montage became the real timeline. Glad it wasn't though. Yep, my thoughts too. I was a music major and Whiplash, while amazing, gave me anxiety because I have worked with directors like Fletcher before... Lmao i'm doing the same and laughing I'm not talking about the concert (you're 100% right about that), I'm talking about the scene when John Legend is telling him that the best jazz players were revolutionaries, not traditionalists like he is right now.  I liked both of them a lot, but to me, La La Land blew me away in its originality and complexity. Moonlight was brilliant, but I think this is the case of Boyhood vs. Birdman. The beauty and care with which Boyhood/Moonlight was told is second to none, but the overall spectacle and movie magic of Birdman/La La Land puts it just a step above. >  For all the feminists complaining about how Mia never once wears pants in the film, I thought that was marvellous display of restoring some equilibrium in gender roles in cinema.

Ah typical reddit, all I ever see here is people like you whining about imaginary feminists in every single thread.  >For all the feminists complaining about how Mia never once wears pants in the film

It seems these days we complain about all things that **we think**  feminists would have a problem with

  Feminists had a problem with that? Do you have a source or something? That seems dumb because you can clearly see her in sweats and slacks and she even changes from her heels into more comfortable shoes in the dancing bench scene. Yeah, the movie kind of calls him out on that—Legend's character Keith calls him a pain in the ass and argues that he worships revolutionaries but is a reverent traditionalist. I think it acknowledges that tension and eventually Gosling compromises and it allows him to achieve his goals. I think the name of his club at the end reflects that, ""Seb's"" is not only an acknowledgment of Mia's influence on him and the impact she had on his life, but also that he's more mature and willing to compromise and less of a contrarian now. He's still passionate, but his passion has ben tempered with realism and an acknowledgement that his way wasn't always the right way, and that's allowed him to succeed.  It also wasnt just synths, it was programmed beats that were triggered as a loop not played in sequence, which would be pretty antithetical to the improvisational nature of jazz. He also seems to get more comfortable with the music at the live show where there were presumably no programmed beats and he gets to operate in his space and improvise Really great general red-blue color imagery as well.  At the end when Mia is about to leave Seb's but pauses to make eye contact with Sebastian, there's a really beautiful moment where her face is lit with purple, then she turns and it's blue.  It's basic but effective as fuck.  He's on my list!  What amazes me is that he made all those movies to outstanding critical acclaim. You know that dude is getting mad entailed offers but turns them down to choose projects he seems genuinely interested in. Stuff that challenges him made by creative people. yeah while funny, it was there to highlight how he had been selling out. That scene was soooo good if you're a musician. Because almost every talented musician thinks they're ""too good"" or whatever  for some songs but usually not rude enough to admit it. And then he's like ""How can request I Ran to a serious musician"" 

""Did you just call yourself a serious musician?""

""No.""
 I don't think I can take it. Well by that point hadn't the band been having a lot of success? Probably was getting paid pretty well by then That Omega was beat to shit and really old though. My guess, because this is fairly common, is that it was a gift from his father, grandfather, or some other important older male in his life. There is an allusion to Seb having gone to college as a jazz performance student. The Omega could've been a graduation gift. tbh I think La La Land might be my favorite movie of all time now I can't stop thinking about it. you know I envy that guy and Barry Jenkins so much, they've crafted something of such a high standard and so impeccable that even if you want to try your hand at writing, their works will loom over yours like you're a tiny insect or something. Yup. This and Whiplash are his only major directing credits. Hell of a record. > Both people were headed in different directions and different points of their lives.

I don't feel the movie was trying to make this point. These two dreamers each made compromises to achieve their dreams even though they needed each other to achieve their dream. Unfortunately the compromise was their relationship. How far are you willing to go to reach your dreams? 
 I think the ending smile is meant to show that their is hope, and in the end their fantasies were as fun to them as it was to us.  During that long musical journey at the end, you knew it was going to come crashing back to reality, but regardless it was a hell of a lot of fun. That's what their fantasies, being caught up in la la land, were like. In the back of their minds they knew it was unlikely all. of their dreams weren't going to turn out the way they fantasized about, but it was fun while it lasted, and in the end they DID live their dreams. It was obviously very bittersweet, but you can't have romance without delusion, and to live in the moment with complete disregard to the reality that it won't last forever. Their smile signified that in the end they'll always have their little 'what if' fantasies, and that's enough.   I loved when Sebastian and Mia had the argument, for the first time the camera started to shake organically, rather than the very steady, fluid movements from the beginning of the film. I love that others are viewing this as a brilliant, technical film too. I thought I was reading too much into it when I thought about how the camera work changed whenever their relationship took a tumble, like during the dinner scene. Such a great movie. The only thing I felt like they gave away was that fantastic scene at the observatory. I was just waiting for that to show up the whole time. Didn't make it any less great but I knew it was coming. That party scene was just so great, it had so much energy and vibrancy–when the music roars back as the guy jumps, so good. God, I loved this movie. Those horn blasts are just electric. CAUSE I

JUST KNEW There's absolutely nothing wrong about your perspective, but your dreams are just that - having someone to share with. Other people, like Seb and Mia in the movie, want to find love, but their dreams first and foremost are their creative pursuits. They aren't willing to give up those dreams to find love. You're not too much of anything, you just have different ultimate dreams than they did. I just saw this movie yesterday and I just want to completely agree with you on your statement


I'm such a sucker for love and sappy happy endings that the last 15 minutes killed me. A part of me felt content to see what could have been between Mia and Seb but even if it's not true in my tiny mind I still think they're together 


I get that their not but in my mind that montage allows me to think they are.


Goes to show what a tremendous story it was showing the essence of following your dreams and finding love  That's the thing though. Who says Seb doesn't have someone besides Mia to share it with? Or won't find someone else?

Doesn't mean that they won't always love each other, doesn't mean that there might not be a part of both of them that will always yearn after the other even though they know it'll never happen.

Just means they recognized that the person they'd have to become to make the other happy wouldn't make them happy. dude that's so true. Andrew's first meeting with Nicole (""I was just kidding!"") worked wonders because of it It won't win awards but it probably made her fat stacks. emma watson isn't a good actress imo, and yeah she'll probably never have acclaimed career like stone is able to achieve, but watson is successful no less Pretty sure if Emma Watson was in this instead of Emma Stone, it won't be as critically acclaimed. Movie is going to be shit anyway, they cut ""If I Can't Love Her""...that song was never meant for the big screen, cut from the animated film, put on the Broadway show, cut from the live action one Now that's commitment.  I just pee beforehand yeah i think it was showing that in reality there has to be sacrifices to be fully happy and they either had to sacrifice each other or their dreams in this case Audition is my favorite. ""Intentional"" doesn't always mean ""right decision."" Ah I can see that. There is that period though where they are happy and there isn't any signing.  I loved the fact that they aren't ""singers"" because the music felt so unbelievably organic, the imperfections sounded like part of that natural composition.  Chazelle said he didn't want to cast singers or dancers; he wanted to cast *people*.  He was going for a realism where when people burst into song or start dancing, it was because their character and the emotions demanded it, not because it was a performance. Wish my old high school's musical director remembered this. He cast singers first and it resulted in one of the most wooden performances of South Pacific I've ever seen. I saw it at the Cinedome with a lead in from Damien Chazelle in person. He said he loved that theater since moving to LA and how we were all 'In the right place to see it.' 

Then the first scene started with that mix. Kinda gritted my teeth through the first twenty minutes because I couldn't understand the words. 

Dark Knight Rises Intro all over again ""It was a mutual decision""

""That I made""

""Yes but I agreed with you"" Perhaps if Mia followed Seb (instead of vice versa in the fantasy sequence), they wouldn't have achieved *either* of the goals? This could continue to drive the point home that not only are dreams achieved through sacrifice, but even **then**, they're still not guaranteed. Yes! It shows that there are multiple paths to a happy life. I saw the same thing as you, I think. The final shot is Sebastian's sad face- he can barely look at her. How does that say ""they're fine"" with how things turned out? I just don't understand these comments saying that they were both happy in the end. Yep they were not fine with it. She getting tensed up seeing SEBs and listening to the music, He freezing up seeing, Her asking to leave as she felt uncomfortable. Even if we say it was all circumstantial and they can still be OK with it; the smiles and the facial expressions at the end gave it away. They were OK with that they both had moved on but they still had a clear yearning for each other ! 

Like many decisions we take in life where we are OK with it since we had other priorities and things we valued over that. 

Also does it not feel that Sebastian was more in love with her than she was with him ? Agreed. I need closure and what based on what I remember, the final scene seemed as though they were full of regret. :( Spot on. As the [nytimes review](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/movies/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone.html) said, the movie is about how ""the drive for professional success is, for young people at the present time, both more realistic and more romantic than the pursuit of boy-meets-girl happily-ever-after. Love is contingent. Art is commitment."" In the perfect scenario Sebastian never achieves his dream though. We see him making sacrifice after sacrifice to his musical career to support Mia. For me 'La La Land' is less about perfection and more about the life you could have lived if the decisions you made were different. ""They had no way to communicate except through music.""  And it didn't seemed forced.  technically he was selling out but the reason he did so was out of love for her. he saw her speaking to her mother and he could sense that he didn't have stable money and that he looked like a failure to her. That said, it was absolutely necessary for him to sell out. If he never sold out, he would never have had the money to make Seb's. He was guaranteed $1000 a week when he first signed, so he'd definitely have a fair bit of spare cash considering his humble living conditions. He'd been wearing the Omega for most of the film, I think. [It's on his wrist in the car in the opening scene.](http://timeandtidewatches.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ryan-Gosling-in-La-La-Land.jpg) But you can get some of the less desirable vintage pieces [like](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1960S-VINTAGE-OMEGA-SEAMASTER-AUTOMATIC-WITH-CALENDAR-/291997576986) that [for](http://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-1960S-SS-OMEGA-SEAMASTER-AUTOMATIC-CAL-552-6406-/232186030033)  surprisingly [cheap.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/STUNNING-Vintage-1960s-Omega-Seamaster-De-Ville-Automatic-Watch-14KGF-Runs-Great-/401259068968) Actually it was second time, the first was when Mia failed the callback audition from TV show... It was used with similar intention though. Reading your comment I'm glad I didn't see any trailers or know much about the movie before watching it. Loved the planetarium scene. That guy is credited as pool flipper. SUMMER SUNDAY NIGHTS

WE'D SINK INTO OUR SEAT RIGHT AS THEY DIMMED OUT ALL THE LIGHTS Pretty sure she's already set for 7 generations. I just pee in my hand It's heartbreaking/uplifting all tossed together, plus it was the one song in the movie where the live audio recorded on set is what we hear on screen. It's amazing. 

Have a friend who said it was her least favorite song. I couldn't rationalize that at all. Though I think they're all excellent so I have to have a least favorite I guess.  I also just think they're great singers. Les Mis worked for me and a lot of that cast isn't a traditionally great singer. How frustrating! I really don't understand it. The score is so lovely and I really enjoyed all the performances, even the less-polished vocals from the leads. I don't know where it went wrong in the mixing when so much attention was given to the sound elsewhere.  *I signed off on it I think you can mourn what could have been (the fantasy) while also being ok where you are. He told her - you need to go to Paris and focus on this, and he chose to stay in LA (the film implies she's not living in LA anymore).

That's the point - her fantasy was ultimately less meaningful than having to give up some things to get what she wanted. They share a smile and a nod.  It's a slight smile, but it's there. HOLY

SHIT

Thank you, I already loved the movie but that gave me a whole new appreciation Haha that's brilliant. I think my favorite minor part was that one writer guy, the joke about his Goldilocks and the Three Bears script from the perspective of the bears was too funny.

74,"Brad Pitt tripping on acid pointing the finger gun at Tex was my favorite movie scene in a long time! I loved that Rick told Cliff that he was ""One pool party away from a big break"" and Rick ended up burning the final Manson girl IN THE POOL to finally get friendly with Sharon Tate and her friends “More than a brother but not quite a wife.”

That’s the take away line of the film for me. That scene where DiCaprio tells himself he won’t drink, then proceeds to chug out of the flask and spits it out? I felt that. That scene at the ranch when Cliff was going in to check on George Spahn was so fucking tense. Even the music from the TV was foreboding as hell.

And holy shit, I didn't even realize that was Dakota Fanning. Totally didn't recognize her. I am so, so glad that there wasn’t any acrimony between Cliff and Rick. A surprisingly wholesome take on male friendship. I was genuinely nervous for Cliff's well being in those final scenes. Not often a film does this for me, and for that reason alone this was an awesome experience. Enjoyed it a lot. Jesus fucking Christ Tarantino loves feet I need a Rick Dalton spaghetti western movie poster more than anything. Brandy is a good girl This movie really showcased how great of an actor Leo is. The scene where he throws the girl actually made me forget what movie I was watching. Tarantino wants us to know that extremely attractive women snore Brad and Leo had some great commentary watching his scene in FBI
“Thats a great leap”
“That guys a fucking prick” (Paraphrasing)

“More than a brother, not quite a wife.”

“Thank you for bringing Pussycat home. We love pussy.”
“Yes, we do.”

“The redhead out front?”
“I just told you I’m fucking blind. How should I know what color head she is?”

“If you don’t nail those lines, I’m gonna blow your fucking brains out.”

“I’m the devil, and I’m here to do the devil’s business.”
“...Naw, it wasn’t something dumber than that.”

“Is everyone alright?”
“The hippies ain’t, that’s for fuckin’ sure.”

“These hands are registered as lethal weapons. We get in a fight, I accidentally kill you... I go to jail.”
“Anybody gets in a fight and accidentally kills anybody, they go to jail. It’s called manslaughter.”

“Don’t cry in front of the Mexicans.”

“He said he was the devil... said he was there to do... Devil shit.” When Cliff chucked the dog food can at her face then told the police that Tex was talking about “Devil shit”, I had tears in my eyes from laughing In this thread, I’ve seen a lot of people talking about Pitt’s performance. And don’t get me wrong, him killing hippies while tripping on acid is an all-time Tarantino scene...but this is a top 3 DiCaprio performance. The insecure TV star in the back half of his career is just pure gold...and there are at least 3 scenes that I found myself dumbstruck by his performance. The scene by himself in the trailer after he breaks; the conversation with the little girl about his novel (and what a performance by her as well); and the final climactic scene (flame thrower and “Well, the fucking hippies ain’t, I’ll tell you that). Just a masterclass from DiCaprio. He’s the best we’ve got. The whole set up of Cliff having the flashback of why Kurt Russell’s character didn’t want to cast him was pure gold.

“Fair enough.” “Hey, can you do something bout the heat?”

“Rick.... its a flamethrower”

💀 Imagine stopping the Manson murders while on acid. An hour of this movie is Brad Pitt driving around LA The most satisfying use of Chekhov’s Gun I’ve ever seen in film.

That whole ending was a riot in the best way possible. Please go see it with a packed opening weekend crowd. The more I think about it, the more I like it. Was anyone else really entertained by Leo's Italian wife at the end? Especially when she punched the Manson girl. This movie further solidifies that Brad Pitt and Tarantino are a match made in heaven. “Are you real?”

“I’m as real as a motherfucking donut!” The bad ass cowboy burst into tears and had to be consoled by an 8 year old girl.

The movie built suspense for 20 minutes around a murder that never took place.

The movie was amazing. Did they just say one of the Italian movies was directed by our boy Antonio? That was the longest most expensive set up for a punchline I've ever seen. “My booze doesn’t need a buddy”

I C O N I C Rick walking out with the flamethrower at the end was amazing No one seems to be mentioning the Rick Dalton/Clint Eastwood parallels. 

Eastwood spent 8 years on the tv western Rawhide. His career was at a standstill when that series ended. He then went to Europe and resurrected his career in spaghetti westerns. Came home and struck gold with Dirty Harry. “don’t cry in front of the mexicans” Bruce Lee: ""**HI-YA**!""

Cliff: ʰᶦ⁻ʸᵃ I really expected the climax to be Sharon Tate's murder. I was happily surprised by Brad's brutal beatdown. (triple alliteration btw) I gotta say, definitely taken aback when the hippie girl offered to suck Cliff off while he drove her home. And he asks to know if shes 18. Obviously she wasn't. Cliff was such an interesting character. Not saying Rick wasnt, just Cliff seemed more entertaining I can't believe there was a shot of Cliff getting stuff out of his trunk and we didn't get a camera shot from inside the trunk! I really loved the whole Spahn Ranch scene. Cliff pushing his way into their place without knowing how much of a threat they are really put me on the edge of my seat. Really felt like shit could’ve popped off any moment.  That being said, I wish we got more of Damon Herriman as Manson besides just the one scene, was really looking forward to his performance. [deleted] I loved that Sharon Tate’s real performance was used in the movie clips. It was a very nice touch. RIP Sharon. Add Cliff Booth to the ever-growing list of Tarantino characters that are just straight up fucking *cool* Brad Pitt plays ""cool, quiet, confidence"" so perfectly.

Any other actor would come off as smug or unlikable but he's so darn charming and fun. You aint giving my man Cliff Booth road head without showing your ID first. Tim Roth (Cut) How is nobody talking about the little girl on the movie set with Leo? I thought that scene was awesome and she plays the part really well That little girl is a very good actress. Most child actors aren’t that convincing and she shared the screen with Leo suprisingly well. That ranch scene with Cliff was intense. Tarantino would make a fucking awesome horror movie. I adored the backdrop of this movie. The streets of LA that have been converted to look like the ‘60’s are just stunning. The shots of Brad Pit driving in his car are gorgeous, especially the nighttime shots. The production design and sets are also great. I know it’s largely to be expected, but it’s just a beautiful movie. “Oh my god, is everyone okay?”  

“Well the fucking hippies ain’t.”  
  

That third act was the most Tarantino shit I’ve ever seen........ and I loved every minute of it. Holy shit. When Rick ran to the tool shed to grab the flamethrower to burn Sadie. Did not expect that. The last act was hilarious **Easy Breezy** was the most badass cowboy in the land, until he took a bad fall and hurt his *hip*.

They made it clear to show us few times at the end that **Cliff Booth** was stabbed...in the *hip*.

Cliff Booth was Easy Breezy in the long run, and the true cowboy of the film.

Fucking genius. ""I am the devil and I'm here to do the devil's work.""

""Naw, it was dumber than that."" This is the all time peak we have in foot fetish cinema. Bravo, Tarantino. I I know I just saw the film, but that absolute beat down that the Manson family got in the third act might be my favorite Tarantino scene. That whole ranch scene gave me the heebie jeebies The discussion about the role of violence in Tarantino's world and the criticism he faces for it in the media have a cheeky rebuke from Tarantino in this movie. 


At one point when Booth is driving the radio has a small segment about the Kennedy assassination and how it was the work of a truly deranged and dangerous person. One of the Tate murderers tries to justify their actions with a narrative that Tarantino's IRL critics have tried to take that the violence in media is what has taught them to be murders however Sebring and Tate are also big fans of Dalton's fake Hollywood violence and are perfectly normal people who enjoy it as the fiction it is.

 This makes a distinction that the worst violence is carried out by sick and demented people like the Tate murderers and fictional violence has little to no role in making them the terrible people that they were. (A similar parallel to me IRL is how the Columbine killers happen to be fans of violent video games and music, not that it made them violent) I imagine it was no coincidence that the particular murderer who tries to justify it is the one who gets the spectacular death by flamethrower. I've never done acid but I absolutely loved the way Brad Pitt played that experience. I swear he is actually one of the funniest actors out there. [deleted] This film really felt like it was all about placing the audience in the world it creates, and in that sense it is a master class. My only complaint is that I would have liked a bit more of a narrative thrust to enjoy. All in all I can't fault the film that much and enjoyed it just fine. Was that Uma Thurman’s daughter at the end of the movie? Quentin’s next movie will be about preventing 9/11 Brad Pitt stole the movie in my opinion. He was able to emote so well with what seemed like so little. It really reminded me of that old-school type of protagonist. Very James Dean-ish which given the subject matter of the film is probably intentional on Tarantino’s part Anyone notice that right before the Manson family comes to their houses at the end the guy in Sharon Tate’s house turns on he TV and the guy on TV says “And here is the moment you’ve all been waiting for.” A little meta line that I thought was fun. ""What was your name again?""

""I am the Devil. Come to do the devil's bidding""

""...Naw. It was stupider than that.""

I have never genuinely laughed harder at a line in cinema than that one. Bravo Cliff. Bravo Quentin. Manson's forgettable cameo was intentional.

Tarantino didnt wanna pay the character any screen time outside of a boring uneventful scene. Man...just give Brad Pitt the best supporting Oscar. People keep complaining about Sharon Tates presense in the movie. Sharon Tate was in the film to torment us because she was supposed to be tortured and killed in a most heinous way. The twist at the end was how the real scenario should have panned out.  It's a fairy tell that we all knew the ending to but got the ending we really wanted.  The murderers got what they deserved and that's what we wish happened in real life. DiCaprio's acting was amazing.  He and Tarentino make a great team.  He was so scary in Django. I thought GTA V was just a videogame, or that Quentin doubled down on it. Things include: drive around around LA listening to the radio, pick up prostitutes, engulf in flames your opponents by your multimillion dollar mansion poolside. Regardless of how much money this movie makes, who gets awards, or how divisive it will be. It was so nice to sit and watch an original movie that I didn’t know where it would take me. So refreshing during the summer blockbuster season. And not having to see a Hobbs and Shaw trailer beforehand was the cherry on top. When Brad Pitt was about to fight Bruce Lee.

>""What for?""

This movie was hilarious, and I absolutely loved it. Our theater lost their shit when he walked in with the flamethrower lmfao Brad Pitt chucking Bruce Lee into a car is one of my favorite movie moments of 2019 Holy shit that third act was absolutely phenomenal. I also really appreciate how tasteful Tarantino was with Sharon Tate. Rick on Cliff: ""Hell, you can hit him with a fuckin' Lincoln!""

Cliff to Bruce Lee: \*Throws him into a Lincoln\* I love how Rick Fuckin Daltons first instinct when a stranger falls into his pool is to grab a flamethrower he has chilling in his pool shed and torch the shit out of them Didn’t think any kill could top John Wicks library kill this year but Brad Pitt heavily injuring the girl with a can of dog food, then having his dog munch on her and having Leo finish her off with a flamethrower is the best kill in cinema I have seen in my life.  Not to mention the loud clank noise in Dolby Atmos sounded so nice Brandy deserves a big, fat steak after eating those crazy hippies. The girl Rick impresses on set is so goddamn good. Love that scene. Definitely need to see this again but my initial take away is this really felt like an homage to Sharon Tate. The way Robbie is shot throughout almost feels like she moves in her own orbit almost in slow motion compared to the other characters. The scenes where Tate is watching herself in The Wrecking Crew, using the actual footage of Tate instead of superimposing Robbie or re-shooting the scenes with Robbie, really romanticized the era and Tate specifically. I can't even really express right now the dread I felt leading up to the finale. Obviously Tarantino has no problem reinventing history but I really didn't know what to expect. It almost felt sickening imagining what was just around the corner, only for it to end the way it did. Which was incredibly enjoyable yet bittersweet at the same time. Also DiCaprio and Pitt were both phenomenal. I could easily see these two as serious contenders come Oscar season. When Brad Pitt fucking yeeted the dog food can at that chick's head I just about died. I did not expect the funniest movie scene this year to be the Manson murders. Also I think Tarantino should be applauded for making a movie essentially about the Manson family,or at least heavily to do with them, and only barely having Charles Manson in the movie This might sound insane but this was my FIRST Tarantino movie! 

I know that sounds fucking insane but I was too young to have taken his movies seriously. 

So, this was a fucking RIOT and I loved the Brad Pitt scenes at the end. My sides hurt watching that whole sequence. 

Gonna go watch it again just for that final act.

I do think the first 2 hours were kinda slow (still hilarious dialogue) but that seemed intentional with how bonkers the last 20 minutes were.

and OMG Margot Robbie was so cute This might have my favorite Brad Pitt performance of all time, and a great one from Leo too. But the best scene to me was Sharon Tate watching her own movie. That exuded such pure heart and charm. That scene alone to me was enough to see the critiques about Sharon Tate's lack of dialogue in this movie were kind of bs, not to mention her generally being the heart of the movie. [deleted] Brad Pitt acting high on acid while killing the Manson family members was absolutely  hilarious and absolutely brutal I loved, loved, loved the twist ending. 

I was dreading the climax because of what I thought it would depict—the horrific, senseless murder of a sweet, innocent pregnant woman and her friends. Showing her graphic murder in film would have been like killing her again, revictimizing her in grisly torture porn-like fashion. 

Instead of inflating the glory of some cowardly murderers, Tarantino chose to show just how pathetic they were. He refused to gratify the people out there who still idolize the Manson family. We get to see what should have happened, and as the movie ends, Sharon Tate is happily inviting her friends and neighbor into her home.

She may not have had that chance in real life, but at least we got to see her happy ending in a big, star-studded movie. I left the theater with a feeling of lightness mixed with melancholy. It was a bittersweet fairy tale. 

I also appreciated that neither Charles Manson nor Roman Polanski got much screen time or focus. 

Finally, the young girl who played Leo’s costar on set was awesome. She was the highlight of the first half of the movie for me.

EDIT: Whaaaat thank you /u/milfof2queens !!! The scene with Sharon Tate watching her own movie in the theatre and being happy people are laughing at her scene was one of the best things I’ve seen. I also loved how they showed her training with Bruce for her scene to show she’s dedicated to her craft. Absolutely beautiful I think Tarantino hates the Manson family even more more than he hates Nazis. You can tell how much he relished the opportunity to give them insanely gruesome and protracted deaths. But considering how much he loves Hollywood and this era in American history, it makes sense that he completely despises the people who did so much to kill the counterculture and the innocence of Hollywood that he remembers from his childhood. 

The fact that the people who actually stop the Mansons are Hollywood professionals is key to the point of the film. If Basterds and Django were revenge fantasies about Jewish people and slaves inflicting retribution against Nazis and slave owners, then this is his revenge fantasy about Hollywood itself getting retribution against the Mansons. One small detail I loved about the film: I figured Pacino's character would be the typical anti-semitic Jewish agent character you always see in these movies. He wasn't : he was a good agent, he gave good advice to his client, genuinely cared about him, (he even watched his FBI) and more than fulfilled his promises to get him some parts on Italian films. 

I liked how he explained the pro-wrestling model of putting someone over to Rick- he understood the business, he wasn't just some out of touch old greedy sleazebag. Slow burn of a movie until the end. Flamethrower fans rejoice. I think this film will be a super controversial one but I think this is just how Quentin Tarantino is using his trope of rewritten history to give the movie a whole new level of meaning that’s never been done before.

 It seems like Margot Robbie’s character does nothing but I think she’s the most important part for that new, experimental dimension of the film. Going into it you know she’s supposed to die (at least in real life) so you watch waiting for clues that lead to her death but you really just see her living life because in real life, that’s how it went. There wasn’t clues. She was just living her life and then everything ends abruptly. She’s got a bunch of things going for her, and thinking about her as a human, it’s actually really nice to see a girl doing well in her industry and being able have all the things she ever wanted: Fame, fortune, being loved by the public.  And the idea that she might die the whole time makes it seem a little grim. But when she doesn’t die, and everything ends up going well for everyone, like how cliff got redemption for what he’s done, Rick dalton got his role with the hot young director, and Sharon Tate gets to live, there’s a sense of relief because it ends with a pleasant, happy ending— contrary to real life. 

The fact of it having a happy ending is kind of referenced in the title- once upon a time in Hollywood. This is like a fairytale opening. Not only does it foreshadow a happy ending but also has statement of how this doesn’t happen in real life. It’s a fairytale. I think a lot of people will not get it because for most movies, they exist in a vacuum. Everything in the movie usually is all you should  need to understand it but I think Tarantino tries to break that status quo by writing this story to be paired with the real historical events. The way that real life’s not so happy ending foils the movie’s happy ending adds a new level of depth that’s confusing because of how unexplored and and on the frontier of the art it is. When you look at Sharon Tate’s happy life in the movie and realize what actually happened, you start to feel sad for her and how her life could have gone. From the one dimensional view on everything that happened in the movie it is a seemingly confusing plot, but because of the way history effects the meaning of the events, there is a whole new level of depth that has barely if ever been explored intentionally in a well known piece of literature.

The idea that it was meant to be paired with the real story gives his rewriting history a purpose other than to be a part of the story. In this movie he isn’t just rewriting a history to make his universe different from real life, its to have a commentary and provide a new perspective on real life events that looks past the crazy, scandalous narrative. The way this foil calls attention to the fact that it’s just a story makes you realize that all these good things didn’t get to happen to real people and that what really did happen is much sadder. Everything actually came out for the worst. 

This may be a completely new device  that we’re watching unfold and it may have been what Tarantino intended to do with inglourious basterds but we were all too dazzled by the brilliant storytelling, cinematography, acting, editing, writing, and directing of to be able to see, but it makes me really want to rewatch both inglourious basterds and once upon a time in Hollywood so I can see through this lens again, this time while watching.

I give it a 10/10 for this bold experiment and everything else was phenomenal too The theatre was *howling* when Rick walked out of his shed So I was actually getting invested into the western show they were making. Had me laughing when he explained to the cops ""he's saying he is  the devil"" I feel so conflicted. Did I actually like the movie? Was it actually one movie or was the first 2/3 one movie and the last 1/3 totally a different one? Was the ending rushed? Was all the extra footage in the beginning necessary? Was it even good? I'm baffled. I think I need to watch it again. I tried so hard to catch little details throughout the film that I think I wore my eyeballs out. And awaaaay we go Cliff Booth is this generations The Dude. Except Cliff can seriously fuck you up when he’s tripping on acid. Easily one of the best Tarantino scenes of all time! What a fun night for Brandy! A nice walk, good dinner, chew up some hippies and then got to cuddle with Fancesca. What a good girl. The man likes feet, dirty feet. I honestly feel the 3rd act would have such little meaning if you went into the movie without any hint of knowledge regarding the real events. Love it when Tarantino rewrites history to let the good guys fuck up the horrible people of our past, and the Manson family totally deserved every punch, kick, stab and flamethrower. What a fucking ending... [deleted] This movie was like watching someone play GTA who mostly just cruises around exploring for 3 hours. Something I really appreciated was how at the end when Tex is doing his ""psycho"" talk, which he is doing deliberately to seem sinister and to scare Cliff, but it is just not having ANY impact what so ever.

Then Cliff, high as a kite, is just laughing at Tex uncontrollably. Then we see this brief moment in Tex's face, where he realizes his own attempts to appear unhinged and crazy, as a means to strike fear in others while pointing a gun, is being outmatched by a guy laughing at him while holding a can of dog food and pointing a finger gun.

Tex escalates his own laughter in a very brief ""psycho laugh battle"" only to be defeated. 

It's such a great moment. I love how Tarantino uses it to mock the Manson family as stupid psycho babble idiots. Did anyone notice the weird cut between when Leo was talking to Timothy Olyphant? Where it suddenly cut from Timothy without a hat to with one? The whole damn movie I kept thinking “please don’t let Cliff get caught in a shootout” I've seen some complaints about how laidback and simple the movie is up until the final act, and although I see where they're coming from I loved it. It's been quite a while since a Tarantino movie felt so patient and character driven (at least since Jackie Brown, I would say, but maybe never?). This isn't a movie that's constantly showing off or rushing to hit plot points. The large majority of the events of the movie take place in one afternoon! Three complete little stories are told in one afternoon.

\- Practically the entirety of Dalton's plot up until the final act is him shooting a single TV episode. He gets to the lot, he gets into costume, has a few drinks, has a meaningful convo with a little girl, struggles shooting one scene and then knocks another scene out of the park. That's it! But from those few simple events a full story is told. He begins the day uncertain about his talent and future career. He shows up hungover/drunk, wanders around while being treated like a working actor rather than a star, and takes a moment to fantasize about a big break he never got (that scene from the Great Escape). He has that conversation with the young actress where he gets emotional about being a has-been and then has a lot of trouble remembering his lines when he shoots the episode, showing how heavily that is weighing on him. He has a mini-breakdown in his trailer but manages to psych himself up enough to nail the final scene with Luke Perry. And he gets vindicated as an actor with talent when the producer guy and the young actress tell him how great of a job he did. So we have Dalton walking into an uncertain situation, struggling with his obsolescence, running into a serious professional crisis and then managing to turn it around and prove to himself that he has worth. It's a full emotional journey in a simple afternoon. Add in the subtle, never-discussed detail about Dalton having a stutter (and think about how much more hard work he would have put into his career) and you have a really well-rounded character.

\- Sharon Tate does even less! She picks up a hitchhiker, goes to buy a book for her husband and then goes to see a movie she was in. But Tarantino accomplishes so much with these simple little scenes. We see how generous and kind she is (she strikes up an immediate friendship with the hitchhiker and goes to buy a gift for her husband just because), how unpretentious she is (see how polite she is with the theatre staff and how she just kind of adorably dances around everywhere she goes) and how she's clearly in an early ""honeymoon"" stage of her career where she's still not used to the idea that she's famous. Add in how radiant Margot Robbie is and you just fall in love with her immediately. It adds an emotional factor to the inherent tension in knowing about her real-life murder and makes you really want her to get out alive. It's because of this portrayal of Tate that this movie feels like Tarantino's most tender and sweet film: the movie almost feels structured around giving her the happy ending she never got in reality.

\- There's more to Cliff's story because it's setting up him as a badass and he's our conduit into the Manson family but Tarantino still takes his time with him. Tons of long scenes of him aimlessly driving around LA, which immerses us into the world of the film, and that long scene where he comes home and preps a meal for him and his dog. We learn so much about him just by panning around his trailer, making him feel like a human being rather than purely a super badass movie character. That and Pitt is just so effortlessly charismatic.

So for me the patient pacing of the movie is one of its strongest features. I loved just hanging around and getting to know these people and it made the ending that much more impactful. Brad Pitt’s deadpan delivery is on another level.

His comedic timing in general. Wow. The theater lost its fucking mind during that >!ending scene where Brad Pitt beats the living shit out of the Manson Family with a dog food can!< So did anyone pick up on the fact that Cliff’s wife was named Natalie? 

This has to be a reference to the [suspicions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood)  that Robert Wagner killed his wife Natalie Wood on a boat.

Edit: typo Dont cry in front of the Mexicans... Maybe I'm reaching here, but I had a thought and I want to share it.

When Rick is first on the set of Lancer and he's talking to the super intense 8 year old method actor, he badly describes the story of western novel he's reading.

In the novel, the bronc buster (which is historically an interesting profession by itself, filled with both charlatans and real quiet professionals [and also one of the most difficult careers a man could have in the west]) is supposed to be a real, honest to goodness tough as nails cowboy. But then, he takes a fall and hurts his **hip.** Rick says that he ""doesn't become a cripple or anything"" but that he's kind of messed up and just stops being as useful as he used to be.

Rick, the movie cowboy, obviously identifies with the character and has an emotional reaction. He has a hard time coping with the fact that he's not as good as he used to be, but he takes that and pulls his movie career together and moves forward.

Meanwhile, Cliff, the actual cowboy (or, the closest thing to a cowboy left in Hollywood) is *really good* at a difficult and demanding job that nobody appreciates, but he just wants the chance to work. As he says in the beginning of the movie, his job is to (I'm going to paraphrase) ""Carry Rick's load."" He carries Rick and Rick's crap, literally and figuratively, throughout the entire movie, until the climax where Cliff takes one last fall for Rick, where he injures his hip in a way that will almost certainly make him unable to work or be ""as useful"" as he once was.

For years, Cliff is basically just Rick's shadow until the moment where Cliff crosses over and gets to be the real hero one more time and he does so without any desire for attention or praise. He moves into his useless period with grace and tact, unlike Rick who suffers from constant emotional turmoil.

There's probably more to write and I could have said that better, but whatever. I just think the connection between the hip injuries is interesting, as are the parallels between the life Rick pretends to have and the life Cliff actually has.

I saw a number of articles about how this movie is supposedly about the Manson murders, or Sharon Tate, or whatever else. It's not really about any of those things. I think they're just convenient props for the set- and there's nothing wrong with that. Movies crib from reality all the time, and that little dose of reality is something that makes many films much better. The movie is really about the two men coming to terms with the end of their utility, especially in a way that coincides with the ends of what they represent.

One could make the argument that Rick represents the end of the TV and movie Western era, while Cliff represents the end of the actual American West. While Rick leaves with a whimper, Cliff sinks into the background but maintains his pride and his dignity.

Also, a fun fact, the dog that played Becky got an award for her performance, making her not only a good doggo, but an award-winning doggo. In true Tarantino fashion, he alluded to having difficulties with her on set, but was amazed by the quality of her performance while editing. I'm surprised that there were no closeups of the dog's feet.

Also, I thought the Ray Bradbury ""The Illustrated Man"" reference was interesting. The collection of short stories is framed by a man who is captivated by the tattoos that move around a man's body, telling stories in the process.

Ray Bradbury also had a deep love of 1950s and 60's Hollywood. Despite his warnings about mass media and television consumption, Bradbury wrote lovingly about California and Hollywood in a number of stories. Brad Pitt is slowly becoming Robert Redford, Leonardo di Caprio is turning into Jack Nicholson, and Margot Robbie is the spitting image of Jaime Pressly.

All the actors were at the top of their game. Quentin Tarantino killed it.

I enjoyed every minute of the movie! Not my favorite Tarantino film but man, its like a mixture of Jackie Brown and Inglorious Bastards. That in which is a mixture of fantastic dialogue of scenes that loosely tell the narrative of what's happening with a event of pretty traumatic significance (killing Hitler vs the Manson murders). I loved the performances, especially Brad Pitt. Leo was fantastic but IMHO Pitt really shined through the most. I personally really enjoyed the little moments building up to perhaps the best 20 minutes that Tarantino has ever made at the end. Its definitely gonna be on my rewatch list soon. My only gripe is the 2nd act while good could had been built better. But man that 3rd act is PHENOMENAL. Loved the feel of the 60s, soundtrack was great, and all the little side performances were great too I can’t believe the trailer meltdown scene was all improv and Leo’s idea. Holy shit that is amazing! fucking loved that scene, burst out laughing. Brad killed it, when he revealed he bought an acid laced cigarette I knew it was going to come back to that full circle, and it paid off so well. What was your name?

I’m the devil and I’m here to do the devil’s work!

...nnnnnnnnno it was something much dumber than that... brad has definitely done acid, when he first started waving his hand and seeing tracers i was drawn back immediately to an acid trip

i appreciated that scene so much After seeing this, I could watch a 2hr 45 min movie of just Brad Pitt being on acid. Mine was “Don’t cry in front of the Mexicans.” [deleted] Couldn’t stop at 3 whiskey sours? You fuckin had to have 8! [deleted] ""You embarrassed yourself like that in front of all those god damn people!""

Me when I think about awkward shit I did in middle school that doesn't matter anymore. and all that for Spahn to be alive...  good twist from tarantino That was Dakota Fanning?! Wow. Her close up & dialogue was kind of intense.. she fit the unhinged, barefoot cultist role that makes you feel uneasy down to the T. ""Im one pool party away from starring in polansky's next film""

He made his own pool party! When he asks him if he wants to watch his ep of FBI, and Cliff already has a sixer in the back. Absolutely beamed at that part. Yes! I just love how there was no cliche scene where either one was resentful of the other Their chemistry was great and they both nail their roles. Super entertaining to watch . They could easily make this into a 10 hour TV show I fully expected him to die, especially once he was stabbed I thought that was the end. The entire movie was just building up the tension all the way to the end. I was fully expecting to have to watch the murders as they really happened. Instead we got one of the best cathartic releases I can remember. I thought they were gonna shoot DiCaprio and Brad Pitt would hear the shot and find him dying. 

Really glad it didn’t go there. I think at this point he leans into it.  Fuck the first 40 minutes I was like, ""Goddamnit Tarantino!  I came here to see three things!  Lengthy dialogue, bloody violence and FEET!"" I took my sister to see this movie. She has never seen a Tarantino movie before and doesn't know anything about him. Even she was like ""What was with all the feet!?"" after we walked out of the theater. The shot of the feet pressed up against the car windshield had my friends and I rolling. Like, I guess that foot-fetish joke is so well-known at this point that all he can do is lean into it. [deleted] As promo some of the posters were put up on Sunset Blvd in Hollywood She had the nastiest food lol What a good dog she would be brandy stole the damn show I was so worried the dog was gonna die I’m pretty sure the dog was a good boy though. Also, who was that little girl actress? She was so good, especially in her conversation with Rick about his book. and then the immediate genuine joy in his eyes when the little girl whispers ""that was the best acting i ever seen"" Better acting in that scene than anything in The Revenant in my opinion. Honestly makes me wish Tarantino would do his own western series. That and Leo's delivery there was killer, he turned a spaghetti western trope into a genuinely scary and compelling villain. I'd watch that show. And also have dirty fucking feet My wife snores, so I felt that. Read a review that said this was misogynistic. Woof. Should be a commentary track on the Blu-ray with them in character QT has said he’s written a number of fake Rick Dalton episodes. Fuck, I’d kill to see them with their commentary. “Ain’t nobody safe with Rick Dalton walking around with a shotgun” ""I love that shot""

I liked that comment cuz I couldn't tell if he was referring to the camera angle with the broken windshield or the actual shot as in the bullet Leo's character had just fired. It was so perfect because it’s the exact conversation actors have when they watch their own shit On that last line, “now...that’s not verbatim” hahaha When being offered a hit from the dipped acid cigarette.

“My booze don’t need no buddy” 

I love that line! “Burnt her to a crisp”

“You could stop at 3 or 4 you had to ahve fucking 8 whiskey sours” “They said they were doing... devil shit, not verbatim but still” To take the air out of such an iconic phrase used in real, horrible, brutal murders was fucking legendary Aaand away we go! Then the Italian wife got a punch in there too lol She got hit so fucking hard from that dog food, I was howling I loved the small stutters and affectations he was doing throughout.  Really subtle but added so much to Rick's character. The hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do is act like I’m acting. Leo put on a clinic for any aspiring actors. I’m speechless. This has been an incredible decade for Leo. 

Inception (Elevates the whole film) 
Shutter Island
Django (Incredible, underrated) 
Wolf of Wall Street (Gonna be an All-Timer)
The Revenant (Oscar)
And now this. I loved the image of an angry drunk actor in the middle of the night holding a blender full of margarita and yelling at the Manson family to get the fuck out of his driveway, as much as if not more than Pitt's big beatdown.  And I just love that in this universe, the Manson murders were thwarted by these two dudes on the night that they both decided to get more buzzed than either of them had been in a while. The scene where he gets the TV scene right shows Leo's range and was one of the favorite scenes for me. Was him “killing” his wife supposed to connect to Natalie Wood somehow? That scene was like 5 mins long and then it flashes back to cliff on the roof and I fucking lost it. I had no idea it was a flashback 😂😂 I loved that it didnt start to kick in after he got back to Rick's house. That light scene was priceless Brad Pitt has obviously done acid before because he got it spot on. Brad Pitt’s “Huh” as he watched the dog food plop into the bowl while fucked up on acid was the most Brad Pitt moment in the film. This was like the complete opposite of what happened to Brad in Burn After Reading. To be fair the driving scenes, especially the nighttime ones, were very well shot When you live in LA a big part of your life becomes driving around it Please go see it...

...and bring bagels. I was losing it just watching the police officer stand there listening to her ramble on and on in Italian having no fucking clue what she was saying And then the way she shrieked and jumped before she ran away when the girl got up with the knife. ""I know you what's your name?""

""I'M THE FUCKING DEVIL""

""Naw, something dumber than that."" Just the most perfect line for Cliff to hear while tripping That line is so ridiculous and also super funny at the same time And the tension at the ranch Lol yup! Beyond the inglorious basterds reference Antonio Margheriti was actually an Italian Director MarGARettti Which scene? That girl he torched, her acting was wild as well. The greatest use of Chekhov's Gun I've ever seen I was fucking dying lmao Our entire theater went nuts when he walked out with it. Absolutely incredible. Might be in my top 5 favorite scenes Tarantino has directed. A lot of people (here anyway) seem to know a ton about Tarantino movies, and next to nothing about the movies/stories/people Tarantino is actually referencing/inspired by. That and the audio recording of Rick doing a stereotypical Mexican accent while practicing his lines were great Was there a reason that Bruce Lee was portrayed like that? He seemed like a complete jackass. Was this consistent with how others viewed him at the time, or just some word Tarantino flair? Throwing the dog food can was fucking legendary Brad popped the fuck off. It was insane lol I had a good feeling Quentin wasn't going to end the movie on such a horrible note. This is the man who killed off Hitler in Inglorious Basterds after all. It’s almost a shot at Polanski. I thought it was a way of establishing Cliff as old-school, not buying into the whole hippie movement, even when he has a hippie chick throwing herself at him. “Officer, I can explain. She may be 16 but the actress playing her is 24, so how was I supposed to tell?” [deleted] We should have shotguns for this job. I’m surprised we didn’t have a Samuel L. Jackson cameo :/ What made this more tense for me is that the first person the Manson family killed was a stunt man and it was on Spahn ranch. I was on such fucking edge waiting for that shit to pop off but I’m glad he lived to give us that ending. The interview with the cops later had me in stitches The guy behind me said to his wife ""That's the real Sharon Stone."" Loved how it showed the work that went into her fight scene, and then how pleased she was at the audience's enjoyment.

Showing Sharon in such a pure light is probably why her family was ok with this film. Honestly I don't know who to credit more for making me absolutely love someone who likely killed his wife and got away with it, Pitt or Tarantino. also this: Based on a real friendship between stuntman Hal Needham and Burt Reynolds. As badass as it gets.

[https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a28504994/brad-pitt-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-character-true-story-stuntman-hal-needham/](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a28504994/brad-pitt-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-character-true-story-stuntman-hal-needham/) Don't forget he murdered his wife though. Well it's really impressive, because Tarantino and Pitt had to balance the fact that he's a menacing figure with a dark past with the fact that at heart, he's a good-hearted moral person. Prisons been trying to get me my whole life. When it finally does, it ain’t gonna be because of you. My boys got standards Be cool, honey bunny I lost my shit when I saw that. That was the best acting I’ve seen in my whole life Julia Butters is awesome in American Housewife. She was great in this as well. One of the best child actors I have ever seen. Those whip-pan tracking shots showing how disgusting the Manson family’s house was with the TV blaring creepy ass music did it for me. Tarantino is a master at creating tension and I would love to see his take on the horror genre. Everyone is talking about the flamethrower scene but when Brad Pitt is throwing that red headed lady’s head against that mantle I lost it. Got to the third act and was like huh this really wasn’t as Tarantino as I expected it to be. Then that scene happened and I was like “oh. Yep yeah there it is”. Loved it so much My crowd was going nuts Also while Rick is busy trying to play the most genuine cowboy he can in a fake set, Cliff is out at Spahn Ranch living a real life western, walking through “town” being eyed by locals. Cliff Booth is the cowboy Dalton is trying so hard to be. Also explains why their opening credits were switched around in the car. Margot Robbie and Margaret Qualley both had feet scenes Lmao there had to be at least 5 difference scenes featuring prominent bare feet When I finally saw Margot Robbie’s feet I thought to myself “There they are!” and grinned to myself. It was too fucking good and satisfying Red Apple Cigarettes! Fuck me. I am tired of trusting these threads. It definitely wasn't as plot driven as some of his other scripts. Thematically, the Manson murders in many ways capped the end of an age of innocence and hope for the country and Hollywood and paralleled Rick's fading career (in the dying western genre) at the end of his personal era of superstardom and hope. The ending was asking what would happen if things it never ended and we could continue to live in a pre-tragedy fantasyworld.

Edit: In thinking about it, I wonder if the Manson family inhabiting and corrupting the Spahn Ranch, personifying its deterioration, is what prompted Tarantino to make Rick an actor in westerns. It's a perfect metaphor Yup! Maya Hawke. She was in Stranger Things 3. But only for the last 20 minutes, the first two hours will be about on office meeting taking place in one of the buildings The scene with him tripping acid trying to figure out what was going on was fantastic Agreed, he was magnetic and every time they went back to him was a breath of fresh air I felt bad for Leo. He acted the hell out of it like usual but just couldn’t get out of Brad’s shadow. It’s alright we’re gonna get more of him in season 2 of Mindhunter. Same actor and everything lol. Yup! You almost feel gypped till you realize we’re all better off without another charismatic/insane Manson speech. A nomination if anything. He better win the Golden Globe for comedic performances because that Acid Fight scene was COMEDY Supporting?? Cliff Booth was definitely the main character of the film. Fly down the road In Hollywood hills Oh my gosh I hadn’t realized until now how sick I had grown of seeing Hobbs and Shaw trailers before every movie I’ve seen during  the last 3 months. Thank you. This is exactly what I was thinking. This is what I absolutely love about Tarantino's movies. I always feel refreshed by their originality. I especially enjoyed this one. That whole scene was phenomenal. ""I didn't even l know that was your car six horse Judy"" Puts a dark spin on the ""anybody kills anybody by accident, they go to jail. It's called manslaughter"" trailer line [deleted] Yeah it the end was pretty insane when Rick was standing outside their gate and Sharon Tate’s voice sounds so calming and concerned for him, little did she know what happened in a different reality :( [deleted] a screaming hippie bitch wielding a knife\* Leo pulling out that flamethrower may be one of my favorite movie moments ever. ""Are you real?"" followed by incessant laughing got me too There were a lot of laughs in the theater, but that last act had every single person in attendance laughing hysterically. My wife laugh-snorted more times than I could count. What a good time. It’s amazing how talented she is. She can be seductive like in Wolf of Wallstreet, downright trashy in I, Tonya, and here she’s just a loveable giddy sweetheart That was my favorite part too, kinda just filled your heart with warmth. RIP Sharon Tate. She was so effective with just her expressions, Margot was brilliant. A dog, can, and your own fists are all you need Honestly that and Rick blowing up on himself and then NAILING the lines and improvisations for his next scene were brilliant to me. Really awesome character moments I especially liked that he juxtaposed it with Rick yelling at himself for being a drunk and not taking it seriously. Meanwhile, she’s quietly putting in the work. I absolutely marked out at the pro wrestling parallels. Not sure if that's a common theme in Hollywood casting as well but I thought of wrestling immediately. Yeah I swore it’d cut to him mocking his role in FBI when he was watching it but nope. He was honestly watching it and followed through as best he could for Rick. Can we do something about this heat? Holy shit, you just gave perfect voice to everything going through my mind right now. My brother asked what I thought and I said I need to a week to figure out if I liked it The whole time I kept waiting for something to click for me, it felt like there was too many stories that didn’t feel like they were leading anywhere, about halfway through the second act was when the movie finally felt like it was going to pay off. However, I really dig old time hollywood and felt like tarantino really immersed you in the world but sacrificed narrative. Not that that is a bad thing, but not what I expected going in. My wife had no idea what was going on.  I had to explain the Manson family to her in the drive home. Yeah it did it twice. It was intentional, not entirely sure why yet I think it was to imply that Timothy’s character was talking on end and annoying Leo Man golden age Hollywood was fucking weird. Like we talk about modern Hollywood being fucked but you could apparently get away with a shit load back in the day because I mean who the fuck would find out Ah Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, and... Jaime Pressley.

The true Hollywood trio. My favorite bit was (just came out of the theater) when you get sucked into the actual fake movie and Leo's character just shouts 'line!' and you realize you were ingrained in such a pointless scene of his real character fucking up a scene. Followed up by an amazing monolog of him being pissed at his alcoholism. Chekhov's cigarette. That one is going to get some mileage. Mine was ""My Booze dont need no buddy."" ""Real as a donut"" was mine. I saw it with a mostly Mexican audience. Everybody busted up at that. Whiskey Sours of all things! I loved how the mirror made his reflection look right at us. I think if he wins an award, it’s for that scene alone. At first it was funny then it immediately wasn’t. All of that tension just so she could have her George TV time.  
""What happens if she gets mad?""  
""Well.. nothing..."" ""You mean the redhead out front?""  
""Didn't I tell you I was fuckin' blind!? How do I know what hair color she's got?"" Good for Spahn getting his brains fucked out every morning. Is it really a twist when he's a real person? It wasn't Dakota Fanning.

It was Dacoteau Fanning. [deleted] Yeah, it was really nice. Like Cliff hung out with him because he was paying him, but he also really enjoyed his company And ordering pizza.

The bro-est of bro nights in. I loved their commentary while they watched that episode Same, got a big dumb smile on my face watching the scene. Honestly, I didn't expect Tarantino to go heartwarming territory but I appreciate moments like that. Cliff and Rick's friendship is one of the sweetest things I've even seen from him. They somewhat teased it with Cliff on the roof hearing in his head Rick's reason for him not getting the job. He looked like he was ready to question it and be resentful...    
but then we get the flashback to which Cliff laughs it off and says, ""fair enough"". I thought the girl that picked up the gun on floor somehow got an incredibly lucky shot or ricochet that lead to him collapsing and I just wasn't ready to accept that's how he died > I think at this point he leans into it.

Honestly, too much this time. It's to the point where we are beyond a 4th wall breaking nod and wink, and his fetish is just shattering right through. haha that feet on the windshield is a giant middle finger to everybody that won't shut up about the feet thing Same experience only with my roommate. Immediately asked me, “I liked it but was it just me or were there a lot of dirty feet in there?” Usually it’s just a scene or two but this one had at least 6 (Margot 3, Margaret 2, Dakota/hippies 1 yes I counted) I wonder if she preferred raccoon or rat The can *specifically* said it was good food for bad dogs. Must've been great with all those scenes of her licking her lips watch Brad Pitt open up the cans.... [deleted] Based on a couple articles, it’s was a female, Sayuri, for the acting and a male, Cerberus, for stunts. And according to their Instagram, the owners have bred them and puppies are expect in August. Julia Butters.  She’s also pretty good in an ABC sitcom called American Housewife. If he doesn’t get a nomination, we riot. Rick fucking Dalton well i think the dirty feet part was more or less just for just him And have armpit hair [deleted] I think he meant the camera shot because leo was making a weird face through the window and it was kind of ridiculous looking  in a funny way “Where is that, PCH?”
“Somewhere in Malibu”
Good actor chit-chat. the not verbatim line had me dying I fucking loved that Tarantino took what a group of fucking attention-seeking pieces of shit did and showed them for what they would have been had they confronted someone besides a bunch of actors and a pregnant woman. Watching them get demolished was the perfect revenge-porn moment for a real-life horror. So good! 

Rick was actually a fantastic actor when you see how he could snap into his role, no stutter or anything. 

If he’d had a bit more confidence in himself he could’ve had a much better career I noticed the slight stutters right away. It wasn’t too overt but just subtle enough to feel real and truly show the characters growing lack of confidence. I thought it was hilarious that Rick managed to scare the fuck out of Tex Watson. I mean, he was a little shaky when he was talking to Cliff, but he was absolutely in shambles when Rick was berating him. Not only that, when they get to the bottom of the hill they collectively geek out that they just saw Rick Dalton from Bounty Law. Yes!!! You nailed it. I just wrote above it was a clear homage to Natalie’s mysterious death and wide speculation that her husband did it. Him looking back in admiration of himself made me cackle He was _fascinated_ by that can opener. His reaction to the dog food plopping into the bowl was hilarious. The best part of that was it wasn't shot from his perspective.  It's so cliche to do weird movie shit to show the character's perspective is fucked up, but it's much funnier watching Brad Pitt just trippin' out. Definitely! I was cracking up that whole time because he nailed it. I was really hoping he was gonna survive the whole thing. Even though he killed his wife he just seemed like such a good guy. I was thinking that Leo was gonna die at the end too when she was shooting blindly. Tarantino isn’t known to kill his protagonists, but he’s done it a couple times so I didn’t know what to expect. I loved the Cinema Dome lighting up Oh yeah you were on a horsey! His hesitation before that line makes it so much funnier. He was so unfazed by the whole situation. “They said they were doing... devil shit, not verbatim but still” that shit had me rolling. Yeah it definitely did not help reinforce reality. Dominic DeCoco The whole movie is the set up, the final scene is the punchline. Couldn't help but think of Kill Bill V2 during that scene Her speech in the car about killing the Hollywood ‘murderers’ was fantastic acting. I’m too young to understand the Manson vibe but she really made that vibe come to life He even calls it that earlier doesn’t he? Chekhov’s flame thrower Everyone in my theater was dying and cheering at the same time lol I imagine there are a lot of people who don't even realize ""The Great Escape"" was a real movie. ""Spanish, Spanish, Spanish"" Eh, QT obviously has a lot of love for Bruce, as anyone could tell from the Kill Bill movies, but Pacino pretty much explains the purpose of that scene to us right in the beginning. He's the heavy, put there to push Cliff as the sympathetic bad-ass protagonist. The notion that Lee was more a cocksure salesman than once-in-a-lifetime fighter isn't exactly new, so they played off the perspective a bit for the scene. They have them butt heads, both guys have a good moment proving their fighting ability, and then it ends in a draw. It all seemed in good fun to me, and I dont really see what the big fuss is all about. God damn they fucked that chick up so bad. She got her nose broken, bitten by a dog, thrown through glass, then barbecued Yeah lol that got an audible gasp from my audience, people were loving it. [deleted] I don't know how I didn't see it coming honestly. He did such a good job of convincing me this wasn't inglorious basterds through the whole movie I really thought it was gonna be dark. I was so happy he was able to surprise me with this. It's a bit of a shame that there wasn't more potshots taken at Polanski in the film, his character is barely in it. Shoots his bitch of a wife with a harpoon, you know, a real dude you can have a beer with. one black dude in the movie, for one second while Rick was filming [deleted] lol I turned to my friend and said ""that's Marilyn Manson"" when Charles Manson appeared on screen lol QT also made Sharon charming AF. The cute snoring, the dirty pretty feet, helping out a friendly hitchhiker, dancing along to music and always smiling. She was just adorable. It was really wholesome i credit the actor that played the wife

she did a bang-up job in just a few seconds of screen time ALLEGEDLY! remember when he said he was on a chain gang Thank you! ^I'm ^Rick ^FUCKING ^Dalton The opening with the Manson girls skipping around while singing and digging through the trash was a really unsettling image as well. I had gone into the movie assuming Brad Pitt would last until at least the last reel but by the time Cliff got to the front door of the main house I was watching through my fingers. I thought there was a good chance he wasn't getting out of there alive. The Mansons killed a few people for less, and not just at Cielo Drive. That whole scene of Cliff inside the house gave me real Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibes. Lol the dings when he slammed her head against the telephone I lost it when he beamed her in the face with the dog food can. First time I can honestly say I witnessed an entire theater laughing and applauding to a man brutally destroying a woman on camera... or when Leo roasts them all in the car, ""what the fuck are you lookin at you ugly ginger hippy fuck"" or it was somethin like that aha It started getting really into the 'historical drama' feel with the narrator showing up and everything, which I disliked until I realized it was lulling us into a false sense of history. I really didn't think the narrator fit the Tarantino style until it did a 180 straight into Tarantino style. When he busted out the flame thrower I think the theater all collectively came. >Cliff Booth is the cowboy Dalton is trying so hard to be.

Ooohhh shit He’s also makes a motion as if he was tipping his hat when the ambulance was pulling away. While also getting eyed by the locals, a dog runs by the deserted road similar to what a tumbleweed would do. Cliff also rattles his keys when he steps out of the car that reminded me of what a cowboy does when he puts his hand on his holster. On top of that, in the final scene, you have Dalton during the ""acting scene"" of yelling at the car. Then a ""cut"", followed by the ""action scene"" preformed by Dalton's stunt double, Cliff. this comment made me enjoy the movie more It totally could have some thematic meaning, but things like this have been done in the past (typically on movie posters) as a way to handle two actors that share top billing. 

We read from left to right, so if Brad Pitt is on the left of the screen (or poster) and so is his name, then Brad Pitt will be ""top billed"" by default, because you would see him *and* his name first. By showing both actors with the *opposite* actor's name superimposed on them simultaneously, it muddies who's supposed to be ""first"" -- so neither Dicaprio nor Pitt has top billing, they *both* do. [deleted] Had to be at least fifteen shots of dirty feet, but the one where she was watching her own movie and her feet were framed right next to her face, I could just tell Tarantino was rock hard filming that. [deleted] Now that I think about it, you could probably also  draw parallels with younger generation (Sharon Tate especially) finding their place in Hollywood while the Rick Daltons feeling lost in it as the age of westerns come to a halt. I'm pretty sure one of the actresses from Euphoria plays a Manson girl too. The one watching through the screen door. When he watches the dog food land in the bowl Dewey Crowe can't be held down Believe me, whatever Manson had to say at this time was NOT interesting or true.  At best, he’d be ramblin’ about how he and his family are going to live in underground desert cities after the coming race wars wipe out most of the world’s population. Just an FYI gyp/gypped is a racial slur you may want to avoid using in the future. Yeah he's clearly one of the two leads, arguably the main character. But I wouldn't mind trickery to get him a supporting nom. I don't remember the last time he was nominated. It really was! I loved how we all knew that Kurt Russell's character didn't want him there, and then the next thing he does is start a fight with the lead of the show and throw him into the side of her car. Then when it comes back to Cliff on the roof saying, ""fair enough"" lmao. Completely agree! She was such a sweet, caring individual. It's horrifying what happened to her and I'm so thankful the film didn't show any of that. Yeah that was the thing. He flipped revenge films on their head - the thing that you’re getting revenge for didn’t happen in the movie. 

But as He’s entering their house to live happily ever after, you realize how sad it is because that didn’t happen. Those 3 were brutally murdered. Very bittersweet. “Yeah it still works. Thank god.” wielding a gun and firing it into the air ""I'm as real as a doughnut"" literally tears 😂 love that she also played the opposite of Leo who was starting to become jaded and burnt out That’s the BEST scene by DiCaprio in the last few years, and he’s consistently good. There are so many layers and emotions he goes through, as both Rick Dalton and the character he’s playing. Absolutely flawless. Well...it’s a flamethrower [deleted] I preferred Checkov's pitbull. What a good dog. Having grown up in SoCal it’s not a bad piece of advice lol. ""Believe it or not, but I got a flamethrower in my tool shed"" Like, what the fuck. How'd that insane sentence come out as naturally as ""right as rain""? The fact he was putting egg whites in it to make it frothy was a nice touch. He's a bougie drunk. I've had too many nights where i got fucked up on homemade whiskey sours. Coulda been worse. Coulda been amoretto sours. It stayed funny for me. I get it got pretty dark but the way he was looking in the mirror and talking to himself yet made it look like he was addressing someone else was just magical to me. I just don’t like to disappoint her But he still hit that. Apparently Manson has his followers have sex with him.. I guess as some sort of repayment Doesn't matter, had sex?? lmao - bravo The end of the 60s I think I felt they had a mutual friendship before that, that he had been his stuntman for years before he became his 'gopher' and that him giving him that job was an extension of that friendship once it got harder for Cliff to get work after his wifes mysterious accident. Thats why the friendship came off so naturally. Man looking back on it...that feels really intentionally set up, because that was also the only moment in the film where I had even the slightest inkling that there would be a rift between them. I was so certain that, during that scene, the Polanski's would see cliff and cast him in a movie; setting off a chain of bitterness between Leo and Brad. Nope. Movie took the high road on that one. That flashback was so great. I loved the fight between Cliff and Bruce Lee. It looked like it was a single take right up until Cliff threw Bruce into the car door. Or when Rick says he was going to have to stop employing Cliff.  
Perfect setup for Cliff to be angry but instead he totally understands (and it *is* an understandable situation) and it's really a setup for ""one last night on the town"". Why become a filmmaker if you’re not going to flaunt your fetishes to an audience I would love to hear what Robbie has to say about shooting the feet scenes. Imagine the director known for a foot fetish telling you, “Yeah after that line we need a shot where you put your bare feet directly into the lens”. I’d be shook [deleted] Pretty sure my chick was doing the same when Brad Pitt took his shirt off on the roof. Actually, he does an interesting bit of dramatic staging with the feet that is integral to the story beyond any “author appeal.” 

Tate and Pussycat both put their feet up in the exact same manner while sitting. The theatre and car scenes come relatively close in the movie, so we’re supposed to draw a comparison between the innocent, joyful Tate and the seductive, sinister Pussycat. The two represent dual sides of late 60’s youth culture, and Pussycat is supposed to be double of Tate, much like how Booth is Dalton’s double. And may or may not be 18 I also like that they took the time to roast a few more Nazis. >had they confronted someone besides a bunch of actors and a pregnant woman. 

Also pretty amusing set up that the one who gets nailed with the can (Mikey Madison) gives that monologue-rant in the car about ""killing the people who taught us how to kill,"" then, instead of encountering Rick - who isn't a ""heavy"" in real life but just an insecure actor - they find his stunt double who can ACTUALLY kill people. Showing us the whole Dalton/Booth saga then dropping the Manson killers into it paid off SO well with that ending. Right!  The instant he messes up his line while filming his first Lancer scene you can literally watch the confidence drain out of him. That, and how he could smoke without coughing when he was acting. Wow just searched that, Christopher Walken was on the yacht too!?  Old Hollywood has some secrets I could totally watch another movie of that character.  Fucking brilliant job by Tarantino and Pitt to bring that guy to life.  I'm so curious about the wife thing.  They left it hanging if it was a drunken accident or if he couldn't put up with her anymore and just said to the hell with it. Hey, settle down, I'm doin the best I can given the circumstances ***WHOA*** I laughed the first time at his trailer! Tarintino doing only what he does best making a dog food can plop loud, gross and way too dramatic. Also the reaction was extremely realistic, not like having the dog talking to him or some shit. Like 3 moments in the film it felt like Cliff would die. 

1 When he went to the ranch and wanted to see George.

2 when the gun was pointed right at his head 

3 after he was stabbed and collapsed During the advanced screening of it in the Dome, this moment got a huge cheer from the audience. Bravo To be fair, I laughed my ass off One pool party away from starring in a Polanski film The girl who ran away with the car is actually Uma Thurman’s daughter. And it’s originally from a movie in which he burns Nazis from a balcony, thus alluding to Inglourious Basterds and its historically-inaccurate / historical-revanchist twist ending. This thing was super well-crafted. Oh my god Seeing Lee spar with Tate in her flashbacks made him more likeable too, and I think it's worth considering the idea that Cliff's memory of the fight would make him look better than the reality. There's probably an element of wish-fulfilling fantasy to it. Like, there's no way he would have actually dented a car like that, right? Good. Anyone who's read Helter Skelter or anything about the murders knows that Sadie Atkins deserved that shit. What she did to Sharon Tate is absolutely horrifying. Girls was absolutely insane. That whole scene was so goddamn satisfying to me. Really should have seen it coming with the “Once Upon a Time” title that this was a fantasy...but good lord I sure didn’t. When the title rolled at the end it clicked and I felt so stupid. It was right there the whole time! There were even ideal moments, like at the Playboy Party where he was the subject of gossip. Easily could've thrown an elbow, and it would've been pretty fair. Polanski is still active and has his defenders. Taking outright shots, especially in the context of his wife and child being murdered would have been in bad taste.

That said, I think the lines at the party about Tate, Polanski and Sebring kind of show what Tarantino thinks might happen if Tate had lived. She would have ultimately left Polanski once she saw the darkness within him, for Jay Sebring, who was always by her side. When I was young, I got my wires crossed somehow and though Marilyn Manson WAS Charles Manson.  Then one Christmas my cousin was talking about her love of Marilyn Manson, and I was very angry at her for idolizing a killer.  That got embarrassing fast. My friend saw Bruce Lee and said “is that supposed to be Jet Li?” I actually believed, for a little while, that Sharon was still alive. I was so sad for some reason when I realized she was actually dead. Played by Rebecca Gayheart! I don’t know if it’s intentional that he used an actress that also accidentally killed someone With the mural of the cowboy in the background i love that everyone prolly hated the hippies at this point Him still holding the can as they walked in, I just knew someone was gonna get hit with it. The anticipation was killing me. Looked like it hurt like a bitch and a half That 180 in itself is so Tarantino haha Except for the flame thrower scene, which Dalton specifically practiced for! Oh shit. Or the young method actress (even his acting technique was dying,) I forgot her characters name. They were all pushing him out. That's why that scene of her whispering to him was so amazing. He's still got it, just enough hope that maybe he can survive. Beautiful moment

Edit: ahem...actor not actress Yep, the one with huge tits, Cassie. Manson's race war fantasy is really an unique spin on the idea. Most white supremacist envision white people winning the race war. Manson was banking on white people being nearly wiped out with the exception of him and his hiding followers. I preferred Chekhov's flamethrower. As soon as I saw it in the shed (when Brad Pitt goes back to fix the antenna on the house) I knew it would have some use later!! right?  that was easily my favorite scene in the movie.  that and when Brad called Bruce Lee a dancer. lol She fucked his brains out They kept him drugged and Manson had his followers sleep with him to essentially keep him preoccupied while they took over his ranch. He actually gave her the nickname Squeaky (Spahn came up with all the Manson Family nicknames) because of the sound she would make when he pinched her upper thigh. Because people are listening to the radio throughout the movie? Damn Could be a mix of both, regardless it’s probably one of my favorite movie friendship During an interview she defended it, saying she likes being barefoot.  But I'm taking that with a huge grain of salt given it is a promotional interview.

If I'm bring honest though, I feel the only reason people think it's uncomfortable is because feet aren't considered a mainstream thing to sexualize.  Margot was full naked in Wolf of Wall Street but not too many people were accusing Martin Scorcese of using her image for gratification.  But everybody knows Tarantino as the Foot Guy because it isn't a mainstream thing to find sexy.  If his go-to device was nudity instead of feet I don't think he would be known as any sort of Guy. Most actors are honestly game for anything. 

See Margot Robbie insisting on being naked in The Wolf of Wall Street even though she was supposed to be in a robe in the script or every actor in Cats 2019. I know the 10th film is supposed to be his last but I could go for a whole anthology of film's centered around Tarantino just rewriting history. Yeah, he was. The speculation is
Chris and Natalie were having an affair and Wagner killed her. 

They actually re-opened the case a few years ago because of new evidence. 

Everyone’s confident Wagner killed her, just no concrete proof. I’m prepared to hear people I know IRL talk to me about this movie, saying it was boring or wishing it had more action. And honestly, just on his character alone, I fucking loved this movie. Him and DiCaprio together as well was fucking great. i think it was implied that an unexpected wave rocked the boat while she was standing in front of his harpoon gun and it went off.  I noticed during this scene that when she stands to yell at him, the boat starts rocking more, it rocks once or twice and then just as we cut to black, we hear a larger wave slap the side of the boat. I'm the Devil, and I'm here to do...Devil shit. It sounded so heavy too! It added to the weight when that fuckin’ hippie got nailed in the face with a can. She has had a good month. Sadie especially. I know that case well and any time people would reopen the question of 'should she be paroled?' in recent years (before her death) my answer was always fuckin' ***nope!***

It is extremely likely that it's true, the Manson girls were deprogrammed and rehabilitated after their long incarceration. They were once victims of Manson too. It is also true that I never, ever wanted Sadie or the others to get out. Her in particular I could never trust. It was a great attack on the mythos of the Manson cult. Busted that shit wide open. I hope Squeaky Fromme sees it. Yes, I thought it was going to end with the Tate murders. At the end when ‘Once Upon a Time’ came on the screen I was like duh....this is a fairy tale ending oh the true story. Yup! The ending just made sense once the title rolled in. 

Quentin Tarantino title sequences are always amazing. I think that ludicrous Austin Powers-esque  doily blouse was embarrassing enough. I figured the line about ""he's gonna do something to fuck it up"" was a jab at his eventual rape charges My girlfriend whispered into my ear and fucking said “omg it’s Jackie Chan!” And I completely lost it Whoa The mural was Giant. James Dean Well they also murdered a 8.5-month pregnant actress and used her blood to leave a message to her husband and were extremely racist in real life so... They made it look like her jaw got fractured/dislocated. Username checks out And then coming out to rule over the senseless/stupid blacks (even though they just wiped out a population far greater than their own and one that had much more power). Is there a good book or documentary about the whole actual events surrounding the ""Manson Family"", the tragedy at Sharon Tate's home and how it all affected Polanski? I've read a bit of the Wikipedia articles, but I guess there's better material out there.  
  
Tarantino made a fantastic inspirational crazy movie, but as there's a lot of fiction in it, mixed up with reality, he just assumes everybody knows the actual story in great detail, so he doesn't bother in the slightest to make it perfectly clear what it was. Which is fitting for his masterful style. Exactly. Radios are constantly on.  Until then. Tarantino portrayed a very genuine friendship in an almost impossible situation (boss and employer). A super feel like he's not going to stop directing films. I have heard it was Robert and Christopher that were having the affair... Well, it's much more clear once you realize who's driving the boat:

>**Cliff:** Oh, man, I shot Billie in the face!  
>  
>**Jules:** What!? Why the fuck'd you do that?!  
>  
>**Cliff:** Well, I didn't mean to do, it was an accident.  
>  
>**Jules:** Oh man, I seen some crazy ass shit in my time, but this...  
>  
>**Cliff:** Chill out man, I told you it was an accident, you probably went over a wave or something.  
>  
>**Jules:** Hey, the boat ain't hit no motherfucking wave.  
>  
>**Cliff:** Hey look man, I didn't mean to shoot the bitch, the speargun went off I don't know why. I think it implied that was a possibility, as much as it implied he was just fed up with her. I think he intentionally didn’t want us to know for sure That's how I took the scene, but I respect leaving it the way it was for interpretation.

He looked more tired/drunk than seething with anger. He had that kind of ""here we go again"" look and seemed to just be waiting out her rant, as opposed to a ""I can't take any more of this"" look, followed up by a homicide. “No. That wasn’t it. It was dumber than that.” It's crazy that she was able to film all of season 3 of Stranger Things and her part in this movie in just a month, that's some real commitment I tell ya what I heard women cheering and applauding when she was getting torn up by the dog, there was this older woman in front of me she was so happy to see her get killed it was like cathartic to her. So glad they went with the fantasy of seeing those evil folks physically pay. Leave it to Polanski to dress like a fucking *goober* to a party at the *fucking playboy mansion in 1969* But that was actually historically accurate to what he wore. Someone in my theater actually yelled out “oh behave!” lol >On June 13, 2001, while driving a vehicle owned by Italian actor Marco Leonardi (her From Dusk Till Dawn 3 co-star), Gayheart struck nine-year-old Jorge Cruz, Jr. as he walked across a street in Los Angeles. Cruz died the following day from his injuries. Gayheart paid the family $10,000 for Cruz's funeral expenses and was given permission by the family to attend the service, but ultimately chose not to. On August 7, 2001, Gayheart made her only public statement on the incident, in which she said: ""The pain of this tragedy will live with me forever. Despite the allegations in the lawsuit, the facts will establish that this was a most unfortunate accident."" On November 27, 2001, Gayheart pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter. She was sentenced to three years of probation, a one-year suspension of her license, a $2,800 fine, and 750 hours of community service. The parents of the boy filed a wrongful death lawsuit, which was eventually settled out of court. I love how Tarantino gives us history as we all wish things had turned out. It looked like it fractured/dislocated *her whole fucking face.* that shot was brutal and so satisfying considering who it was happening to.

Burn in Hell, Susan Atkins. “Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969.” - Joan Didion ""Like Rex or something?"" ""That's not verbatim."" To be fair she only has like two scenes for this movie I kind of wish Ted Bundy or Dahmer got this treatment. He looked like he was playing basketball with Prince against Charlie Murphy That just makes it more embarrassing. Right? Hitler and the Nazi high command dying in a fire/explosion as the result of two separate plots is still the best thing ever. Fuck me, where was that quote when I was writing my history paper on how the Manson murders signified the end of counter-culture. “You were on a horsey” To be fair, Dahmer was literally stabbed to death with a broken broom handle.

I like to think the pointy end went up his ass. Well, Ted Bundy got shocked so badly the top of his head cooked off, no? ",1
28,"For a Ryan Reynolds produced movie a lot of characters sure were open about how hot a character looking exactly like Ryan Reynolds is. The scene where she tells him to turn around and he's just like ""okay!"" And does a little spin with a stupid smile on his face had me rolling.

This was such a happy movie! Cheesy as hell and everything I expected it to be. I'm a sucker for Ryan Reynolds. Hey Keys, maybe be a bro and program a Millie into the game so Guy isn’t hanging around “unable to find love” forever Evans got the biggest reaction, but when Tatum first appeared at the beginning of the movie, the people beside me were debating if it was him or not. They lost it when it became pretty clear it was him. Still doesn’t beat his cameo in This Is The End though. I loved DUDE's unfinished nature. The T-shirt icon on his pectorals, his 'catchphrase', and the fact that Antwan convinced the Art nerds to just throw on a gold chain before anything else. Hilarious. Tired: “They referenced Marvel, Star Wars, Valve games, Mega Man, and Fortnite!”

Wired: “They referenced the [greatest movie scene](https://youtu.be/mikj8eDKxMQ) of all time.” Catchphrase! I loved the background stuff, there was one scene were a background player kept jumping into a wall and lagging around the place which I thought was so spot on. I even didn't mind the cameos from streamers/YouTubers either, I thought it was a real nice touch to include them. Was the guy Mills gets the info from then kills Hugh Jackman?? Ted Lasso and Free Guy being two successes during the pandemic really makes you think. 

Maybe the American people just want something wholesome and fun with the rough 18 months we’ve been through. 

I’m all for it You can see the exact moment Disney and Fox merged in this movie The Chris Evans cameo made me laugh Taika Waititi being in both The Suicide Squad (although more of a cameo) and Free Guy in consecutive weeks and both being great films. The Alex Trebek Cameo actually made me a bit sad I was not expecting that OFFICER JOHNNY!!!! I liked that Guy wasn’t the only NPC who was evolving. The barista and the bombshell companion character both had their own growth. Well that was about as god damn wholesome as it gets. As an immigrant in New Zealand, this movie definitely hit the ""kiwi cinema goers go wild for Taika Waititi showing up in a film"" that I've come to expect.

I really enjoyed it. It's a fun movie, with lots of homages to other movies, and a genuinely interesting story. Is it the best movie in the world? No. Does it need to be? No. I liked it more than I expected to, to be honest.

One of my favourite things about it was the friendship between Guy and Buddy. They could easily have had Buddy just stay as an irrelevant NPC that Guy outgrows when he realises he's an AI - but those guys genuinely really care for each other and Buddy is always there for him in ways I didn't see coming. I loved that at the end, the friendship between Guy and Buddy was given as much weight as (if not more than) >!the romance between Millie and Keys.!< There were quite a lot of kids in my screening, all of which reacted with laughs and such when the likes of jacksepticeye, DanTDM and Pokimane showed up. I thought it was cute.

Overall, it was a fun movie. Better than I was expecting it to be, honestly. The true hero of this movie is RTX reflections. Every time I saw what ""Free City"" looks like in real life it reminds me of those shitty mobile game ads that look/are nothing like the actual game. This is pretty much the best Saints Row movie or Grand Theft Auto movie ever made. “What the shit?!” Might be bold to say, but I think this is the best movie of the summer. A completely original film beating out a Marvel, DC, and F&F movie is no easy feat. Now we now those  shades in the matrix weren't just silly cosmetics I love Taika Waititi, but man I feel like that role was made for Aziz Ansari. I really enjoyed it and thought it did a great job at portraying a virtual game world vs reality without making up some ultra futuristic virtual reality system that always distracted me in other movies with similar basic concepts. Don't touch my sock! Liked the movie a lot. But can we recognize that the first 15 minutes is almost exactly The Lego Movie? Like nearly shot for shot. Fun movie with more heart than I was expecting. Alex Trebek and Chris Evans cameo will get lot of attention but man Channing Tatum killed it as well. My boy, Steve ""The Hair"" Harrington, finally got the girl. Did not expect to hear about how one of the main character's shitty employment situation was partly due to college loans. It may be 'BOOOORING', but it threw me back into the (real real) world for a moment there. Imma be honset, i was a little bit disappointed Millie didn't sing the Mariah Carey song to make Guy remember but they made up for it by using it in the climax. 

Anywho, I thought it was a great movie. Its like the Truman Show of video games, is the best comparison i can think of. The cameos and references were great. 

Of the movies I've seen since theaters have been back: this, Jungle Cruise and suicide squad have been a delight The Channing Tatum scene cutting between him and the person behind his character was so goofy.

EDIT: Also was that Alex Trebek? RIP. TFW I noticed the icon for ""subtle product placement"" but couldn't figure out what the product was Good movie but as an IT guy and a gamer some of the stuff at the end regarding computers was bugging me. I know, just let it go, but I just kept thinking how that is not how it worked.

* >!If reseting the servers would make him lose his AI programming then the players would probably lose all their stuff, thus destroying the game.!<
* >!They don't need to go to the island in the game to prove they used their source code, just look through the code. Also, when the villain bought their game company I am sure this would have covered his ability to use their code.!<
* >!Later, when the CEO (sorry no idea about the name) is trying to stop them why did he try to destroy the servers? He literally just rebooted all servers a few minutes ago. Just do the same thing but shut them down.!<
* >!When the CEO starts destroying servers the first whiff of smoke in a modern looking datacenter like that would have set off the fire suppression system killing him if he didn't immediately evacuate. Even if that didn't kill him he probably would have electrocuted himself. That many servers is no joke on the voltage. Also, very doubtful they would have an on-prem data center.!<
* >!Very doubtful a game company would launch a sequel and then just just down the original server. they would run both in parallel until the original lost enough subscribers. I think they still run EverQuest servers.!<
* >!Prior to the server room destruction, the protagonists just could have got the AI data from backups. Any company worth its salt would also have a secondary copy of backups offsite. So there was little danger of losing the AI. At any point, the Stranger Things dude could have just copied the backup files and ended the movie much sooner.!<
* >!Last, which is covered in the movie but bears repeating, fan bases of games have abandoned them and caused them to fail for far less. Yea they said it was a flop because of bugs but all the other crap, especially lack of backwards compatabilioty after promsiing it would have caused it to flop most likely.!< I expected Jeff Bridges when they began to upload Dude to Free City. Downtown and Make Your Own Kind of Music within the first half hour? Was someone a LOST fan or just a coincidence? Our theater absolutely lost it when Guy used Captain America's Shield and the Lightsaber. Feels amazing being back in a theater with that kind of energy Fun movie, one thing. 
The scene where Keys and Millie are looking at each other at the end lasted so long and cut back and forth so many times it could have been a sketch from “I think you should leave” Man I needed a feel good movie like that. I laughed, I cried but most importantly man I had fun. ""Don't you see it? I'm a love letter to you""

That part actually made me emotional and I was NOT expecting it. It was incredibly well made, everything connected. The characters actually feel genuine. The Chris Evans cameo had my theater howling.

Question though: I remember that this movie was in the can before Disney bought Fox, did they add that stuff in reshoots? I know folks mostly like the other music, but it was the musical theme from Christophe Beck that caught me.   It was immediately familiar like something I'd known for a long time. But even though I recognized it, but couldn't place it right away.  It is labeled 'ice cream' on the score.  It also plays as his memory comes back I think.

I Just spent hours trying to figure it out.  I didn't know anything about Beck before this, but I know composers like to reuse some of their best and sometimes underappreciated work.  After reading through his previous work, I finally got it.  It was from the Disney short 'Paperman', one of my favorite shorts.  I've seen it a ton of times.  The familiar part is towards the end.

https://youtu.be/Z4dIgUgYCxQ?t=390 Didn’t think Free Guy would be last time I’d see Alex Trebek on my screen but here we are.. I know this will be a weird comparison for many but am I the only person who got some Truman Show vibes from parts of this movie? 20 minutes in I was thinking ""This is fine. Its basically just the trailer"" but the further into the movie I got, the more I started to enjoy it.

It has a surprisingly emotional plot and a really feel good attitude plus a lot of the jokes are genuinely funny. I like Ryan Reynolds at this level where he's doing the shtick he's known for but not going too over the top with it and I surprisingly felt invested in the real world stuff

Up there with Barb and Star as my biggest surprise of this year I was so much waiting for a They Live wrestling match about putting the glasses on. Too bad that didn't happen. Watched it with my gf, afterwards she comented, “Steve Harrington can say that his love letter was so powerful that it came to life as goofy Ryan Reynolds, what girl wouldn’t ride his dick?”

In all seriousness a very heartfelt movie that actually is thoughtful about the themes presented. If you can get past whatever the fuck Taika Waititi was trying to do as Anton and you’ve got a fun well made blockbuster that has fun with the video game concepts it presents. Man that Alex Trebek cameo hit hard, RIP I liked it, but man Taika Waititi was truly not good in this. I guess they were going for “horribly out of touch middle aged man” because the “whatchu talking bout, willis” line was pure cringe The Captain America and Star Wars moments were so hilarious The fact that the movie had Dwayne Johnson, Tina Fey, Hugh Jackman, and John Krasinski all in just voice cameos. I did think the guy who gave Millie the info sounded like Jackman and even with his history with Reynolds and working with Shawn Levy before, I still was doubting myself. https://www.ign.com/articles/chris-evans-free-guy-cameos Fun movie! Better than I thought it would be!

- Ryan Reynolds playing himself again but with a little bit of heart
- Film was deeper than I thought. Never expected it to be indie game developers fighting a gaming studio for stealing their code.
- Jodie Comer is great in the movie! She's about to blow up like crazy with The Last Duel
- CGI in the film was a little unrefined but I can chalk it up to the graphics in the Free City game
- I felt like some scenes were changed in post-production and reshoots. Some scenes that appeared in the trailer also don't make the final cut.
- Some of the cameos were great! Seeing Channing Tatum after quite some time is great!
- The movie took full advantage of the Disney-Fox merger with the Avengers and Star Wars references!
- Never thought Joe Keery's character would get the girl. I kept waiting for one of them get hit by a vehicle when they reunited in the middle of the road. 
- Guy getting his friend back was a nice way to end the film! Their friendship was wholesome throughout the movie! 

Really had fun watching the movie! Movie glitched out for 20mins in my cinema during the 2nd act but I wouldn't mind watching it again! This was delightful. It isn't the highest of art, but it was still a damn enjoyable experience. Fun movie, Jodie Comer was the star and her leather pants MVP Glad I went back to the theaters to see this just for the Chris Evans reaction. Life is good DUDE was fucking hilarious. Every time he was on screen just in the midst of a crowd I was cracking up. I feel like the IRL story could’ve been tighter but all in all this was a lot of fun. Ryan Reynolds flexes his natural charm and the movie didn’t make the Ready Player One mistake of just throwing a bunch of stuff in from other properties. That way, when what happens in the third act happens, it’s a genuine surprise. The movie was very entertaining, but I don't really get the motivation of Taika Waititi's character (Antwan), he just seemed like he was written in just to give the film a more active villain (instead of the threat of the game shutting down naturally). Also, Keys' friend was opposing him and bootlicking Antwan yet at the end they were still buddies? The Channing Tatum revival has begun! I truly hated Antwon while watching this film. The directors and actor did very well to make him as greedy, unlikable, and petty as possible. 

Worst part is, I feel like I could've turned out as money-hungry and petty as him if it weren't for people in my life bringing me down to reality. Free Guy is the type of movie you know you’re not meant to take too seriously and just go along with the ride. That being said, how much you’ll like it depends on your tolerance for Ryan Reynolds. If you never found him funny, don’t bother as he’s loud, brash, slightly obnoxious, and very chatty in this. He has some good moments though, but a lot of jokes are very hit and miss, but yeah this is a silly movie and you shouldn’t think too hard about logic stuff.

The concept is pretty good, although not the most original thing in the world. The idea of a protagonist figuring out his whole life is a video game is cool and the film takes some advantage of being creative and wacky with the world and concepts surrounding it. There’s product placement, references to movies, game stuff, and Twitch streamers in it, so yeah it’s very corporate, but it didn’t bother me much.

Overall, I didn’t dislike this and treated it for what it is. A fun silly blockbuster that doesn’t try to be high art and just there to entertain. The film starts out decent but loses steam around the halfway mark. I wasn’t the biggest fan of Taika Waititi in this, unfortunately. I was able to tolerate Ryan Reynolds, but any time he was the focus it became a bit grating. It doesn’t all work and I’m sure there are plotholes and logic issues, but you know what I got some enjoyment and laughs out of it. 6/10 I can’t be the only one who didn’t like this movie Taika saying he had ass & ball cancer then gestures to them both going “INOPERABLE!!!” is the hardest I’ve laughed at a movie in awhile. Don't think I enjoyed it nearly as much as the majority of this subreddit. Didn't think it was bad but also didn't live up to it's potential.

The idea of GTA NPC becoming self-aware is great, but can't help but feel like this movie could have done more with the set-up. I feel like a major part of this is because the *Free City* video game remains poorly defined and never actually feels like a game. Whereas the worlds of comparable films like *The Truman Show* and *The Lego Movie* feel defined, *Free Guy*'s video game setting feels less concrete and more like a mish-mash of references and tropes that are more window-dressing than anything else.

The naive protagonist trying to save a fictional world from destruction continually invites comparisons to *The Lego Movie* but *Free Guy* lacks that movie's wit and heart. It's a light and breezy watch but I doubt I'll ever feel the need to revisit or think about it again. Honestly it’s a really cute movie, with a lot of heart.
It’s a fun popcorn flick, that I wish more people could go to the movies and see. I laughed a good amount of times and had fun with it.


One of my minor grips is that there’s a glaring amount of ADR in this. It’s probably from the various (COVID) delays, it kept taking me out of the movie. The Chris Evans “WHAT THE SHIT?!?!” was so funny. I wish Mouser had tried to stop Antoine in the server room. He could have redeemed himself by buying Buddy and Guy their moment rather than the destruction just pausing conveniently. Plus the added irony of the security guards cheering for Buddy as their colleague enables his destruction by removing Mouser from the server room. Ten times the film the marketing leads you to believe. So much more heart than I was expecting. I saw this yesterday with a fairly packed theatre. There were several kids in the same row as me, all younger than 10 or 11. Towards the beginning when we first see Reynolds, one of them whispers ""who is that guy again?"" One of the others responded ""I can't remember his name right now.""

But when those YouTubers showed up on screen, these kids lost their fucking minds. They knew all of them, and were practically screaming in glee over it. 

I think they missed most of the references and cameos, but they sure as hell didn't miss that. Man, after watching a screening back in Feb 2020 I can finally talk about the movie. Second Life, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto, and the Sims rolled into one with references to Halo, Star Wars, and Marvel and some big names from both the acting world and the streaming world as background characters. Went in with low expectations and came out with a big smile on my face! The theater I was in was about 75% full , biggest audience at a movie since before covid I was really impressed with this movie. Like many others, I wasn’t expecting much when the promo started and I hadn’t planned to see it until I recently saw it getting good reviews. A few jokes and lines of dialogue didn’t quite land, but when they did they REALLY landed. There are a few moments near the end that are some of the most satisfying, funny movie moments I can think of in quite some time. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this and I’d definitely encourage people to check it out. Lots of charm, and for a video game movie it felt very self aware and it was obvious the creators did their research. It's a bit of a mindfuck having this movie come out now. I don't even remember really why at this point, but I took a picture of the poster one of the last times I went to a theater --- almost two years ago. This movie was way better than I expected. I feel the trailers undersold it. I’m not saying it was Oscar worthy or even the best popcorn flick, but it was definitely fun. Maybe it was my low expectations, but the theater reactions were genuine. So disappointed and I enjoy most of Reynolds' work. Tech Jargon was awful and forced, the cameos from streamers were entirely unneeded, the acting from some was just phoned in or bad enough I'm sure they are people they found on the corner. A lot of it was just ""look at popular game reference here"" behind that is a very, very weak love story. Something I doubt I see again. I love they just nonchalantly threw in their one f-word. Not in a fight scene or even when Taika was berating his employees.
Also Taika going from a fan favorite in one movie last week to a heel in a movie the following week. Is there anything that man can’t do? Kissing is not a option in the game…

20 mins later her main character somehow kisses guy 🤦🏻‍♂️ Went into it expecting another Ryan Reynolds flick, but this shit was fun and packed with great humor from top to bottom. It's extra great if you're into video games. They nailed a lot of things in this one, kudos to everyone involved. Deadpool is the Walmart brand America's Ass. And they didn't hit you over the head with jt. This movie will age well with re-watcbes. I am here after two viewings, seeing what reddit said, so for historic context (and I'm going to write a post about it), this was a PROFOUNDLY existential and philosophical movie about the angst of the human condition, meaning/purpose, what it means to exist and ""be"", what it means to be present, what it means to live with intentionality, the nature of what love ""is"", and how it can manifest, and especially about male friendship and lack of male toxicity. Also, that the nature of the human experience is not meant to be about subjugation, or being a background player yoked to the mundanity of your own existence, but to realize life isn't about work, but leisure... and ""doing whatever you want"" ie not being anchored to the notion you will never ""level up"" and are at a society level ""stasis"" where you watch a ruling class level up, ignore laws, and mod reality with impunity.

I don't think there's been a film with more intellectual subtext since Annihilation. I am floored. He reminded me of Will Ferrell in Elf towards the beginning. He did find love! Maybe not romantic love, but certainly a Buddy love Shhhh. That’s for the sequel I'm glad that Guy was happy being there with his best friend. I was expecting them to give him another Millie but I was pleasantly surprised they didn't go that way Tatum is such an underrated actor. Wish he was in more comedies. My theater laughed the loudest when the mom said “ you’re 22 and you’re still living here, there is no god!” I may have misquoted . The back arch after he drops down in TiTE is too much *Mom! Mom!! No! Don't touch my special sock or you're going to need therapy for life!* Same. I was thinking that guy looks a lot like Channing Tatum but then I thought why would he be here for such a small part Tatum as a bottom sub was hilarious! ""Hey guys what's up?"" I loved those random filler text lines. I'm a programmer and I've totally done that before. I love how he did the hand reload thing Henry Cavill did in Mission Impossible while fighting. As one of the Art Nerds, seeing the amount of improv coming out of Taika was absolutely insane. Can't wait to see it and piece together what was ad-libbed vs. scripted. It was even better seeing the CGI unfinished at the end scene when that actor is holding Ryan Reynolds. i laughed so hard when i heard friendly gesture and i don’t know why Just got out of the film. My favourite line in the movie:

""I love 3 things.

Kicking ass.

TBD.

Third item here."" Thanks to Dude, I now say ""Catchphrase!"" way more than I should Only thing I wish was that he was constantly switching between t-pose and scripted animations The blue shirt tattoo was great Wow. Thanks for posting this.

Didn't recognize it watching the movie, but yeah, clearly a throwback to that scene. They also referenced Halo. The UNSC Scorpion tank is seen a couple times roaming the streets towards the beginning of the film I believe. Also the sun glass fight in They Live was alluded to. When he first went to the beach, it seemed like an homage to The Truman Show. I was absolutely expecting one of them to get hit by a car How did they get the rights to marvel and star wars? Was the movie produced by Disney or did they just shell out a fuckton of money? FRIENDLY GESTURE  👉✋ You seem ADJECTIVE [Catchphrase!](https://youtu.be/upnZFmQEcW0) That's from the CollegeHumor skit on Every Oscar Movie Ever. I haven seen it in years.

https://youtu.be/w2b0QT3lXOw My friends and I sat a few seats away from a kid. And everytime a streamer popped up he would get all excited and say their name to himself and his parents. Im not really into streaming but I thought it was cool for the kid to get all giddy like that. Fun movie. I agree, there were so many Easter eggs in the background. My personal favorite was the “[subtle product placement](https://mobile.twitter.com/AviationGin/status/1426175403874455558).” Yeah I’m pretty sure it was. Also think the first playable character that Guy takes down was voiced by the Rock I thought that too! Was sort of thinking he'd end up being a larger part of the film until >!Mills offs him!<. I should've watched the credits a bit longer than I did... Definitely was. On noticing his voice I thought he was going to be a recurring character who gets revealed at the end FYI - Jackman is the reason Reynolds did the movie.  He is friends with the director and introduced them. I honestly hardly watch serious movies anymore. 
I work as a CNA in a hospital while raising 3 kids during a pandemic. When I watch a movie, I want to feel good, to escape. I don’t want to end up even more depressed after it’s finished! 
One of my favorite movie this year is the Mitchell’s against the machine. And I am not even shy to admit it. Ted Lasso is great.  Wholesome yet filled with f-bombs all the time. Yeah at first I thought they must have had to pay a FORTUNE for those Marvel and Star Wars references and then I remembered... ""What the shit..."" Avengers/Star Wars music got me good Did not see the lightsaber coming. Picturing the production staff being told that Disney and Fox just merged and the only thing Ryan Reynolds said was ""wait, does that mean we can get Chris Evans?"" Apparently he was in town for something else and Ryan called him up for a cameo.  He said he'd do it if he could be in and out in 10 minutes.  Apparently it only took 7. *And* he's got that *Reservoir Dogs* show on FX. The man is in his **prime** this year. Yeah, one of those things where the movie was locked more than a year ago and that bit just reads completely differently. Have a Nice one guy! Yeah, it was smart to show them also slowly becoming self aware after another NPC brought it to their attention. Learned to make a cappuccino and wrote a memoir…more than I’ve done during quarantine! I'd also make an argument that there was a potential romance that they edited out. When the bombshell character makes the comment about not needing men at all, and the celebration of the NPCs on the top of the tower, it looks like they cut away from the barista character kissing bombshell on the cheek... IDK, I think it's a bit sudden after everyone in the shop practically threatened to kill Guy for ordering a different kind of coffee. The cop even said ""someone's about to get shot"". The guy with his hands up finally put them down in the next game too! I liked that they started to evolve after interactions with Guy. Made it look like evolution was contagious. It made me want to see more well done bromance movies :( Buddy is the heart of the film for me. He is essentially the Guy of the Free Guy film. He's the background character who has his own emotional growth in the film instead of the game. He has the emotional intelligence to give a really thoughtful answer when Guy basically asks him what's the meaning of life and best of all, he's just a good friend. I just like that they incorporated real world people in a way that isn't horribly cringy like most movies do. Ok wait who are those names tho now i feel hella old My 70 year old dad was more excited about Ninja than I was. Apparently, he knows him from Raid: Shadow Legends. When the streamers started appearing, I said to myself, ""Ah, I bet PewDiePie shows up."" Then I realized I wouldn't recognize him if he did because I've only ever heard of him, but I don't know what he actually looks like. Then I felt old and irrelevant lol. That was a really nice reveal! It's a real bug that happens in games, so it felt authentic. You can tell the writers actually play and love video games. But it also explained a little habit Guy had earlier in the movie. Nice payoff. I don't think that was supposed to be real time reflections' but more the standard cube map reflection box that most games use. The director I think made this movie based on the mafia boss meme Lol I got that vibe too. I'm completely guessing but I feel like it could've been a reference to the in-engine ads vs in-game graphics disparity some games have Nah mate. Look at the orbs. Totally a Crackdown movie. ;) Too PG-13 for Saints Row. Not enough dildo-themed weapons I honestly might have to agree. I had a blast with this, had me hooked from start to finish! James Gunn's The Suicide Squad is the best flick of the summer IMO, but this definitely deserves the 2nd spot (and I loved the hell out of it). It is! At least for me it is. I watched the Suicide Squad a couple of weeks ago and and I didn't expect this one to be better. Life has been a bit heavy for me recently but after watching the film, I felt great for the first time in a while. I didn't have a nice day, I had a great day:) Taika seemed to improvise his lines a lot but man, they did not fit with his douchey character. The ass and balls cancer. Inoperable! Got the biggest laugh from me i loved taika but this comment reminded me of jean ralphio and ben schwartz would have been perfect Hope I'm not too harsh in saying this but... if Taika's not writing the role for himself, then don't cast him at all. It just didn't seem his vibe and everything felt forced. This might be the first time I didn’t like Taika in a role. Aziz would have been ideal Or maybe Jason Mantzoukas Its ok you can say Ready Player One Man, that dude has been typecast. Eh, I thought that was a little too gross and should have been a funny throwaway line, not repeated ten times in five seconds. My theater laughed pretty hard at that Bruh I just watched the movie on Disney + and my mum asked me to explain the joke to her Not even just the intro, the whole movie. Millie being the 'Wyldstyle' character that shows 'Emmet' (Guy) he's special and not just a normal NPC, etc. Down to the coffee! If only we had gotten a musical number, that would've been hilarious. Feels like the first time I’ve seen Tatum in a while Channing Tatum changing facial expression from excited, to shouting at the mom, to dancing was golden. This movie convinced me that Joe Keery can make that rom-com male lead money like Noah Centineo Steve “The Hair” Harrington, lol. Or as I call him: Steve Hairrington. I like to think because they cut out the film right as they were about to kiss in the middle of a street that a speeding bus tragically killed one of them just before their love could be actualized. A tragic ending, but clearly what the director was going for. I was really glad they didn't leave him sidelined and had Millie go for him instead of Guy which would have been weird. They both had the nicest apartments. I was like … I don’t buy that explanation one bit. I still don't know how she kissed him... They had already discussed that there wasn't a button for that. I'm surprised Guy didn't notice it was Millie straight away. When he first started becoming sentient, all it took was a glance but when he got rebooted, he wasn't able to become sentient even after talking to her. I’d say it’s like a more wholesome westworld. The plots are almost exactly the same. Probably my favorite scene just because goofy Channing is the best Channing. And while I don't care for fortnite dances they really got their money's worth getting Magic Mike himself to do them. I loved that he had a Deadpool poster. ""You're 22 and living in my house. There is no god"". If we’re thinking about the same one (near the beginning, soon after he first puts on the glasses), it was a bottle of Aviation Gin - Ryan Reynolds’ gin brand I thought being called Neutrogena in the script was a (welcomed) product placement in itself while discussing Guy’s skin I'm not even a tech person and all that lingo made me cringe Pretty much nothing made sense really. Almost every tech aspect of this movie was ""off"" at the very least. Nothing about the servers for instance makes any sense. So it seems like the whole game is just one single lobby containing every single player where different parts of the map run on different servers. Which is absolutely insane honestly and would require a map that's much bigger than the one in the movie appears to be. Also if Antwan didn't want the original map to be discovered, couldn't he just have deleted it instead of fucking hiding it in the Free City map? Any player could have found that shit easily with a glitch or a noclip cheat, that shit was retardedly risky. I'd also like to point out that every single NPC seems be a unique individual with their own unique model, audio, behavior and even unique programming. That's an insane amount of work for a GTA like game that's absolutely swarming with insignificant civillian NPC's. I might believe it if it was supposed to be a game from the future, but it isn't. This game is very strange and also way too technologically advanced to be believable as a game from today. party pooper That would have been epic Coming in as a Tron/Dude combo! I love that even after all this time, those songs are still kinda known as the LOST songs. I’m so glad someone else noticed this Downtown will always make me think of LOST! I had a seat kicker behind me and a group of people who kept checking Facebook on their phones in the row in front of me.

I loved the movie, but after nearly 19 months of not going to the theater, this made me remember why I'm so on board for Premier access and other streaming services. Literally felt the same goosebumps I felt when I first watched Endgame in a completely full cinema. It wasn't even half full this time but compared with how things have been over the past year, it was a lot and it reminded why I will always prefer watching films like this at the cinema than at home I was waiting for one of them to cross the street, and get hit by a car as the screen cuts to black. I seriously thought ""are they just going to stand there making eyes at each other and that's all? What if this was a reshoot post-COVID and they couldn't physically touch each other?"" - but no, it was just a reeeeeeaaallly long moment. I thought it was setting up a comedic moment but then it just... Didn't .. was weird but whatever I thought it was about showing their facial expressions.

Keys face at first was like ""why are you here?""

Millie's face then was like ""I know what you did. ""

Keys face ""what is this.... oh...""

Millie face ""yes I know now""

""i love you""

""I love you too""

""so... are we gonna cross the street or something?"" Yeah, the movie already felt a little long and then they kept dragging out the end with those unnecessary scenes.

That plus all of the crowd shots from people watching in Times Square and all over the world. I swear, they cut to those shots *so many* times at the climax of the movie and it's like.... we get it I enjoyed it too, a lot of mindless fun and not a dark note to be had anywhere. I did a double feature today. Green Knight and Free Guy. After that slow burn and intense drama, it was nice to have a fun movie that was surprisingly even better than I thought it would be. Chris Evans cameo and the Avengers theme was fantastic. So was Channing Tatum This movie felt like a rom-com at times, and not in a bad way. I love the love story in the film. I thinkhink it was brilliant as it made the film more accessible and less 'only for the video game fans'. Same reaction as you, great cameo. Have to imagine they were from reshoots Watched an interview with Director Shawn Levy... They were getting ready to shoot the third act when Fox was purchased.  Him and Reynolds emailed Disney asking about a couple of cool things and Disney said yes and told them to go as crazy as they want... perfect timing.  Link here: https://youtu.be/AyujsakB18c Taika doing Thor and Ryan doing Deadpool it just makes sense they even did a Korg promo for this movie I was wondering that, too. 

Overall I felt this movie handle the references/cameos way better than RPO, or Space Jam 2. Apparently, filming started a month after the merger occurred, so the filmmakers reached out to Disney asking for a number of references to their properties, and were given the green light to all of them.

https://www.etonline.com/free-guy-director-shawn-levy-talks-secret-cameos-and-mariah-carey-exclusive-170266 > Paperman

I have come back from just seeing the film, and this instantly hit me as the music from paperman. Not sure how many people will recognise it, but it's one of Disney's best shorts for sure. Not weird- that is the comparison. Character finds out his whole world is a lie (and product placement) .. like they even had the same beach Yes. You are the only person that noticed the similarities. Yeah, at some point the movie really hit its stride, probably around that 1/4 mark.  The plot had a lot more depth than what the trailers suggested. It's still undeniably Ryan Reynolds but his character in this movie had no snark. Pure sentimentality. I'd say that's the opposite of his shtick. Just slathered with his same charm. First there was the scene where Guy tries to get his black friend to put on the glasses so he can see reality

And then there was the ""I'm here to kick ass and..."" line near the end of the movie

I got pretty strong They Live vibes from this Too bad they splattered it all over the trailers. Could have been an amazing surprise. 

And before someone tells me not to watch trailers I usually don't but this trailer has been playing in front of movies for over a year now. That’s what I liked about it. Like he clearly doesn’t get video games and probably was just a trust fund kid who got lucky stealing code I think they were going for the ""guy who thinks he can be 'cool' if he bases his whole personality on references and stealing other people's credit"" - reminded me of an episode of New Girl where the main character gets people ten years younger than her to think she's cool by quoting catchphrases of 80s TV characters like she just came up with them. You're not supposed to like him. I thought he was hilarious in the shit-head villain role. Him trying to ""kip-up"" after squatting on the ground killed me. He really reminded me of the guy from Grandma's Boy. Really out of touch and not funny, but funny to himself. I think it worked! yeah i think they were going for a cringey character lol Middle aged poseur was the character, and Waititi nailed it to the wall. Funniest part of the movie was Chris Evans going “what the shit” lol. Such a fun adventure, it wasn’t the best movie ever but man I left with a big smile on my face. How far along was Free Guy before Disney acquired Fox? Curious if these were in the original script/cut or if it was a reshoot. I love corporate synergy Watched in South Korea. Compared to the US the movieoging experience is very reserved - not a lot of clapping or reactions from crowds which is nice.

Anyways, the moment where Chris Evans came on was the first time (aside from MCU movies which are wildly popular here) that I've seen a theater here erupt with cheering and clapping. Very pleasantly surprised with the movie. Wish we got to see Buddy and Guy have their beer on the beach though. 

Also loved the npc who gets robbed had his arms up the entire time he was running from the server collapsing the world and cheering on the roof with the others. Seeing him cheer by moving his arms forward instead of up was so funny. >CGI in the film was a little unrefined but I can chalk it up to the graphics in the Free City game

They were definitely trying to make it appear very game-like. There was other CGI mixed in that was much better Her hiding in her turtle neck was so adorable. Just watched the film and now I have a crush on her. She's so adorable indeed She’s incredible Hated to see her go but loved to watch her leave. Loved her since Doctor Foster. So so hot. Her in the Molotov Girl outfit was hot af I'm definitely going back to see it (hopefully in a packed cinema) just for the Shield/Chris Evans reaction. I literally got goosebumps and felt like I was back watching Endgame with the audience reaction The NPC who almost always kept his arms up was one of the most hilarious background character for me. While running from when the city was being destroyed, to cheering on the roof as Guy made it across and since he wasn't pumping his fist or clapping he did a weird cheer move with his body, and everywhere else he was in.

I also liked how it seem like it was implied it was DUDE that rescued the kittens for the NPC woman who keeps losing them with him standing next to her in the shot  they were all in a line. Catchphrase I dunno. After all the recent stuff about Blizzard, Taika's character seems to be on point for a CEO. He even had a obvious sexual harassment lawsuit line. My main takeaway was [DO NOT DEVELOP MY APP](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rickandmorty/images/3/30/Glootie.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190720005839). Keys coworker was 100% cool with rebooting Guy even though he was fully aware he was a sentient being, and then acted like he was good the whole like 5 minutes later it was mediocre at best, and i am baffled by the amount of praise it is getting. He's very hit or miss in this, but when he hits, he hits *hard*. The back-and-forth with Mouser on what their catchphrase should be - ""GET BACK TO WORK!"" - had me rolling. I could have sworn he said ""inoperable"" whats adr >I can finally talk about the movie.

*proceeds to say nothing.* I genuinely would not mind seeing a sequel. It’s a really fun idea I think they could take even further. Maybe have hackers take over this new game of theirs and completely turn the game upside down. Was he really the fan favorite? He had a 5 second cameo where he just says rats are good people I kinda wish they had saved it for the Chris Evans scene. The scene was hilarious the way they did it or even a spit take would've been funny. But I think a ""What the fuck?"" there would've been even funnier cause they used quite a few ""shits"" throughout the film already. I loved the Chris Evans cameo lol Hey, Deadpool's Canada's Ass not America's.  If anything, the Walmart brand is likely the Punisher skull First background thing that really made me lose it was when he was taking his new amounts of money out of the ATM and you see a player just crouch jumping and running into the wall in the background. There was a lot of little things happening in the background that made it fun to watch and pay attention to. Like how the buff Ryan Reynolds had ""whey protein"" as an item in his UI, or random players just jumping into walls over and over That was actually one of my favorite things about this movie. It's possible to end with the male lead not getting the girl. But Buddy! Love that guy. I agree! They even set up the final reunion in the middle of the street the same way for both ‘couples’ It's guy love, between two guys. Free Guy 2: The Frequel For sure. It was a really nice subversion, but it’s also funny when you think of how Keys was like “Yeah I programmed him to desperately want yet never find love except for with this one girl whom I am currently dating sorry” The saddest interview I ever saw was Tatum at an Oscars round table and he was articulating the worst case of impostor syndrome that he didn’t belong with everyone else. I just wanted to jump through the computer screen and hype him up Fun fact, the mom was voiced by Tina Fey Did she really say 22? Most 22 year olds now-a-days living at home unless they're away for school I guess. “I love him?” There are 3 things I love: kicking ass, TBD, and third item You seem adjective! THAT's where I recognized that move from! Jeez it was bothering me so much that I couldn't place it. Especially because he wasn't wearing a shirt, and Cavill's character was doing it to adjust his shirt. I feel like this somehow flew under everyone's radar. Were you literally one of the actors in the movie? Meet Joe Black. A classic 90s film if I do say so myself.

I can't look at peanut butter the same way anymore after watching it. There was also a Mantis from Halo 4 near the beginning That has to be the longest most stupid fight scene that has ever been made, only to end ""Hmm maybe you are right"" XD. I’m so glad they didn’t undercut either of those moments *Free Guy* was produced by Fox and came out a significant amount of time after the Disney/Fox merger. I’d imagine those two huge Avengers and Star Wars references at the end were added on late in the game after the merger had taken place. Corporate synergy, baby LOUDER LAUGHING I did this as a 35 man to my wife. My wife: 😑 Community's subway product placement ranks up there I noticed the text but I didn't see that it was Aviation. That's hysterical! It was. I watched the credits and Dewayne Johnson was the voice. [Yep looks like he confirmed it haha](https://twitter.com/ign/status/1425536771807334404?s=21) I knew Taika was in this movie and at first I thought it was him doing a gruff voice but then soon thought ""Is that Hugh?"" and realized it's a Ryan Reynolds movie so it made sense. You should watch palm springs on hulu. It's a great time. The marketing is horrible, but the movie is a delight. Second season is a bit heavy comparatively. I was shocked they were willing to pay but then I remembered That’s how it feels!

(To have someone else lift your iconic weapon) That line was definitely one of the top 100 funniest parts of the movie. I feel the F-Bomb would have been better used there. The avengers theme alone sold it. Idk why we don't get more cameos like that. If I was an actor whenever I heard someone was working on something cool I'd be like yo can I get a throwaway line or background character scene. Something quick and easy just so I could be a part of a project I thought was cool. Reservation Dogs, not reservoir. Also that show is rock solid and hilarious. And he just wrapped Thor 4 and is in the very early stages of his Star Wars movie! Kind of a sidebar from Free Guy here:

I’m a massive Jeopardy! Fan and I although it made me sad, I know Alex for sure would love the fact that he is popping up in a wholesome video game based movie that’s infinitely far from his own interests and roots. He’d get a kick out of it 100%. Read his memoir “The Answer Is” very short and easy read, it helped me a lot dealing with his passing and you find out how genuinely classy and funny that man was. Legend. Millie and Keys essentially invented Skynet.

Except their AI hasn't tried to exterminate humanity and take over the world... yet... Well, there was the giant tank that turned and aimed at him I Love You, Man with Rudd and Segal is a great one It was pretty cringy, especially pokimane’s The whole movie I kept thinking, “I bet these are real streamers… and I don’t know a single one of them.”

Honestly it’s the kind of getting old I like. LMFAO He knows him from Raid Shadow Legends, that’s hiliarious >  You can tell the writers actually play and love video games. 

They kinda do, but in next moment wierd thigns happen, like mods with ""godmode"" building stairs instead of just fly in while t-posing and ignoring collision, and other stuff that does not make sense. Beautifully said. This is 100% correct.

This occurs so often it's insane, Less so these days, however in many many games there were whole levels cut from games but with cubemaps still present - in some cases cubemaps remained even in sequel games.

Really great bit of attention to detail there. *thats how mafia works* It felt like he was on set for a week and they didn’t really have a script for him and just said be an over the top douche, and he took it to 11 Huh, I honestly thought it was the translation and there simply not being words for a lot of English slang that did him dirty... I saw a dubbed version in my local cinema, and his character just came off so incredibly forced and the voice actor sounded so off and uncomfortable, I never even stopped to consider if those lines would have worked in English.

Now I just can't unsee Aziz Ansari in the character. I loved every one of his lines, he really did it for me here. I find that a lot of movie villains get portrayed as cool to some degree but Taika was just full on asshole. His ""get back to work"" line when Mouser was seeking his approval hit me the hardest in my funny bone. It was funny because the theater was rolling the whole movie but that line got absolute silence for some reason. I'm still laughing at ""Albuquerque boiled turkey!"" What are you talking about Ben Schwartz played Key. How did you miss that? I don't disagree. It didn't really land for me. But when he did the whole KFC comparison thing, I immediately imagined a Tom Haverford type. When he dropped “whatchu talkin bout, Willis” I cringed SO hard lol I love Taika but he almost took me out of it at some points. Just so unnecessarily over the top, which at least that was consistently his character but *yeesh* It felt fairly natural to me tbh. Reminded me of his performance in Jojo Rabbit (which is definitely risky to compare to). Come to collect the knives you left in me back bro? He was the favorite character for my wife and I. I guess he's polarizing lol. Oh there was no laughing in mine-

 you could tell it was for most- a moment of I realize what he means and I don't want to acknowledge that I know what it means so I'm just going to be very silent with a very loud and silent void in the theater and hope that everything just moves on She’s gonna need counselling for the rest of her life We did get that Mariah Carey song repeated severally times though. Almost as catchy as Everything is Awesome. Just looked it up. He's got a 7ish year old kid and is taking time to be a dad. Last film I saw him in was Logan Lucky back in 2017. Minor voice cameo for The Lego Movie 2, but not the same. 

Shame we never got his Gambit and Kingsman 3 movie. I was surprise with Keery’s role. From the trailers I thought he was gonna be a small side character. And yes, he can lead a rom-com if he’s given the opportunity.

Edit: grammar He's one of the best parts of Stranger Things for a reason, the guy's good. Dude totally could, good looking with some solid acting chops and a ton of charisma. Really enjoy watching him on the screen so I’m hoping he has a nice career outside of stranger things. Good to see him not get beat within an inch of his life for once I was really hoping no vehicle would hit them after seeing so many people get hit by vehicles earlier and then they did another meet in the middle of a street again and I waited for it thinking it would come and it didn't thankfully. Then I waited to see if there was aftercredits and nothing. I was soooo anxious at the end. I kinda knew that killing off these characters would be an idiotic idea that totally wouldn’t fit with the rest of the film, but the fear was still there. I think he sold out their game to pay his college loans back and started working for the company as kind of a subtle way to work from the “inside” to make the company a better place. Hell, he could have been hoping that someday he’d have the chance to revive the game that they had built. Gotta just let that one go. Definitely a plot hole [deleted] Literally the biggest oups of the movie for me. That is If you ignore all the technical programming  non sense that happens as well. At the end of the day it was not really important as it's a comedy before anything else. I gave a pass to all the unrealistic or plot hole i could find. Totally. Still, the pan out to her face in the real world was so amazing that I give it a pass. The way i interputed it was that, hearing her singing the song is what caught his attention and what triggered his sentience. I was hoping she'll remember this first encounter and start singing the song to trigger it again.

EDIT: Here's a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RwXqjTDOHs) of their first encounter actually. They had met before. She knew his catchphrase which means he said it to her several times before. It was her singing Mariah Carey. At that point though he'd had 4 years of searching for someone This movie definitely felt like a ""Hey lets get some friends together and goof around on set for a bit"" kind of movie. Actually the hiding part is what bugs me least. This is something that regularly happens in SW development, especially when under time pressure. A valid reason might be that the game crashed when the Island was deleted and no one had time to figure out why. So they just hid it and carried on. Did anyone else binge watch Lost? I watched 27 episodes over a weekend Downtown is the short circuit 2 song for me. Ushers need to do their jobs again. 

 I feel like they used to be more serious with these types of people. Was half expecting someone to get hit by a car and then it cut to a guy playing the driver revealing they are in a game themselves. It's intentionally long to make you keep waiting for them to get hit by the car. So many moments it could've happened and didn't. I’m just curious how they got the game instantly streaming to the CRT TVs in the small Asian restaurants. What about the violence in the server room? Distressing  to see so much hardware go to waste :D > not a dark note to be had anywhere

What about that moment where Guy was hyping up the real world to the NPCs and got to gun violence?

""Oh yeah, it's a real problem.""

But otherwise agree, and this was just the right amount of ""sober"" thought in this. It was a dude’s rom-com.  A rom-com for dude’s. This movie is really deep when you strip away the silly parts.

Two people creating the most advanced AI? One that can have feelings and evolve through time? Aspirations? One of the creators being in love with the other? 

Said creator making one of the characters' motivations to be longing for what equates to the creator's crush? 

That NPC gaining sentience from the love toward this special person?? SAID special person joining the game and sharing feelings with an artificial intelligence? 

It's like another take on the movie ""Her"" but with different twists and ideas applied to it. Honestly, I miss rom-coms. I hope this increases the chances of a new boom of good rom-coms. They prolly just used the Disney GPS tracker in his neck to see when he's out for coffee then surprised him with a camera crew and offered him 500k and free coffee to say one line on film. I can imagine to some extent at this point Ryan Reynolds just needs to call a studio and ask if they want him to print some money for them That answers that! Thanks. I loved how this is finally the movie that brought Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi [together](https://youtu.be/QMWTAYfrUX4) for the first time and they put out a good movie. Did Guy use Mega Man's arm cannon, when fighting in Channing Tatum's hideout?

I like the more subtle references, but sometimes they're so subtle it's difficult to catch them.  Also, what was on the bumper stickers, on all the police cars? It used them lightly, and didn't spoil them on advance in the marketing.

That said, I kinda wish they'd stuck to gaming references over the obvious Marvel/Star Wars gags. It’s because they earned our respect on their own before cashing in on something like that. Then they didn’t overdo it. Just two amazing ones back to back that made perfect sense in the setting and then it was over. There's less of the snark but id say a lot of the jokes still feel a lot like a Ryan Reynolds type of joke I somehow, even though I've seen several trailers, don't recall seeing that. But Reynolds did mention it in an interview a few times Kip up

Kip up

...yeah That’s a great point, I hasn’t thought about that and straight up cringed at the Willis line too but I think you’re on to something with him feeling that need to basically rip other people off to make himself notable. The line was still cringe, but at least I’m convinced there was some thought behind it now lol And if you want to lay it thick, have him accompanied by some OnlyFans gamestream groupies as the outdated ideal of the gamedev lifestyle And those stupid streetwear jackets that they had him wear, it fit the character, it just showed how hard he was trying to fit into a world that he really did not understand about gaming Adios. Turd nuggets That entire fight was great but definitely screams of being a reshoot to add some action. Pure guesswork though, don’t take my word. Jack Donaghey would be proud. That surprises me, I just got out of the theatre in SK and it didn't get a response.

I guess it doesnt really surprise me though, since the two biggest reactions I've seen from crowds here are when Evans picks up Mjolnir and when Daniel Craig told Evan's that his 'ancestral home' was bought in the 1980s from a Pakistani businessman. I'm a glutton for pain and punishment... Give me season 1 Villanelle all day FRIENDLY GESTURE! For entire time he was in all i had in mind i want to make caption meme, he represents cyberpunk ceo perfectly I get it. Dude obviously didn’t see Guy as a sentient being. But once he learnt Antwan stole from his friend he did the right thing. Yall don't know tech bros do you?

He saw the wind shift and followed the money. He ends up ditching Antwan the second he realizes he'll make more money with keys. His trying to jump up from a prone position was hilarious To add to what the other guy said, ADR is when they have an actor re-record their lines after filming has stopped. Because the recording conditions are different, there's sometimes a noticeable change in sound quality. 😂 Or go the Wreck it Ralph route and have Guy go out into the Internet. Where he becomes Skynet. The Avengers theme was fantastic.  Biggest laugh in my theater when it cut to Chris Evans. Definitely gonna watch it a couple more times. Really wasn't expecting that. That was great. “What the shit?!?” Car changing colors did it for me.

And the teabagging And how he fucking glitched into the wall and started stuttering. That part killed me Definitely several re-watches only to catch those background shenanigans and the steroids lol I saw that Whey Protein in his inventory. It's great when there is a lot of attention to detail. Especially funny for Dude who was only half done as a character. Agee. Sends out a good message that sometimes you don't end up with the person you love and that's okay. To me it showed that he actually overcame his original programming.

Getting the girl isn't his sole purpose anymore, so he can be happy with his life and create his own future. Free guy 2: Freemium he should have been hyped up. my hot take is that he was the best performance of FOXCATCHER and was the only guy in that movie not to get an oscar nom smh I saw the same thing with Adam Sandler, where he's like... very aware that a lot of his movies are trash. The guy is actually fairly talented but he knows what people want from him and he does it, and i think he's started to share the whole ""lazy hack"" attitude towards himself the internet has I thought that sounded like Tina Fey It's the awkwardly stilted delivery of that line that straight-up murders me Yes!! That was my absolute favorite line of the movie!!!! I wish they made the third item ""aaa"" or ""asdf"". As a writer I felt personally attacked And I am pretty sure I spotted a quick cameo from a warthog at the beginning I think it was also how they were also allowed to do the Deadpool/Korg spoof promo for the movie My fiancée did that to me. I don’t game at all but it was so fun to see him get all giddy with the references and cameos! And >!John motherfucking Krasinski!< was the shadowy gamer. God, the cameos in this were *so much fun*... shit, >!they even got Alex Trebek in there!!< And turn his hand into hulk fist Top 75 for me, no doubt He only recently started swearing, I don’t think he’s ready to drop an F-bomb. That’s basically why Matt Damon had his cameo as the “Scotty Doesn’t Know” singer in *Euro Trip*.  He knew the filmmakers and was in the Czech Republic making *The Brothers Grimm*. As an actor, part of the issue is that it's not just your decision. Once you're a union actor there are contracts that have to go through your agent and you legally can't just pop onto a set for a few minutes and appear in something for fun. I'm sure a lot of people would be down for this on principle but logistically it can be a huge headache, especially when you're dealing with big studios. I think one of the things that made Trebek an amazing host of Jeopardy is that he understood that every topic he covered had someone who was passionate about it. He probably didn't know a lot of the things that came up, but someone somewhere not only knew it but was damn proud of knowing it, and he seemed to understand that. He also did really well making people feel comfortable on that stage and showing an actual interest in them while they were on the show. >!Shh. Disney needs to ~~steal~~ buy off the *Terminator* rights first...!< I thought it was fine. The real cringe worthy moment was the nerdy virgin gamer trope screaming about his cum sock to his mom Bit late now but did you not feel old when he mentioned her humming that CLASSIC Mariah Carey song? You're right, and I thought that while watching too. But it'd be hard to make much of a movie if they had actual full god mode powers, probably. We could rationalize that they're low level customer service agents who don't get full god mode privileges, perhaps.

That still leaves the fact that the CEO or a higher up never try it. Continuing down this line of thought, maybe because he didn't code the foundations of the game they don't actually know how to backdoor into God mode. Sorry to jump in so late, just watched it.

&#x200B;

My impression was that writers/director/other crew definitely know video games, but were trying to toe the line between giving references for gamers and making it accessible to just anyone out seeing the movie, and so sometimes they came up short. Honestly I could forgive the bridge physically being built as just Guy's perception of the world he lives in, after all the graphics aren't really that great but for Guy they're lifelike, but when they showed the bridge being built on screen, it felt really fake. Eli5? Level 69 Fart Thief He came off way too cartoonish compare to the rest of the cast. hammed the shit outta that role lol I thought it was strange and didn't fit the tone. Only funny in a ""What the hell?"" way. No he didn’t. That was his son. Albuquerque Boiled Turkey got a solid laugh out of me though. He went through a pretty hard divorce too.. could've been a rough few years for him You can't get the time back. He has plenty of cash.

I forgot what a sweetass dancer he is. He's like 40. I saw this comment and thought I just saw him in 22 Jump Street and then I realised that was 7 years ago! Where did all that time go? Yeah didn’t expect him to be one of the heroes They were going to have him have a more typical “bully” arc (like Billy’s in Season 2 I would guess, except I think Steve was supposed to die), but they figured out pretty quickly that Keery was better utilized as a fundamentally decent person. As if being hot and charismatic wasn’t enough, he’s also a brilliant songwriter, and the [record he put out last year](https://youtu.be/SDQXXiWm6u0) is legitimately one of the best psych-pop albums I’ve heard in a long time. (His [newer single](https://youtu.be/Zy1V76nFkh4) fuckin’ rips, too). Same. I was fully expecting at least one of them to get hit for some reason and was so relieved when it didn't happen. I also expected it to happen with Guy and Buddy and I'm glad it didn't happen there either She said he found the button. Pretty sure you'd need at least two people typing on one keyboard to pull that off Thank you so much! That was one of the things the programmer liked about her is that she sang that song, so he wrote that into his code. I was wondering about that myself. Yeah that's why I was also kinda disappointed by that. Why would Guy remember everything by being kissed if the whole program was reset? That’s what made it so fun imo. That and it was genuinely an alright movie, they may have fucked around but it was a fun fucking around not straight shit >2d

Apparently that's what they did. Went through Reynolds' phone and asked people to cameo in his movie. And then it pulls back again to be another layer of the Matrix leading into Matrix 4. that shit made no sense to me... like they are servers right just pull the plugs!!!?? *Guy’s rom-com 

XD ""Catchphrase!"" Agreed. Once you realized Keys made Guy, pining for the perfect girl, but Keys wasn’t just pining, he also *knew* all those little things she loved. I wanted to shake Millie and make her realized the dude loved her. Yeah, Millie absolutely got the better part of that deal in the server room. She lost out on a few million in licencing fees in exchange for complete ownership of the first Artificial General Intelligence. That is MASSIVE. It could instantly automate the jobs which account for well over half of the US's GDP. Soonami's board are going to lose their minds when they find out Antwon traded the singularity for some games. I agree, although it’s overall a silly movie they did have some interesting questioned posed about AI and what ‘real’ is.

That part almost felt like Black Mirror to me, where they pose a question about advances in technology and how we can use it for good or evil. The Guy character could just as easily been turned into one of those “virtual assistants” from Black Mirror who are fully sentient but trapped inside a cube for eternity to complete boring tasks for their human overlords.

Another part I liked was how they made parallels between the AI in the game and real life. We look at these NPCs and laugh at their lack of free will and how they repeat the same routine every day, but then once you step back and look at your own life you also wake up, eat, and go to work every day with little variation.

There’s an actual philosophical theory that shows how we don’t have any free will in practice because although we have the POTENTIAL to do other things, we don’t. Everyone realizes that they could quit their job tomorrow and make a new life for themselves, but they don’t. I don’t know the real stats, but I am guessing he is in the top bankables actors right now. Having him in your movie is a very good bet. And they don’t interact once Mega Buster! I've been a hard-core Megaman player since I was 3 years old, so I definitely appreciated that reference. You could argue that marvel and star wars gags are still gaming references, lightsabers and caps shield have both been just randomly thrown into fortnite in a very similar manner. I somehow wasn’t even aware this was a FOX film so seeing the Captain America shield and Lightsaber was a genuine “what the fuck” moment to me (in a good way). I guess I just completely tuned out the FOX logo at the beginning because I don’t even remember it if there was one. I work in corporate and he taught me everything I know My three favorite things are kicking ass, tbd and third item here. Kip up

Kip up

....yeah The problem with adr is that if you don’t know what it is you never notice it but once you do you hear it EVERY TIME Oh yeah that was my favorite moment. Same. That whole scene alone guaranteed I'm going back. I was laughing so hard at the shield and then the Avengers theme that I almost missed Chris Evans and the Hulk hands I laughed even harder at the >!hulk hands!< and the villain's reactions. LOL perfect follow-up. that one scene had me in hysterics. And then he pulled out a lightsaber, and the Star Wars theme played. Same, and then the lightsaber got a good bit of laughing and cheers. > The Avengers theme was fantastic

And then Star Wars! Lots of SW and Marvel references. I assume the movie was produced by part of the Disney conglomerate. I think it was a reference to an actual glitch in GTA that makes you invincible. Agreement text He did end up with someone he loved, though. It just wasn't romantic. I liked the breakup too. Not ""dramatic"" and tearjerking but to see just a regular mature breakup between two adults is kind of original lol … but then sometimes you can use created life to convince somebody who has expressed zero romantic interest in you to suddenly fall madly in love with you and that’s OK too Finally someone who agrees with me! Eh

Nobody *made* him make Grown Ups 2. Like he’s trying to convince himself this is what he wants. So good. Or ""Foo"" and ""Bar"" Lauren impsum or something like that too. Its amazing they got Trebek, and definitely dates when the film was made.

Great now I'm sad... When was Krasinski in it? I cant think of when I saw him or who that character description is. I was hoping for a Mark Ruffalo cameo after that…maybe him being really chill about it instead. And then whip out another iconic weapon. That was a whole musical number not a cameo. Why do I still remember that song, I havent watched the movie for like fifteen years. Holy crap the ipo is owned by a French company with 38 billion in assets. Although the ""you're 22 living at home, there is no god"" was pretty funny Thought it was pretty funny scene, the guy who plays the character is very good at playing a degenerate So the way reflections used to work before RTX reflections and realtime raytracing became reasonably possible in video games, Game developers used to use something called Cubemaps.

Cubemaps are like a 360 degree screenshot of an environment that you would apply as either a skybox or just as a reflection to all objects within an environment. This would make objects look like it's reflecting the environment around it.

So when you play an older game (for example most halo games) and come across a shiny object that is reflecting its environment, you're looking at a cubemap.

So to explain the reference, sometimes levels get cut, however the cubemaps generated from them remain uncut and occasionally a developer would decide to use that cubemap in a different environment simply because they like the lighting or they fit the environment better.

&#x200B;

Here's an example in halo 4 of a halo 3 cubemap being used as a reflection:

[https://youtu.be/3cax9Q6pFlQ?t=38](https://youtu.be/3cax9Q6pFlQ?t=38) exactly, it fell a bit off - all the characters are realistic, event he NPC ones, and his is not It perfectly fit the tone of over the top and inappropriate founder that he portrays throughout the movie That line sounded perfectly Taika.

Also, happy cake day! Being in Albuquerque having watched that, the theater had a good laugh over it. Definitely. Dude has the best redemption arc in season one. I was watching through it with a friend and we both expected to hate him, but the character had a pretty quick (and surprisingly natural) turn around to be awesome. One of the better jokes, was great hearing the women in the theater laugh before the men. I can answer this! They explicitly say the data was still on the server, he'd just been disconnected from it by the reset. So the kiss snapped him out of the loop, and he hit the branches he'd made

it's sketchy logic on the programming side, but basically they reconnected him to all the stored paths he'd grown thank God he doesn't know Kevin Hart, or else he would have been Buddy. She was too busy trying to her cheeks clapped by an NPC, can't blame her Key's life definitely parallel's Guy's. Having a friend who was perfectly complacent about his situation and working a corporate job only to find himself distracted by Millie and grows to become someone who was willing to put his whole work on the line. A shame Wakiti didn't emerge as the final boss in game as a giant rock golem who messed with the code directly because of how little he thought of guy as a digitally sentinent life and decide to play god At least they had some iteration of the Portal Gun. That gave me a smile. Didn't the lightsaber turn into that staff thing from fortnite? i believe it was just 20th Century Studios logo, and it only stuck out to me because it made me realize why Deadpool and Korg did a commercial/skit together for the movie (beyond being played by actors in the film). It is cursed knowledge, like knowing about kerning or the Wilhelm Scream. Catchphrase I was so afraid that both the street scenes at the end would end with a car crash! This was actually so refreshing. Are you saying Millie never had feelings for Keys? Lorem All of the videos in the game were dated in July from last year >!In the montage of Guy's rise, I believe.!< “Even he gets a hulk movie.” because scotty doesnt know Oh, good. Don't want my man Paddington going to the bloody Mouse. Yeah the bit itself while predictable was fairly funny. But the specific scene with the sock was god awful He also killed it as the Henchperson of Indeterminate Gender in Netflix's Series of Unfortunate Events. I need this ELI5 even more... NPC Ryan Reynolds, key point there Eh I never bought for a second the fact that Key and the Indian dude were friends. Dude was a douche until the last few mins. And Gravity Gun The Halo Scorpion tank was in the background of a couple shots Yes, it turned into one of the Fortnite harvesting tools. I didn't get the feeling that she did. *He* did for her, sure, but watching the movie, I didn't feel like it was reciprocated until the last scene with them.

The way I saw it, Guy told her that he was programmed by Keys, and she... almost like she flipped a switch, and seemed to redirect the feelings she had for Guy to Keys? Idk, it was kinda weird for me. Lol I will start using Lauren now. okay. So a long long time ago, in video games you can't buy today, Game developers looked at shiny metal balls and thought ""This needs a reflection!"" But all the little microchips just couldn't handle it. So the developers thought ""I know! Why don't we just take a picture of everything and put it on a cube, and tell the game that it's a reflection!""

And the game developers lived happily ever after. ^(Well some did...) Yeah that part confused me a bit at the end too. The film doesn’t really establish that they’re friends, just coworkers, and the entire movie he screws over Keys and does everything Antoine asks him with no hesitation. 

He only has a change of heart once Waititi literally confesses to him that he stole the code. Like dude, you didn’t believe your friend at all this entire time? I believe Metal Gear REX was walking around at some point, too. Very romcom cliche, I didn't appreciate the ending that much This helps. Thank you Exactly! Even then, those two wer ejust coworkers. Indian dude completely dismisses Keys dream when they're in the snack room. They're not friends in the slightest. That ending was so far out of left field. They could've saved that development for a sequel.

I feel like the only real chemistry in this movie was the romances between key and millie and millie and her guy. Even guy and buddy kinda phoned it in. That's not to say I didn't enjoy guy and buddy's scenes together, it's just that buddy was the black best friend and nothing more. I didn't even realize he hadn't shown up at the end until Guy mentions it smh. I did love the little fact that their color scheme at the end when they kiss is the same as the game. 

Keys is wearing the blue shirt while Mille is in a similar getup to her avatar wearing white. ",0
64,"I really enjoyed the movie, the first part of the movie felt like typical romcom, predictable but very comforting. And the second part, especially when the sisters argued, it felt really heavy and cathartic in a positive way.

The redemption part felt little bit rushed for me and I kinda wished Riley (Aubrey Plaza) arc got resolved. That being said I really like the chemistry of between her and Kristen Stewart, it was really charming. Also, I think Mackenzie Davies and Kristen Stewart chemistry was pretty good, especially in the beginning of the movie.

In the end, pretty refreshing romcom and I think Kristen Stewart should be in more romance and comedy movies.


Side Note: 

* I saw [this photo](https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Happiest-Season-Photo-by-Lacey-Terrell-1.jpg) few months ago, and it showed up again on Tipper's instagram I assume that Riley is seeing someone new and Clea Duvall is portrayed her.

* I also like that Jane (Mary Holland) and John (Dan Levy) became BFF. I really enjoyed this movie. Great cast (including smaller cameo parts), and a lot of very funny moments mixed into a cute feel good story. Wanted to get that out of the way so that my minor complaints don’t come off as too negative. However...

I *hated* that Harper repeatedly left Abby alone at parties where she didn’t know anyone, or sent on outings with family members she’d just met, or ditched her to stay out late at a bar with her old friends. It made me so uncomfortable. Separately and independently from everything about her family issues and closetedness, she was just an inattentive partner and bad friend to Abby, who she’d brought into this very awkward and uncomfortable situation in the first place. I feel like they spent too much screen time showing her being a bad partner to strain their relationship and not enough showing why they were good together in a relationship to begin with. 

Also, Jane was very clearly the best member of that family from the start. The most heartbreaking moment wasn’t about any of the romantic or family relationships, it was when Jane’s absolutely beautiful painting got destroyed. And the most gratifying (albeit heavily telegraphed) moment was after the time jump when her novel was a bestseller. Dan Levy’s scene about coming out to your family was such an emotional scene. He stole any scene he was in. I just read [this article](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/11/happiest-season-clea-duvall-queer-rom-com-1234599465/)

> Late in the film, Harper’s sexuality is unmasked — without her consent — to her entire family, the kind of big revelation scene that has populated many a rom-com, but “Happiest Season” gives it a painful twist. Harper doesn’t use the moment to finally come out, but to pull herself deeper into the closet. It’s heartbreaking for Abby, and the kind of disruption to genre expectations that makes the film so special.
> 
> “We all have our baggage, we all have our main triggers and our fight or flight responses, and I think Harper is someone who was like operating in this certain way for a long time,” DuVall said. “It’s this devastating moment where your instincts kick in and you realize that you have not come as far as you thought you have, because you haven’t really confronted yourself. It’s a very humbling moment and something that I think we can all relate to, no matter what it is we’re overcoming. You don’t overcome it on the first try.”

Yeah, this made me understand that reveal your queerness is not as easy as you think, especially when you can't predict their reaction

> As Abby flees from the scene, it’s John who catches up with her. Instead of tossing off some sassy witticisms, Levy’s character instead offers an emotional and introspective assessment of the situation, one that leans heavily on some necessary empathy.
> 
> “I wrote this speech about coming out, because I was thinking about how we can have compassion for Harper in that moment,” DuVall said. “She does do something that is pretty bad and I can see why an audience would be upset with her, but it’s also about wanting to have compassion for people who are going through that. Coming out is so different for everybody. For some people, it’s super easy and I think that’s great for them, but for a lot of people, it’s really not.”

Yeah, glad that she gave Dan Levy (John) one of the most gut-punching moment in the movie, he really delivered on that. I think I’m too used to seeing Plaza in an evil/crazy role...I fully expected her to tell everyone they were lesbians. Glad she didn’t. I wish there was more of her in this film. 

Also 

“Did you celebrate Christmas at the orphanage?” Yo... the closet is rough, I get that. But the closet doesn't make you ignore your girlfriend, spend all night with an ex, and then call her ""smothering"" when she calls you on it. The hell was this movie

Like, it sets up the premise like it's gonna be a lot of wacky misunderstandings, but all the conflicts and misunderstandings are not even remotely played like they're supposed to be funny. Weirdly dark movie, just weird all around. The movie suffered from making Harper too evil and the parents too nice. We're constantly told how horrible the dad is and I just didn't see it. He's not depicted as a good person, but if you want to justify Harper's awfulness, you needed to make the parents worse.  Also you can't have Harper be the favorite child, I feel like Harper's behavior would have been slightly more justifiable if the parents kept fawning over Allison Brie and ignoring Harper. 

I'm not the first person to say this, but this needed to be a braver movie where Harper and Abby just break up. A lot of Harper being a bad partner had little to do with her parents. Leaving Abby at all the parties, being jealous and hypocritical, etc.  

If you have to end this movie with Harper and Abby together, cut out some moments of Harper being cruel to Abby, change the whole beginning to flesh out Harper and Abby and show why they are together, and have Allison Brie be the favorite child and not Harper. I really want to see the movie Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza thought they were making I think the biggest problem is they didn't do enough to get people invested in Abby and Harper's relationship. All they get you to do is like Abby (you know, she doesn't like Christmas but is willing to put that aside, shes gonna propose) but then you spend over an hour watching her get dumped on by a never ending parade of shitty, toxic assholes. So you could give a rat's ass about them fixing their relationship, you'd rather just see Abby get the hell out of there. Then they rushed into trying to tie a little bow into redeeming this crappy family before it felt earned.

I spent the entire back half of the movie hoping Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza would run off together. Let them bond over what an asshole Harper is.

(But I liked Dan Levy) Personally wanted Abbey to get with Riley. Hated Harper and she didn't do enough to redeem her behaviour imo. Thought that family was terrible and felt so sorry for Jane. I'm so glad her book got published. “I have a way with routers” Overall I really enjoyed it but where they lost me was at the very end. There was so much toxic build up, Abby was hurt so much. If they wanted Abby and Harper to stay together, they should have at least did a small time jump...something like— Abby does leave and goes home. Stays with a friend and she runs back into Harper on NYE..

We see Harper working things out with her parents before then and really digesting her behavior and how she fucked up. Then they agree to try again and we see them all happy and together again next Christmas. 

I did still feel for Harper, coming out can be so incredibly scary and painful as Levy’s character so aptly pointed out. But Harper needed some time to work on it instead of them just going “Oh cool, poof it’s all better now”. Thoughtful/constructive commentary aside, I just really liked the height difference between Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis. Either Kristen is tinier than I've realised, or Mackenzie is basically an Amazon. I wonder if anyone (while filming) brought up the fact that they made Harper almost too unlikable in this. 

They kind of kept piling on reasons for people to dislike her. I can see why everyone was rooting for the Abby/Riley pairing, simply because Abby was consistently being hosed by the writers throughout the movie. This movie had the chance to be great and it blew it. It needed to make the bold move and it settled for the sappy ending instead.

Abbey deserved so much better and Harper was legit awful. I know it’s about her struggle feeling like she has to choose between her family or her girlfriend, but that’s just like... I don’t know.

Abbey should’ve ended up going home with John and starting over completely or she should have gotten with Riley. Harpers parents were straight up shitty people with no redeeming qualities and them suddenly being ok with everything at the end was absurd and also makes Harpers feeling extremely stupid, Harper was a selfish asshole too, she constantly treated Abby like shit and was completely oblivious to how her parents were treating her. Doesn’t matter if she’s terrified of her parents disowning her. Fuck them anyway they were extremely toxic and writhe with mental abuse. There's something about Christmas movies having the worst families, they were all terrible to each other. I loved the supporting cast and mostly had fun, but I think everyone in the family ended up a bit too unlikeable. Overall, not an awful way to spend a lazy Friday and better than a lot of the Christmas romcom garbage out there. This is one of the better Christmas movies in awhile in my opinion. Side note: is it bad that I wanted Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plazas characters to get together instead? Can we get a sequel around the best characters, John (Dan Levy) Riley (Aubrey Plaza) and Jane (Mary Holland), the latter of whom deserved SO MUCH better? They can all wingman/wingwoman each other. 

Like it can be around Harper and Abby hosting Christmas or having a Christmas wedding, whatever. I liked it. And I feel like a lot of folks in this comment section are falling prey to that most Reddit of behaviours, looking at one bad time and suggesting someone throw their entire relationship out.

The opening picture montage tells us that Abby and Harper have been together, and happy, for over a year; Abby moved in six months ago, and things have gone so well she's planning to propose. Aside from a bit of awkwardness on their date, every indication is that this is a happy, functional couple. 

And then they visit Harper's family. After just a couple of days of being closeted and surrounded by toxic people Abby wants to get out of there, and who can blame her? These people suck! She's not at all wrong to leave that party, or to tell Harper it's over at that point. But Abby's feeling punchy and angry and off-balance after just a few days of hiding herself around strangers; why are we surprised that Harper is an even worse mess when she's doing it with her family? Of course she's acting shitty, look at the environment she was raised in! When she's in the city with Abby and John she can be her actual self, but in her parents house she reverts to being the paranoid closeted lying teenage trainwreck she was.

And if she'd stayed that way, Abby would've been entirely right to walk away and never look back. But, and this is the important part, Harper doesn't stay that way; she recognizes that she's been shitty to Abby, she admits her mistakes and apologizes and promises to do better. And as we see literally the next day, when she's openly cuddling with Abby on the couch, and when Abby is invited into the family picture, there is change and their is improvement. And if someone is working to change, is it really so wrong to give them another chance?

I liked Happiest Season because it does what romcoms so rarely do; show a couple actually working through a problem and coming out the other side. 

Also, because Dan Levy. But who doesn't like Dan Levy? Jane stole every scene. Which is impressive when she’s the only actress I hadn’t seen anything of beforehand. Harper failing to save Abby from falling off the roof was basically a spoiler for how the rest of the movie would go. Consistently failing her girlfriend in like every department lol, really wish they went for a bold ending where they broke up. I was really happy when Kristen Stewart's character walked out and her girlfriend thought everything would be better when she told everyone.

I kind of wish they ended on that. I know it wouldn't be very christmassy, but I feel like rom coms should end that way sometimes. first of all can i just point out how GOOD kristen looked during the white elephant party. like the half buttoned shirt and eye makeup and hair and everything holy crap she shouldve left harper to date ME!

yeah anyways i loved abby john and jane but harper? ew no gross!

sloane did not need to be redeemed shes an asshole who outed her own sister outta jealousy..

harper also did not need to be redeemed at all. shes terrible, toxic, manipulative, mean, a hypocrite and bitchy. like yeah being closeted is hard but thats no excuse?! for being a terrible gf??!

honestly i really hoped abby would’ve left harper for riley. they have wayyyy more chemistry! also john and janes friendship is everything i love them so much

overall funny movie but the ending was super unrealistic so 6/10 Jane's reaction to her painting getting destroyed was the biggest gut punch. I teared up. have the major gripe with it as everyone else but all will be forgiven when Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza make out in some indie in a couple years

onto the positives: like all the best rom-coms it’s a secret horror movie, Mary Steenburgen is hilarious, few actors are as good at Kristen Stewart at communicating emotional devastation without making a big show of it, Mary Holland rules, Dan Levy made me cry once again, and Aubrey Plaza/Kristen Stewart at the drag bar was one of my favorite scenes of the year.

Mackenzie Davis continues to be weirdly used in movies but when her character wasn’t being a rom-com monster she was quite good, and she had some terrific moments at the end. still seemed a little bit miscast though - for some reason Mary Elizabeth Winstead kept coming to mind as someone who might've been a better fit. Harper was unlikeable for 80% of this film lol This movie was just watching poor Abby be treated like absolute trash by the entire family. Harper was so mean and selfish the entire time, there was nothing redeeming about her character or chemistry in that relationship. But damn did Aubrey plaza and Kirsten Stewart have chemistry I knew it would have been a weird pivot but I still was hoping they would get together. They should just take out all the lame characters and make a movie with Riley Abby John, and Jane. Pretty fun movie, had some issues with it. I felt like KStews character had so much more chemistry with Aubrey Plaza. 

Also I feel like Allison Brie's character got off light for outing MacKenzie Davis. Outside of that, pretty nice movie. I cried a little bit when they broke poor Jane’s painting. It was so cute and she was so proud of of :( John's line towards, when he told Abby that Harper not coming out had nothing to do with her love for Abby. And then explaining how everyone's experience is different. Besides that moment and the parts with Jane, very few saving graces for this film tbh. It was okay. I know it was going for that situational family comedy but the whole family was really unlikable and not in a quirky way. I also didn't think Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis had the best chemistry but Harper was also hard to root for at times so that probably didn't help. I actually agree with everyone else praising Aubrey Plaza. I wouldn't have been upset if the film took a turn and the lead got with her instead. Even at the end I was hoping they'd show her character one more time for a resolution. I think the early romcom framing is throwing people *way* off in how to process Harper's stuff later on. You're not meant to like her decisions - she doesn't even like them! - you're meant to understand they're way out of character compared to the usual flow of their relationship, that's the point. The movie could maybe have done a little more to show us their relationship before that stage to catch any stragglers, but I was surprised it seemed to be lost on so many commenters.


I still keep seeing people get hung up on the ""suffocating me"" bit though for example, but that was very obviously about her and her family rather than Abby? 

Idk, it just feels like a lot of people wailing on Harper haven't really given much thought before to what being in the closet actually costs or does to somebody. It does make them do lots of unsympathetic things, and they don't like themselves much for it either. Harper clearly isn't enjoying the person she's making herself here any more than Abby is. And the fact her family fucked Sloane up so much too makes me inclined to think she wasn't actually being that irrational in her fears about them. Critics went reaaally easy on this. So many lousy sitcom-y set pieces and Gags that make no sense or could be easily solved by basic communication. 

Also thought it let the family off way too easy in the end. Would've been better if the dad's financier decided to use the gay angle to virtue signal how ""progressive"" the dad was.

Also Kristen shouldn't have taken her back. 

Acting was good though and some good laughs.

I guess equality in its ultimate form is letting gays have the same generic slop the straights have had for decades lmao Sloane is an absolute piece of crap, though. If she was my sister, she'd be dead to me. I got dragged into this movie on a date and I gotta admit I thought it was great.  Dan Levy crushed the scene about coming out to your parents, particularly when it was so heartfelt and serious after he'd been established as the goofy friend for most of the movie. Dan Levy acting straight at the party was literally the only joke I laughed at. I thought people calling it lesbian Get Out were exaggerating but they really weren’t. Rose and Harper even look the same lol [deleted] I wouldn’t mind the movie ending with Abby and Harper breaking up but not for Abby to end up with Riley, a person she just met, right after almost proposing to someone else. I wouldn’t mind it to be revealed during the time jump montage, though. I absolutely understand Dan’s speech to Abby about how coming out is such a personal experience and that it varies from being supported to getting kicked out and everything in between. I believe it’s so important to understand that many times someone’s inability to come out has nothing to do with their partner and everything to do with themselves. 

Harper wasn’t wrong for wanting to stay in the closet, it’s such a personal choice (she was absolutely wrong for outing Riley’s character though) but I also think Abby wasn’t wrong either. Her line “I want to be with someone that’s ready” is such a fucking important one. Often times were made to feel guilty for not wanting to date someone in the closet. And while you are not allowed to tell someone when and how they should come out, you most certainly are allowed to choose whom you love and “out” is an acceptable standard to have. I think that needs to be talked about more.

Harper coming out to her partners and telling Abby “no wait look see I did it I love you” and Abby responding with “I’m sorry it’s too late” was so...painful. But fair. I really wish Abby had left and Harper had had to deal with that. I think it would have made for a more impactful story if Harper was made to truly feel the effects of the pain she caused not only Abby, but Riley as well. Her “I’m so sorry” to Riley does not, in any way, make up for outing a teenager. Harpers character fell flat for me. 

I know it’s a movie and everything but I just feel they dropped the ball in the last 30 minutes. 

But I’m also a sucker for cheesy rom coms that take place during the holidays. And I’ve had a major crush on Kristen Stewart since she was in Twilight so I’ll take what I can get. A side thing I really enjoyed about this movie is how they tackle that Sloane's divorce.  She and her husband clearly love and admire each other but know it won't work.  You get that whole story and dynamic with a few looks they share, it's just really sweet. I enjoyed it for the most part but man it really could've used another 15 minutes redeeming Harper and her family i think harper is very flawed in some aspects but i also think that people are entirely too harsh on her. fear does crazy things to someone and i can empathize with that her fear of being outed in an unaccepting family. this film also ignited my love for kristen stewart again and i think about the line “stay out of it, sappho” all the fucking time. Why is winning this mayoral campaign in this small town such a big deal? How did the Dad afford that enormous house? Surely that didn't come from being part of the town council. Wasted potential: the movie 

I like complex, flawed characters but after the first 5 minutes Harper has basically an hour+ of treating her girlfriend like shit. Where’s the balance? Why are we supposed to root for them? They overdid it with the ex bf, leaving her alone at parties, staying out at night, the fight and smashing her sweet sister’s painting. If they’d just gone with the “lies to her parents cause she’s scared, but they’re in it together” it would’ve been a way better movie. That, or change the ending. 

Also, it’s somewhere stuck between comedy and drama. It’s not funny enough and people act too shit for it to be a pleasant romcom, but there’s too many ridiculous moments for it to be an effective drama. 

On the plus side, great cast, chemistry and a couple of laugh-out-louds, mostly from Dan Levy. 

6/10 [removed] Meh.

It felt like a reverse The Family Stone. They didn’t flesh out enough of the characters, so most seemed flat. Toxic relationship that the abuser gets away with their shittiness. Dan Levy’s monologue was the high point of the film. That ending was unrealistic and rushed. Not good at all. I wanted to like this, so much so I didn’t even watch the trailer. I figured it would be good, so no point spoiling jokes. But I’m walking away with no desire to rewatch. Great First and Second Acts. The third act was TERRIBLE. Completely rushed and poorly written. Everyone has a happy ending and completely abandon their irredeemable traits within 24 hours? Just a few more scenes showing the main characters grappling with a difficult choice before choosing the happy ending might’ve saved it. [deleted] Okay I went into this expecting it to be really bad and was very pleasantly surprised. It would actually be among my top holiday movies if it weren't for all the b.s. that it pulls in the last twenty minutes or so:

- Harper was forgiven *much* too easily after spending about 95 per cent of the movie being absolutely thoughtless and borderline cruel to the woman she supposedly loves, starting with putting her in that horrible situation in the first place. You can easily feel sorry for her (as a child of narcissistic parents, I know all too well the deeply-ingrained feeling that keeping them happy has to be your number-one focus at the cost of everything else) but it would have been better character development to have Abby leave her in the end (and get together with Riley, imo).

- Harper's sister was also forgiven too easily for forcing her out of the closet.

- After the brilliant conversation between Abby and John about the reality of coming out to your parents, having Harper's parents' homophobia magically cured to the point of them suddenly being written as different people felt *too* fairytale-y. Trying to redeem her mother who's been a monster the whole time by having her be like 'Oh I actually hate flowers and want to learn karate'? And the dad being like 'wow forget my lifelong ambition to become mayor, I've just realised my family is more important' felt right out of a bad 90s children's movie.

- Jane's realisation of 'I deserve better' came out of absolutley nowhere.

Ultimately I guess I wanted to see a relatable ending where the sisters bonded and realised they are valid and don't need the approval of their abusive parents, and waving a magic wand to have them turn into great parents on the spot instead was a bit disappointing.

Still cute though! 4/5. The stress of coming out does not excuse abusing your girlfriend for 4 days and lying to her for a majority of your relationship. It does not excuse outing your first girlfriend and then allowing your friends to bully her and not even apologize to her for TEN years. Harper did not bravely come out to her parents in defense of her girlfriend. She was outed by her sister during a fight and didn’t even know where her girlfriend was. She was terrible to Abby. Like, really really terrible. Like, you can’t fix it with a simple “I’m sorry” terrible. I’m not saying Harper was evil, I am saying that there are natural consequences for poor choices. The ONLY acceptable ending to this movie would have been Abby leaving Harper and her toxic family. They even could have even jumped to a year later, showing that Harper had done some growing and came out to her parents on her own. The movie could have ended with her and Abby getting a drink to catch up or something. I would have been okay with that. You don’t get to treat people like shit and then make up for it by doing the bare fucking minimum. Jesus Christ. That mending deserved time at the very least. Queer kids are supposed to grow up watching this movie? What message are they supposed to get? That it’s okay to be hidden, abused, and lied to as long as you get a half hearted sorry after?The most frustrating part is that the majority of the movie is fine. The supporting characters are great, the jokes are funny, and it’s one amazing cast. The last ten minutes are what really kill me. Abby should have left and Harper should have had an actual growth arc. Can we please just get a nice queer holiday movie? Where no one is abusive and we don’t have to settle? Is that too much to ask? Hello, ladies. I hope someone could help me. English is not my first language. What did Kristen mean when she said “I’m having this thing where if I stick my finger in my eye it, like, really hurts.” when she ran into Aubrey Plaza. Did she mean that she is crying? I'm crying idk if it's because it was really emotional or it's just that I want a girlfriend so bad This movie was great. I did love Aubrey Plaza’s character Iike everyone else, and I get the main character hate, but I do think it ultimately did a good job of showing just how engrained someone in the closet can be due to her family.

The final denial of Abby after Harper’s sister outed her was extremely crushing though and I thought that pretty ruined the character for me.

Mary Holland was also one of the best parts of the movie. Her lines were highlights of the script.

Basically every female in the movie looked hot as hell. Was Jane autistic? This is my pick for **Cutest Movie Of The Year**.

The first half feels like a more well produced Hallmark film but the 2nd half carries a lot of the strength. You feel it literally swing from cute but ok, to really good.

Also Aubrey Plaza, who isn't playing a comedic character, but rather a dramatic and emotional role is the best part of this film. Her character and her performance is the heart and soul of the film. I had high hopes going into this movie considering I like almost all the actors involved from previous works. While I get that the movie spent its time building to the brilliant Dan Levy “coming out is terrifying” speech it sacrificed any kind of meaningful romance between the two leads to get there. Harper’s main character traits are she is closeted and a liar. Beyond that, the movie doesn’t really show you why Abby would want to marry her let alone suffer a week of hell for the chance. If I were Abby and my partner told me the second before we left that she had lied about coming out and I needed to hang out in the closet to protect that lie I would have simply not gone on the trip, but then I guess there’d be no movie. First red flag for me was in the first five minutes when >!Abby was hanging from the roof and Harper didn't immediately try to lift her back up and save her from possibly breaking her legs, but instead....went down to try to...catch her?!< From that point on I was like, ""Abby get the FUCK outta there, you can do better."" Harper was terrible. For more reasons than one. She repeatedly left Abby in the dust with no regard even when the parental expectation was not in view. I’m pissed they stuck together just because Harper begged. She took too long. I get that it’s hard, but I’m not convinced they are even a good couple besides “they’re LESBIAN”. 

Harper did this exact same thing to Aubrey Plaza’s character, and not only that, but she OUTED Aubrey too save her own skin. And then she repeats it to the supposed love of her life. She lies repeatedly and lets the whole family mistreat Abby and then gets offended if Abby gets upset. Yeah, what a joke! Abby deserved so much better. The internet was right. Kristen Stewart should’ve dumped Harper and got with Aubrey Plaza.  
  
Also as someone who hasn’t watched Schitt’s Creek this was my first go round with Dan Levy and he is seriously good isn’t he? Hilarious and scene stealing then when he gets his moment he absolutely crushes it. I want a story about Harper and Abby healing and growing after the events of this movie. I would love to believe that that tacked on happily ever after epilogue could happen, but I just don’t buy it. Give me therapy for everyone. Give me Harper and Abby spending time apart and learning to be alone and happy in themselves (part of the reason Abby puts up with Harper’s bullshit is that her parents deaths have made her terrified of losing people. I want her to really really value and respect herself.) Give me Harper attempting to establish an honest relationship with her parents and sisters. Give me more Riley and Abby hanging out! Give me Harper prioritising Abby’s needs over those of her family or her own. Give me Harper recognising her own narcissistic traits and trying to be better. Give me a reason why Abby loves Harper - as opposed to Riley -  in the first place! Give me a redemption and maturation arc and I just might come around to liking these characters the way I want to. Make me believe that that happy ending could happen- or a happy ending !
Edit: oh, also, give me Harper’s parents suffering actual god damn CONSEQUENCES for their behaviour instead of an instant makeup. Give me a Harper, Jane and Sloan who actually question and challenge the family unit they’ve been forced to conform to their entire lives. Give me a valid reason WHY they would want to maintain relationships with their horrible parents. And if they choose not to, give me a look into how they spend their time the following Christmas. Give me a story about women coming out of the fog of being trapped in narcissistic relationships. Come to think of it, give me a reason why Abby would want to date someone who treats her sister so horribly and is apparently 2 seconds away from homicide at all times. THERAPY. THERAPY FOR EVERYONE. Give me an ending which is happy because the characters are fulfilled and able to be honest with themselves. Not an ending that is framed as happy because the family unit is together and that’s all that matters, right ? I’m so underwhelmed. I feel like this movie had so much potential and it just fell flat. I think this might be one of the shittest family ever presented on film.

K Stew definitely shouldn't have taken MacKenzie Davis back.

Still it was a lot of fun too watch and I cried like a baby at the end. Having an actress of Stewart's pedigree (the entire cast really but she's a major stand out) was really great. It's unbelievable that after all that toxicity Harper's parents became perfect supportive parents in less than 48 hours. I came out to my parents 5 years ago and they still refuse to meet my boyfriend. What glasses brand is Dan levy wearing (clear and gold frames)? I really liked this film overall but I think they would’ve done better with a few minutes of establishing them as a couple, to make the relationship stronger and worth fighting for. As it was there was just the one scene with Harper pushing for Christmas and then immediately doing a 180. It's rare that I watch a movie just because of good reviews, but I thought ""hey, it's gay, I'm gay, I like the actors, and maybe it will be a fun holiday thing."" I really wanted to like it.

I think the biggest issue is that it doesn't know what it wants to be and tries to do too much.

Is it a happy feel good LGBT Hallmark movie? Is it a story about self-acceptance? Is it a story about overcoming relationship issues in the face of prejudice? Is it a slapstick comedy with caricature characters? Was it a comment on heteronormative relationship culture? Family drama? Political grandstanding? 

There is just so much going on and all of it comes off half-baked. From Stewart's character's needlessly tragic backstory to the family's eventual come together moments. It's off. [deleted] I think I need a short film of Jane and John working together on Jane‘s book. I want to see her pitch to to him. Final Drafts, book release party, book tour. I think that the real story here. Maybe I’m projecting here, but if I were Abby I would have ran off with Riley and said fuck all this. But that might be my giant crush on April Ludgate/Aubrey Plaza talking. Just came here to say two things: 

1) The reason why the audience is confused about who Abby should end up with is because the audience spends as much screen time with Harper and Abby as it does Riley and Abby. Either we should have spent more time with Harper in the beginning to know she had redeeming qualities, or the movie should have just let Abby walk away from a toxic relationship.

2) The reason Harper was so toxic was directly pointed out in one of their final confrontations that her parents make her prove her worth to earn their love. The father is a full blown narcissist, and the characters go out of their way to avoid saying so, instead saying things like ""we have to earn your love"" or ""you care so much about reputation"".

The fact that the movie tried to redeem both Harper and the father in the last ten minutes of the movie really bothered me. Anybody else think that Abby was going to end up with Riley? I have a lot of thoughts that have already been shared here but basically, there were two ways this could have gone - either A. Harper is a horrible girlfriend, Abby should leave her and get with Riley, or B. Harper is also a victim of the situation and Abby is right to forgive her - I feel like the movie didn't quite commit to either and that's why the ending doesn't feel satisfying.

Overall, I still liked ""Happiest Season"" and I loved being able to watch a lesbian Christmas movie with my girlfriend. I so appreciate that Hulu actually put in some real money and effort to the production and promotion of this movie. Clea Duvall did a great job. The premise was great but the execution was half assed and full of cliches. From what I gathered from the trailer I thought it would be about Kristen Stewart learning about her girlfriend from her ex. But around the half point of the movie for me, it took a nosedive into another ordinary christmas movie. If you just took out the LGBT parts it would be forgetful. 
The only redeeming part for me was John. At the start, he felt like a stereotypical gay friend but he stole every scene in the movie, especially when he supports Abby when she left the house. 
Overall it was a bad movie with some good scenes for me. Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart had very little chemistry.

Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza on the other hand....oooh boy. 

They need to be in more stuff together. Really enjoyed this film. Loved all of the cast. Aubrey Plaza was the unexpected standout for me.

Dan Levy also had some great moments. Dan Levy was great and he was easily the best part of the movie for me.

Also whoever the ex husband was and Jane. 

Probably my favorite people. The ending seemed forced though. I just realized this movie is basically Lez Bomb with better acting and worse pacing. Sorry, but Abby and Riley should have gotten together. Harper was awful. I liked the movie even though it had its issues. Riley’s speech about how hard it is to love someone in the closet who couldn’t accept themselves for who they are BROKE me because I was in a similar situation and it’s so painful. 

Aubrey Plaza stole the whole movie for me. 

I just wish we got to learn more about Harper and got to see her more fleshed out and her more positive qualities so that I could actually root for her and Abby’s relationship. Harper was an asshole through the whole movie, and in no way made up for it. Also that throw away line she said about how she found Kristen ""John taught me about trackers"" NO lol

John is Kristens friend, not Harper's, and Kristen just found out about the tracker the day she left, meaning there's no way Harper talked with John about trackers let alone buying one and using one.  Stupid line, and if it were real then would've been further reason to break up with her cause that's an obsessive level of paranoia towards her gf. I know it's a joke for the audience, but it made no sense in the internal logic of the movie.

Last thing, the phone call at the end was contrived. The writers prioritized convenience over truth/reality. If he wanted the job he would've had to hide his gay daughters sexuality? Lmao is this movie set in the 70s or something? His character is conservative, but conservatives don't care if his daughter is gay (Dave Rubin is famous on the right and he is gay and married. despite common belief hardly anyone cares who you have sex with). In fact, in reality and not Hollywood illogical narrative, having a gay daughter would be a political lottery, it would gain this conservative candidate some liberal voters in addition to his conservative base.

In conclusion, it was ok, not a great movie. The beginning had Get Out vibes lol. The ""funny"" character was mostly a miss, but near the end had one or two good moments. Considering the errors, some that I already mentioned, i don't see this movie being rewatchable. Honestly felt like a movie about Kristen Stewart being in a bad relationship, realizing she’s better than that, and ending up with Aubrey Plaza.
But we somehow should feel it’s alright for McKenzie Davis to basically ignore her the whole movie, and treat her like shit and just say in the end i’m sorry? Nah. It doesn’t work like that.
Especially when Stewart and Plaza are so awesome.
First time i’ve seen Dan Levy and he’s great, and a copy of his dad.
6/10. If Harper would’ve ended up with Riley - 7/10.
I bet if this was movie about a straight coupe, critics would be much more harsh to it [deleted] I enjoyed this movie, my biggest complaint was the slapstick comedy. I would’ve cared so much without the jokes. [deleted] Ehhhh it was ok. The happy family ending was totally unearned. I also didn’t understand why they had to sneak to each other’s rooms and shit. Would anyone bat an eye if 2 girls said they were hanging out in each other’s room and fell asleep? And the kids randomly framing Abby. Just too much drama for the sake of drama Really didn't agree with Abby taking back Harper in the end. She seemed unlikable, and just a bad partner to her, but a really enjoyable movie nonetheless. I loved it. Dan Levy killed me either with humour or tears in every scene. Kristen Stewart's performance was fantastic. I want to be Jane's friend.

It wasn't perfect though. I think it needed a bit more time to show us Abby and Harper together, and more of Harper realising that how she was treating Abby was wrong (because it was, but I'm going to give the girl growing up in an emotionally abusive household some time to finally kick the learned behaviours). I wasn't planning on watching this movie, but something about the trailer compelled me to give it a shot. I agree with the other comments saying Riley and Abby should've connected. Abby was treated like a criminal and was treated like a pity invite by Harper's parents. 

I'm glad Jane got a good ending. Did John and Jane become besties? I really enjoyed this film; loved the story, direction, and the cast. I am from a family with two other sisters, and the dynamic between the three sisters was hilariously accurate.

Another thing I noticed: There is a lot of criticism towards Harper's character (i.e., ditching Abby to hang out with her straight friends), which some sense, and the manner that she prioritized her family over Abby for a good part of the film. I want to share that coming out to family is so complicated—it is not a linear process. I am trying to see Harper's perspective with compassion and patience. I know some queer people who are incredibly close to their family, and they have put their queerness aside to maintain that connection and not lose their family. It's not my place to judge. I liked it because it really showed the complexity of the relationship, and the internalized shame vs the being forced back into the closet and how both women went through thier own journey.

 Both perspectives were valid, and raw, and honest. And complex with it's own unique baggage. I also like the happy ending, even though not every story ends that way in real life.

 It shows that you can go through messy, complicated conflicts, and not just throw away an entire relationship because of it. I've never seen Dan Levy in anything before and he was easily my favourite character. He's hilarious and his monologue was really moving.

Kristen Stewart is also really good in this film. Apart from Stewart and Levy, it's a cute but mediocre Christmas rom-com, but about a lesbian couple. It's nice that now there exists a mainstream lesbian rom-com, but it could've been better. The pacing is awkward, Davis and Stewart don't have much chemistry and Harper's family is too mean and their relationships are too toxic to make the sudden happy end believable.

7/10 (with a big sympathy bonus for Levy, Stewart and Aubrey Plaza) I really wanted to like this more than I did. It's a shame too, because the first 15 minutes or so are super cute and I was hopeful this would end up another holiday classic. That being said, I just think the tone of this ended up feeling off.

Yes, LGBTQ romance is definitely minimized in major film in comparison to hetero relationships, but did they have to go with the most basic plot ever by shoving one of the women into the closet? That story has been told 100 times. It's 2020, not 2002, surely there are other plots gay characters can have other than overcoming their fear of being outed. 

That being said, since they did pick this plot to pivot around, did they have to make Harper and her family the worst people on earth?? At first I was chuckling at how awkward everything seemed, but it just reaches a point where they're all so annoying and repugnant that I didn't want to see any of them redeemed (including Harper.)

There's something so annoyingly cloying and false to the resolution of this movie to me. Some relationships aren't worth saving. That can be a relationship with toxic parents or siblings too. I think in this case the happier ending would have been Abby ending up with Riley, and with Harper understanding that she needed time to learn to live her truth on her own. Mackenzie Davis’s character SUCKED. How fucking selfish can you be to ask your SO to come home for Christmas when you haven’t even come out to your parents? I get how frustrating and terrifying that can be and IS for many people, but this is 2020, not 2005. Having grown up conservative, I can say with a fair degree of certainty that unless your parents are the most hardline conservative people in the world, they’ll most likely accept the fact that you’re gay even if they’re not thrilled with it. I can even accept that dad behaving the way he did bc he was running for office: not an excuse, but I understand. For Davis to stand in the middle of the room and lie about being a lesbian after she just told Kay-Stew that she wanted to be with her is unforgivable. I would have broken up with her right there. Obviously for plot convenience they have to get back together but that is some straight up disrespectful, manipulative horseshit. Thank God for Dan Levy. I really enjoyed it, one of my favourite new Christmas releases in years, and actually really refreshing to see a positive, happy LGBT film. The whole cast were great, especially Dan Levy who was downright hilarious and, whilst I didn't think it was a perfect film, the ending still hit me like a motherfucker.

On a side-note, if anyone could recommend me any other positive LGBT films, I'd be more than grateful. Overall this was a cute and enjoyable holiday flick and I can see myself working this into the regular holiday schedule. That said, I  really wish they'd done little vignettes in place of the illustrations at the beginning. Another 10-15 minutes endearing us to Harper and Abby's relationship would've done a lot to make the audience care. All the best jokes were in the trailer

Otherwise decent movie I enjoyed this movie more because it really got me to hate most of the characters. It wasn’t bad by any means, just predictable but that’s okay. It was worth a watch due to being on Hulu. I’d recommend it to folks looking for an atypical Christmas movie. I don't know but it made me cry. awesome movei==ie Want to watch with kids, but saw a review that says it needlessly ruins the “Santa magic” of Xmas. Can anyone confirm? This movie was so bad I thought a straight man wrote it!! But I was very disappointed to find out it was written & directed by Clea DuVall. It was straight up boring and romanticized toxic behaviors and relationships...Terrible plot, terrible ending...The side characters are way more interesting then the main characters. It just completely lacks any reality and depth. What a bummer. Honestly, I’m so annoyed at hearing all of this “she should have dumped Harper for Riley!” stuff. I feel like this thread and the rest of Twitter are acting like random commenters on r/relationshipadvice. The moment something goes wrong, “leave them!!!!!!!!” 

For everyone bashing every move Harper made, I really hope you straight people are not judging someone on their fear of coming out. You don’t know what it’s like. I come from a very familiar conservative high pressure family that must always please their family and I was shaking to my core when i finally came out. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Would i have made the same bad decisions as Harper?  No, but i understand they were under immense pressure and stress during the holidays with their family and bringing home their loved one (even as just a friend) for the first time. Plus, doesn’t all of these lazy complaints kind of completely defeat the entire purpose of Dan Levy’s amazing speech they gave??? 

Lastly, everyone assuming that Abbie and Riley should have been together really do not understand queer relationships and it’s borderline insulting that any two queer people who are together and have good chemistry must automatically be shipped together. Queer people find embrace, solidarity, and acceptance among each other. Automatically assuming that Riley showing kindness and empathy towards Abbie means that they must get together has a very limited view of how queer people interact with each other. I really enjoyed it a lot. It was sweet and all around well acted and directed.     
My biggest two complaints are that 'evil sister' was a bit too antagonistic for her change in the end to be believable and Harper was a real ass to Abby and I had a really hard time forgiving her.     
That said, Harper basically abandoning Abby in the middle part made me really feel for Abby so I'm not even sure if her being less self absorbed would have improved or weakened the movie as a whole... This was a solid ass christmas movie. Lots of funny moments, a really solid cast, and it managed to be modern for 2020 while still bringing back the vibes of great christmas films from the past.

Aubrey Plaza was great as a serious character here, and Dan Levy stole the show. Dude is fucking funny, and also managed to have the best dramatic scene when he describes what coming out of the closet feels like. I have not seen Schitts Creek, and now I am making it my next binge to get more of this dude.

watch this people Good movie. Dan Levy is hilarious. I loved that when he called Abby, he was in a fish store. I could tell because I have owned fish. It was a fun film with a middling ending. TBH I'm just here for the Tegan and Sara song. I thought it was cheesy and predictable but still really cute and worth watching. Trash. Dan and Abby were the only likeable thing in this. The movie was really enjoyable.

Harper and her family suuuuuuck, except for Jane who was precious and i want to hug

Dan Levy was a surprise joy for me in this, especially his coming out story really got me

I hope we get a sequel or a spin off with more of Aubrey plaza’s character Gave it a 7 overall.  After about 30 minutes I was close to turning it off, but thankfully did not.  Wasn't really a fan of the comedy scenes, didn't really laugh at them.  What saved the movie for me were the more serious scenes, like Riley telling Abby about her past relationship with Harper, or Dan Levy's character talking to Abby about coming out.  I'm  not gay, but that scene made me cry a bit.   I wanted Abby to end up with Riley, but can see why they had her end up with Harper in the end, but if Abby hadn't taken her back, etc... I might have given it a higher rating, since people wouldn't have expected that ending.

Overall, enjoyed, could have been VERY good though. I really really did not like that first half I thought ""wow! I don't care at all"" because it's the same ""hide from family, but have to balance if you're ashamed of showing to family??"" and I don't think anyone... was likable. Daniel Levy's character was clearly just written to fit as David from Schitt's Creek so eh, didn't work for me, didn't seem genuine.

Second half was a little better. I liked the commentary it made in standing up for family and fhat coming out can be as normalized as marriage problems. I found myself not wanting to turn it off because I at least wanted to see what happened.

Overall, just a little better than mediocre, I guess? Solid romcom. I just feel like the title really misses the mark. It does nothing to tell you what the movie is about and sounds like a bland Hallmark channel movie. Luckily some great performances elevated it out of Hallmark territory. Dan Levi steals a lot of scenes It's a hallmark movie with better acting lol. Mackenzie Davis is a very good actress. What a cute Christmas movie! I want more LGBTQ films that aren’t surrounding trauma or cheating on your significant other to figure out you’re gay or over sexualizing lesbian characters. Just a good solid romantic comedy, seems like too much to ask now a days. It’s actually good. I'm just here for Jinkx and Dela. Enjoyed the movie overall, felt that the family with the exception of Jane were too unlikable to be able to be rescued and redeemed in the last 15 minutes. It's a Chrismas movie so I get that they can't have a more compromise ending where maybe the sister and the mother is redeemed but the dad still hasn't come around. There’s a lot to like about this movie but Harper is not one of them. I can’t imagine a straight rom com where the lead would end up with someone so shitty. Really really weird plot development. Aubrey plaza Kristen Stewart is really bad at acting and emoting and delivering lines I'm watching this now. Please someone tells me that Kristen dumps her GF. She's a bitch and hooks up with the ex gf from HS. Im sorry. Not only Haper told her to lied but she basically abandoned abby when she got home and let her fend for herself with her shitty family. [deleted] Folks, a few bad days in a long term relationship with someone you otherwise love enough to move in with and propose to does not a ""toxic"" situation make.

The movie makes the point repeatedly that Harper's behaviour is WAY out of the ordinary and that their relationship is usually great. Not saying the movie couldn't have done more to *show* that, but calling her abusive or toxic is more than a little extra. Kristen Stewart wasn’t the right choice for the role. She was pretty lifeless and didn’t bring much to the character.

Movie was blah. Dan’s scene at the end was the best part of the movie and the fact that Abby still wanted to leave afterwards setting up Harpers apologize at the gas station. 

Pretty mediocre. Jane was great though! John had an offhand comment early in the movie about managing authors, so I think it was implied that he had a role in getting Jane’s book published and so successful. I thought that was a nice little way of completing that arc. Kristen Stewart is great, she should absolutely do more comedies. Her comedic timing was the redeeming feature of the recent-ish Charlie's Angels reboot which was otherwise a dumpster fire. I think Riley's arc got resolved. She got closure with Harper when Harper finally voiced the regret that she'd held onto for so long, and apologised for what she did back in high school. It looked like they took the first step towards letting go of the hurt of their past. 

When they shook hands and Riley squeezed her hand, you could tell how close they used to be. At the end of the movie I had hope that they could regain some of what they'd lost, and maybe become friends again. > I feel like they spent too much screen time showing her being a bad partner to strain their relationship and not enough showing why they were good together in a relationship to begin with.

I really agree with this, I think it left the impression some viewers that Abby and Harper relationships are one-sided and on worst case, toxic. It shouldn't be a surprised that is one of the reason why some people are rooting for Riley and Abby. > Great cast (including smaller cameo parts)  

Jane and the gal cop were played by Mary Holland and Lauren Lapkus, respectively. They are part of the improv/sketch troupe Wild Horses, and they are absolutely hilarious. Here are a couple of skits they've done: [The Heist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oOzAjPxJuk), this [Wonder Woman-themed thing with Conan O'Brien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AByf89Xp0W4), and this killer [podcast where they riff on Sex & the City](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/erin-whitehead-stephanie-allynne-mary-holland-sex-and-the-city/). Yeah, I am so happy to see some other people felt like this. I personally lived through something a lot like what Abby did, with the betrayals and bad treatment, which you can maybe ultimately pin on a closeted person struggling with their repression... and I ALSO forgave the person and gave her another chance... then was married to her for two years that ultimately only served to burn me down the rest of the way to the water line :/

It was such a sweet movie in lots of ways, but I SO was happy to see Abby stick up for herself, and when she finally just admitted she wanted to be with someone who was ready to BE together. And the thought that she might have even wound up with Riley also made me so happy just thinking about it <3 And to have Harper just show up, make a nice speech, and talk her into another go... I found it really traumatized me all over again having such a critical LGBTQ+ movie glorify that kind of thing.

I mean of course it isn't like someone CAN'T turn over a new leaf and just be a decent person on a dime, but I think it's crazy rare, and the idea that it's somehow a reasonable thing to bank on has seriously hurt way more people than just me. I wanna see movies that normalize that you don't HAVE to try to make it work with this same person after that big a heartbreak. There is nothing wrong with both parties trying again with someone who DIDN'T do all this shit to you, or go through this pain that you caused by being shitty (it's often best for both to just cut the cord and start again). Agreed. Harper didn’t treat Abby the way any decent person would treat a roommate, let alone their girlfriend. Even if that cover story was real, Harper was pretty terrible. I wish we could have seen more of what Abby saw in her. Not to mention lying about coming out to your family and inviting your girlfriend to meet them without them knowing you’re gay and together. And only mentioning it when they are trapped in the car together. And then ignoring her request to leave the trip. Agreed.  
  
I was so happy when Harper finally came out and ""picked"" Abby only for Abby to coldly tell her it was too late. I thought the movie was really going to follow up on that -- on how Harper was a bad partner totally separate to her closetedness. I was really hoping at the gas station that Abby would really highlight this but no cigar.  
  
I still like a perfect happy ending where they make up, but this movie really could have gone either way. Abby ending up single or with Riley would have brought more depth at the expense of the feel-good happy ending. Both are equally good, I think. I agree. I kept hating Harper for this. She brought Abby down and then told her what five minutes from the house that she wasn't out to her family. So she shoved her girlfriend back into the closet and then proceeded to treat her worse than someone would treat a general friend. I thought Abby let her off a bit too easily at the end. I linked an interview with the director/writer Clea Duvall. It explains in depth why Harper deserves forgiveness. 

[Clea Duvall interview](https://www.google.com/amp/s/variety.com/2020/film/news/happiest-season-director-clea-duvall-interview-1234843292/amp/) Yeah there were a lot of moments that made Harper seem like a terrible partner/person. 

They really could have resolved them by having not having Harper's friends and family basically ignore Abby and instead have Abby be the one being distant from them. Like at the first party instead of the 2 girls straight up ignoring Abby and her fake a phone call that they didn't even care about, have them be semi interested in her and have her fake the phone call because of being awkward or whatever. Then at the bar have Harper leave with Abby and be resentful that she wasn't hanging out with her high school friends she hasn't seen in a while.

That way while the main issue is still Harper not coming out to her family Abby is still not totally blameless for having a bad time there. It was a big reminder that despite living in much more accepting times,  surrounded by LGBTQ friends who have experienced nothing but support,  it's still a very scary thing to have to go through and not everyone *will* accept it. I'm so glad Dan emphasizes that coming out is still a MASSIVE thing for a person, even if their parents/family are supportive. In Schitt's Creek there's an episode where his boyfriend hadn't told his parents yet after a long time and I thought it was going to go into the territory of ""why would you keep me a secret??"" But even his absolutely selfish, flamboyant character was very sensitive to the situation and knew that it's a huge moment for a person Took the movie up a notch or two in my books. It was a really fun, but potentially disposable to that point, but that scene gave the movie the heart and emotional impact that it really didnt have yet. I can see this movie becoming a bit of a Christmas classic now Still didn't justify her getting back with her. Even if she did finally come out and profess her love to her in front of her family. That wouldn't erase all the emotional and psychological torture that she had just put me through. 

Plus what she did to Plaza in high school. 

I would have connected with Plaza and get as far away from her family and get as far away from Harper as possible. They were all such insufferable ass holes and the one person and the one sister who actually did have a good heart but was a little awkward was flat out neglected. 

This movie had a lot of good will going for it, and then just ruined it with the false-happy ending. But loved Stewart, Levy, and Plaza. 

Oh, and then the kids finally (randomly) admit to putting the necklace in her purse, and the mother never once apologizes for basically accusing her and judging her as a thief? And the kids don't get punished? BULLSHIT Dude has some range. But one of my favorite part was watching him pretend to be straight. That started the waterworks and then I just cried my way through the rest of the movie. To be fair, I was aided by the help of alcohol and closeted gay angst, but still. He was amazing. I teared up. Mediocre movie still got me in the guts. Best scene in this otherwise lifeless movie. It's good seeing her get to play sane human beings. I feel like April Ludgate kinda got her into typecasting for a stretch. I didn’t really get that vibe from Aubrey. I definitely got it from Alison Brie’s character though. I really expected her or her kids(accidentally) to out them as a couple. As someone who has no parents I was wincing a lot when they brought up the orphan thing- I absolutely got it (‘you’re an orphan so happy to see you’ even in your 30s can be cringe) but I thought they might address it as a plot- it just seemed a bit- nothing? I don’t know. Harper kept saying ‘you are my family’ to Abby, and I thought Abby might say, ‘well what does that mean’ back or something, I don’t know. Overall I really liked this film though I personally can't wait for Black Bear I'm really glad they didn't do that with her.  
  
This movie didn't need a spurned lesbian ex-lover outing people and forcing Abby down to Harper's moral level as a character. I loved her in this. A subdued Aubrey really surprised me and killed it. I thought she was great and would love to see her play some more low key characters Did you not see the minute long intro where they’re happy so we’re supposed to root for them despite all the obvious red flags? Haha

Yeah, tonally this movie is all over the place. What got me was the Harper destroying her sister's painting without any hesitation.  That's just psychopathic. This is my favorite comment in this...there's clearly a cut of this movie where Stewart ends up with Plaza. The ending with the family just suddenly coming together and being good people was pretty clearly a last minute decision that messes with the entire tone of the movie. 

I enjoyed watching this movie simply because I like yelling at stupid characters acting completely unrealistically stupid through an entire movie. There were at least 8 points where a rational woman would've been like ""Nope, screw this"" but Kristen Stewart stayed every time lol. I want Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza to star in a movie next Christmas in which Plaza is a fancy doctor living in the big city who hates Christmas and has to go back to her small town where she runs into Kristen Stewart who is a baker who teaches plaza about the joys of Christmas. I want no painful coming out, I want no judgy families. Just a good, shitty, cheesy Christmas rom com. But gay Exactly.  The movie should have invested more in their relationship.  I always wondered why Harper just couldn't tell her girlfriend early on in the relationship that she's not out to her family and that whole situation.  Someone enlighten me but if you're dating...how hard is it to give that heads up... Just finished watching and completely agree. Was so disappointed at the end. I laughed at that part because it is kinda realistic. There's someone on your family who played the ""Tech Support"" part. ""I don't have any secrets but I'm an ally"" Mary gave herself a lot of the best lines in the movie. she wrote the movie too I like that ending better. I also think we need a more fleshing out of Harper and Riley’s past and she deserved a much better apology than the one she got Davis is 5'11, but ""feels"" taller somehow. She has a naked fight scene in Terminator and just dominates the whole screen, it's really cool.

I think they play up KS's relative shortness though because she's meant to feel a little small and out of place next to the family, while Harper is the superficially confident assertive one. For sure. I really feel for Harper's situation, I get just not being able to come out to your family. But the way the movie tried to almost frame Harper basically flirting with Connor as an equivalent to Abby spending time with Riley felt way off base, the two aren't comparable at all ESPECIALLY after Abby already told her at the dinner that it made her uncomfortable. 

I felt bad for Harper right until she got outed, and then tried to bury it again. You know your girlfriend wants you to come out, you've had her basically pretending to be a charity case for this family, you know she hates Christmas **because of her parents' deaths**, and when push came to shove (literally) you rebuke her. Nah, you don't get to make up for that with an apology. 

Also the turn around time on the parents just felt super forced ""have to have a happy ending for this holiday movie"". Honestly, the best case scenario is that when he got that phonecall saying that as long as Harper basically hid her gayness he could win the election is that he would think that's perfectly reasonable and then get irrationally upset when Harper / Abby tell him that's unfair, and accuse them of being selfish. The Connor angle was terrible.  It really seemed like she was rekindling some feelings there. It could have had an incredible ending like The Family Stone where they break up and she could start dating Riley. And then it shows next year at the party and everyone was doing their own thing but well meshed  and it would have been good.

That ending was just so awful. I know it's suppose to be a wholesome Christmas movie so it had to go with a happy ending for Abby and Harper but literally 20 minutes in I stopped rooting for them and wanted Abby to dump Harper. Yeah I get that it's a Christmas movie but the whole time I was hoping they'd really go for it and keep them apart, would have been crazy honestly. Yep. People like Harper and Harper’s parents don’t suddenly have “come to Jesus” moments and then it’s all kumbaya and singing around the fire. 

It left a really bad taste in my mouth how awful they were and then they say “oh sorry” and it’s all good and fine. 

No. That’s not how ANY of that works. This. In what world is this ever going to be a healthy relationship? 

Imagine Harper is a dude. He lies to his family about his girlfriend. He lies to his girlfriend about his family (and whether they know about her). He ignores her at multiple family parties, spends two or three evenings chatting with his ex, and even goes out drinking with the ex. Then he stands by as his family accuses his girlfriend of stealing and shuns her from future events. No way is this going to end with them as a happy couple.

I get it -- coming out to conservative families is hard. But you can't lie about to your partner for months and only tell her after she's in the car, on the way to Christmas with the fam. That's a big breach of consent, which is super important in the LGBT community (and should be for everyone). I was really hoping the film would end with the Krampus coming for all of them except Riley, John, Abby, Jane and the boring-hot boyfriend. fuck her parents why would she want them in her life Couldn’t agree more. I’m supposed to feel sorry for these shitty parents who ruined their children? Oh boohoo, we just wanted to be perfect.... Give me a break!

And Harper was awfully manipulative and shitty to Abby even when the parents’ eyes weren’t on them. She could have had a good fun night with Abby but she treated her like garbage and then played the victim card. Oh and then begged her to stay together. Bad taste in my mouth for sure 🤢 Nope, she seemed so much more honest and down to earth than MacKenzie Davis's character. It's also refreshing to see Aubrey take a break from playing sociopaths and play an regular human being. I was shipping them as well just because their chemistry was more convincing than Abby/Harper but it would have made the most sense for Abby's character to have wound up alone. The movie did *a lot* of heavy lifting in the last 20 minutes to redeem the family's awfulness, and I'm not quite sure it stuck the landing, but I'll go along with it because it's a Christmas movie.

Jane is hands down the MVP. honestly, they had much better chemistry - part of it was just the actresses but part of it was plot-related, as Riley was the only one in Harper's entire extended circle that actually paid any attention to Abby and listened to her. I was waiting for Aubrey to make a move, and the closest she got was changing seats in the booth to sit next to Kristen and I'm glad she didn't. Would have just been a tacky move for what turned out to be such a good character/person. Abby was planning on proposing to Harper and then two days later gets together with her ex instead? I don't think that would have made much sense. I do think they might have made Harper a bit too unlikable though. She was clearly not acting like herself due to the pressure of having to hide her true self from her parents, but she was also just kind of an asshole (idk if you can blame ditching your girlfriend to hang out with your ex on being in the closet). I could see Abby ending up alone, but I think they still wanted this to be a feel-good family holiday movie. If you keep an eye out during the credits then it looks like Aubrey Plaza's character lands Clea Duvall, so I think she'll be fine They're both very natural, realistic, charismatic actors in a movie where everyone around them is acting like a cartoon, it's a bit jarring at times. Aubrey Plazas character definitely deserved more of a pay off, she got shat on pretty bad. No, you're right, that's how it should have ended instead. 100%. They could have been really ambitious with this, but they went with the safe route, which I understand. But at the same time, Abby went through so much shit and a couple apologies won’t cut it. No, there are a bunch of people (me included) who felt the exact same way. I loved it honestly all the way up until the end. Yes, definitely wanted them to end up together instead. Ugh I came for spoiler just to see of they do. I do not like her gf at all. I thought that was going to happen. Harper was a total self centered bitch. You and the rest of the internet! Woah I just realized Lady Gaga has a song called Mary Jane Holland... Mary Holland playing a Jane? Odd coincidence > Also, because Dan Levy. But who doesn't like Dan Levy?  
  
He's an utter treasure I wish they’d given a little more exposition on their relationship being really solid and worth getting back! I felt like there was 3 minutes of happiness before the I’ve been lying to you for 6 months revelation and had a bit of whiplash I agree with most of your points. 

There are a few things I didn't like about Harper's behaviour (spending all night with an ex without a good explanation and when they're still into you is a big no no), but they got it right when they mentioned that her behaviour was 99% about her and her relationship with her parents. It affects Abby, for sure, but it wasn't about her. I'm not excusing her behaviour, but it's not necessarily a reason to run away.

This is what a complex relationship looks like. There are a lot of moving parts, they're figuring it out, and are growing together. I'm surprised they showed this in a whitish family (a lot of gay and straight people I've been around have been judgemental about grown women who haven't come out to their parents yet) to be honest. But I think it's important to see the different kinds of people out there. of all characters in that movie, I felt reflected in Jane. I suspect that she fulfilled the autistic (particularly Asperger's syndrome) character role, and I thought the filmmakers presented autism with justice and respect. There's a lot of people who don't know that they're on the spectrum and will find Jane's character to resonate with them.

This film was great at capturing such a wide berth of today's culture in a hilarious but still respectful manner. I appreciate films like this where views from different sides are treated with equal respect and satire. Mary Holland is on a ton of podcasts if you're into the sort of thing yeah the ending was a bit over the top for me. Not the main couple getting back together, thats expected for the genre, but the family getting past all their biases and feuds in like 2 days was too much for me. The parents ended up having no hangups at all (at least not on camera) about their daughter's sexuality, and then the sisters make up 100% and are buddy buddy all of a sudden? They were at eachothers throats all movie and Allison Brie crossed some major lines. 

It felt too much like the mega happy ending from Waynes World ehhh there are a lot of romcoms that end on that note but like you said they more than likely didnt because of christmas This movie was ""Get Out"" for the gays. I don't think I could've handled Kristen Stewart and Mary Elizabeth Winstead playing a lesbian couple. Or Stewart and Plaza. Mackenzie Davis really looked like Mary Elizabeth Winstead in this film. I kept thinking it was her, honestly. 100% of the film. She got away with so much abuse and gaslighting.

Also, she's a narcissist, sadly, which is what happens to a lot of children of narcissists cuz trauma. And they don't change overnight. Actually, they don't change ever. It's a personality disorder and a big part of it is refusing to admit fault. Horrible ending So true. It was painful to watch. It just pissed me off how Abby gets treated the whole movie, but then all is magically forgiven and wow Harper really is a keeper isn’t she? 🙄 Aubrey Plaza was a good support character, too. Mackenzie Davies was really flat, but also wasn't given any character outside of 'closeted' In the Instagram photos during the credits, there’s one pic (I think when they were at Pride?) where you can see Riley and she’s with another woman - it’s actually a cameo by Clea DuVall who wrote & directed the movie! Harper was extremely toxic and manipulative. It feels like the ending was completely changed to fit something happy. This movie didn’t know what wanted to be and the two worst actors were the leads. I think you make good points, but as viewers the movie absolutely needed to show us more of them in a healthy relationship before showing us the toxic shit Harper started doing.  We need to know what they’re usual flow is so we can root for them to get back together. 

They failed us by making Riley more likable in every way and showing us nothing but a toxic Harper. > I guess equality in its ultimate form is letting gays have the same generic slop the straights have had for decades

lmao that was my favorite scene i started crying with them Holy crap lesbian Get Out is the perfect description. Except get out was actually entertaining. I couldn’t even finish the movie and even skipped through the half that I saw to the Aubrey plaza parts lol. I wanted to like it because I like some of the actors but nah. >She said she would try to get Abby to love Christmas, then she does nothing at all to make Christmas special.

I think the idea was that when Harper spontaneously invited Abby to visit her family over Christmas, she was happy and confident and in love, in a place where she felt comfortable and could be herself, and just said what she was feeling. She really wanted to do those things, and she momentarily forgot that her situation was different at home.

By the next day, reality had set in and she tried to dissuade Abby from coming, because I think she realised that her optimistic vision of getting Abby to love Christmas again with her family was not how it was going to go. It stopped being about what she wanted (to enjoy Christmas with her girlfriend), and just became a matter of surviving the situation. Then once they got there, she unconsciously regressed into unhealthy behaviours that she learned during childhood, repressing her true feelings at every turn, and lashing out when the guilt became too much. She overcompensated and distanced herself completely.

If she were thinking more rationally I think she could have found a way to keep her secret without being so neglectful, and they could have at least enjoyed Christmas events together as ""friends"", but she was making some very poor decisions due to fear. Exactly how I envisioned a better version too I really enjoyed reading this.

That's a great point: Sometimes, saying ""no"" is more about yourself than whomever is being told ""no."" If that person is someone you love, it's incredibly painful (another example would be the movie trope where a character must leave the love of his life because he doesn't want to endanger her life). I've never cried so hard and for so long in any movie, and it's largely because there's so much in this movie that resonated with me and I could relate to.

Yeah, both Harper and Abby had good reasons behind their choices. It's just unfortunate that the choices weren't compatible. That's how life is and maturity can be measured by how one deals with challenge—loss and  misfortunes included—and thereby how one adapts; do you face and accept reality or do you deny and evade it? This is grit applied to relationships.

I actually enjoyed the happy ending. I probably would also enjoy the tragic ending.

After this movie, I have a total crush on Kristen Stewart too. 🥰 Her outfits were also on point. 😆😍 Perfect ending would've been Abby and Harper taking a break to let Harper actually think about her actions then coming back together later on ***or*** them just not getting back together at all: a fast forward to next Christmas with John meeting up with Abby and Riley, Harper spending time with her family who have mended things between themselves and came to terms. City council jobs are typically not a full time job. I assume Ted had a high-paying executive job or something akin to that prior to running for Mayor. Their sister was pretty nice Right? I was in pain the whole movie because of the mistreatment and abuse on Abby. But then I thought “oh, if she realizes she deserves better than that and sticks up for herself then that could be very satisfying!”

Nope, just go back to the awful partner just cuz she begged and things didn’t go her way. Just awful. Not cute, not heartwarming. Just... god Im actually saddened by the ending because it seemed like they were setting it up to be a movie about cutting out abusers. Like Harper is dealing with trauma but so is every abuser. People shouldn't be taught to just deal with it -- especially queer people!! It's pretty sick ending actually. :+( Agreed, Harper's bad traits alone could fill a novel yet she's meant to be seen as the protagonist. Let's see - 

She lied to Abby about her home life & didn't tell her until they were halfway through a long car ride & Abby literally could not escape. She blindsided her into that house & gave her like 30 minutes to prepare to live a lie, then cracked jokes at her expense for being a bad liar. Like..bitch. 

Harper let her family accuse Abby of being a thief & didn't lift a finger to correct them. That ""well if my brooch does show up on my dresser there'll be no questions asked"" line boiled my piss & I would have lost it. 

Harper clearly hurt people in her past, she threw Riley to the wolves & let an entire high school believe she was an unwelcome stalker rather than tell the truth. Fucking. Yikes. It's implied she hurt the ex boyfriend & left him without closure too, as he seems pretty hurt when he goes to her & asks her to explain what happened to him. She probably hurt more people that we don't even know about. 

Harper, after literally trapping her girlfriend in an abusive household, abandoned her & threw her under the bus. Just left her to fend for herself in a confusing new environment where the shining twins are doing their best to give her a criminal record & the parents of the house literally won't look her in the eye. Went & hung around with everyone except abby. 

Then after soft-ghosting her in this terrible situation Abby reaches out to her for help for the first time, she says 'you're suffocating me.' Like damn Abby didn't even consent to being there, you literally tricked & trapped her there under false pretences & you then have the audacity to call her suffocating? No. Just no. 

When Harper finds out that her sister was going through a divorce, literally the first thing she did was say ""yeeessss, I can use this to blackmail you!"" Not 'oh god that's awful' or 'I'm sorry' but ""I'm going to use this against you."" I know that Sloane was a bitch but come on girl that's your sister

Harper would prefer to literally fistfight her own sister in front of Abby than she would to come out. That fight scene was so heartbreaking. Imagine it from Abby's perspective, she's looking at the woman she loves rolling around on the floor beating her sister with various household objects because she doesn't want to admit she's with her. Yikes man. Yikes. Is that going to come up in the wedding speech? ""Haha honey remember that time I garrotted my sister with tinsel because I didn't want anyone to know I was with you? Ah, memories.""

The painting. I went back & rewatched the ending scene & when Harper slams that painting that the pure sweet innocent sister spent a hundred hours earnestly making over Sloane's head, she wasn't even provoked. There was a minute or two of silence & stillness then Harper just goes from 0-100 cavewoman  & whams it over Sloane's head for no other reason than..she's a bitch. Again, imagine physically seeing the woman you love do that in front of you do that rather than admit she's with you. 

& at the end of all this? It was all 100% completely fucking unnecessary. Harper lives in a state where she can face no bad consequences for coming out. She did all this not because she had to, but because she was a coward. It's 2020 in pittsburgh. Not Russia. Girl you can come out you idiot there is literally nothing stopping you

& when she is forced out of the closet? Absolutely nothing happens. She's cuddling on the sofa with her girlfriend five minutes later, accepted by everyone. They get engaged because that's been legal there for ages. Like...what the fuck girl you just emotionally traumatised about 4 people for Absolutely. No. Reason. 

So after spending an hour thirty minutes gaslighting, manipulating, lying, mentally/emotionally abusing, blindsiding, railroading, abandoning, blackmailing, literally beating up, dismissing, extorting, & generally fucking with people..Harper gets a happy ending. 

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

I don't even think Harper's constant assertions that she was going to come out 'after Christmas' were true. I think she would have found a way to weasel out of it. She's such a casual liar, dropping big lies & little lies with every breath, there's no reason to believe she was actually going to do the right thing. 

& even if she did, how is it acceptable to place more value on not 'spoiling' the parents precious Christmas than on your apparent partner's right to live openly as their true identity? To Harper, Xmas was more important than her girlfriend's identity. Literally. Priorities? 

Gay people have spent thousands of years having our identities stomped into the dust, we don't really want to see a movie where for 1 hour 30 mins Xmas cheer > our existence. 

Okay I think I'm done now I haven’t finished trying to ignore this movie while my partner watches, and I’m bummed that Abby doesn’t leave Harper for Riley! THANK YOU for the last part. I have toxic parents who are pretty similar to Harper's, and I dreamed for most of my life that they would have a moment where they realized how terrible they were. I'm 46, and it's taken years of therapy to understand that's never going to happen. To see it happen in this movie was absolutely ridiculous, especially when so much of the movie was spent showing how deeply embedded the fucked up family dynamics were. I can see having her painting thoughtlessly destroyed being the tipping point for Jane. Of course the movie then has her easily forgive her family like the rest. It seems like the writers took it in one direction the whole movie, and then the ending got changed or something..

The scene where Harper is, in classic narcissist fashion, saying ""I did it!"" And expecting Abby to take her back, and Abby says no. I was like ""yes!"" -- it was so triumphant and I was so excited to get a movie that says NO to abusers, with a main character who has supportive friends who come to help remove them from abuse with no questions asked.

Then the ending is completely off the rails. I legit think that those pigs in hollywood said, ""this movie is too radical"" and changed the ending because it has nothing to do with what they set up. And you're exactly right that queer kids will see this and think they should also rush into abusive relationships and recreate patriarchal oppressions and all that shit. And I think that was the point of the ending. To recreate a culture of abuse I was a little annoyed when Abby took Harper back after begging in a gas station parking lot for 30 seconds. Like clearly Harper needed some more time to grow. 

It seemed like Harper’s entire personality changed from one 5 day vacation. I would be worried what the next situation would be in which my girlfriend would treat me like such shit. It was so natural for her, it might only be a matter of time. I think she's just making a joke because previously at the party Aubrey Plaza's character mentions how everyone wants to tell her about and have her diagnose their ailments. Kristen's character is making up a fictional ailment to ask her about since Aubrey's character is in medical school. It's just an ice breaker in reference to their previous conversation at the party when Aubrey complained everyone was asking her to diagnose random illnesses. Mood I've never cried so hard and for so long in any movie. I was completely bawling. 🥺🥺🥺 It felt like it needed an extra 15 minutes to convince me that Harper deserved forgiveness after that final denial, which was fucking awful. I dunno how to do that, plot wise. Maybe like they spend a few weeks apart and then Abby sees Harper talk about her sexuality on the campaign trail for her dad and talk about how she loves her. I guess then it wouldn’t be a ~Christmas movie~ but..... the happy ending didn’t feel earned, it felt rushed! As someone on the spectrum I think she did have a few ASD traits. The fixation on her worldbuilding & being unable to tell when the person she's talking to about it being uncomfortable is one. Her social awkwardness & prowess with technology being another. The occasional inappropriate action or sentence. The fact that she was mentioned as biting people in her childhood, which can be another trait. 

The parents mentioned 'giving up on her' which when you think about how -old- & ignorant they were, is absolutely in keeping with the fact that Jane is probably an autistic female who went undiagnosed into adulthood - it happens a lot with women. They are far more often passed off as 'quirky' rather than being given the tests that they need by their parents. Given how shitty the parents were overall, I can absolutely see Jane not being given the evaluation she needs & her parents not having the faintest clue what ASD is. 

She's still my favourite character, after Riley. She was the most sympathetic character in the whole film. No she's just the only freaking normal person in that family. Anyone would look autistic next to those neat freaks haha. I would say that it's very, very likely. >Her character and her performance is the heart and soul of the film.

Jane, too. [deleted] Yes! That's the thing for me too. I have no problem with Harper being closeted, as Levy's speech says so beautifully that is a different journey for every person and not an any way a character flaw. Like you said, the problem is Harper's only other character traits were terrible. She lies to and manipulates Abby throughout and even if Abby had just been her roommate Harper still treated her terribly. > I were Abby and my partner told me the second before we left that she had lied about coming out and I needed to hang out in the closet to protect that lie I would have simply not gone on the trip 

Crazy thing is she doesn't even do that much. She waits until they're already in the car and half way there before she tells her that. I started to dislike Harper at that point and it only got worse from there. Trespassing on a neighbor's roof is also a terrible way to get the audience to like your main characters. For me, it was when Abby was saying how she really just enjoys taking care of animals around Christmas and Harper interrupts her to drag her on a roof. Also I don't think Harper would have come out had Sloane not outed her. It wasn't even ""she was too late,"" it was ""she waited until she didn't have a choice."" Yeah I don't see them together as a happy ending at all Or at least had Harper have to work for it more. It's like Abby instantly forgave her after a final apology at the gas station. I thought it would have been more cute if Abby had still been saying no and then maybe Harper do the big thing of proposing. Little too Hallmark movie, but the whole thing read a bit like one anyways. They could have even went as far as Abby and Harper returning and Tipper giving Harper a family ring for Abby as a symbol of acceptance. I just about bought it, because throughout the movie it seemed like the parents' toxic behaviour was based in obliviousness and being slaves to conformity, rather than genuine bigotry. I think they just didn't have a clue how shitty they were. A lot of people don’t really consider these things until it affects them directly, like their kids being gay/lesbian. Yeah, it seemed very rushed in service of a happy ending, even with the two minute mystery about the dad being accepting or not. I told my parents I was trans about 4 years ago and I've been on HRT for almost as long; they still won't acknowledge it at all and while I'm out to my friends, it's really hard to fully come out when you still love your parents and want a somewhat-functional relationship with them and your family.

Think the film might have been better served by having the same epilogue with them being supportive, but not showing them immediately being perfect in days. Trying to be nice, maybe.  

Happiest Season gave me a lot of complicated feelings in general, since I pretend to be a completely normal dude in a fair bit of my life, and that naturally extends to asking my girlfriend to 'play along' in family situations. I still prefer the Riley/Abby idea, but I can empathise with Harper a lot (barring the times where she's going above and beyond being scared to come out by being uncaring/nasty towards Abby). I think, with the best of intentions, DuVall was maybe a little too kind to conservatives. She was trying too hard to resist depicting them as cruel as they usually seem to be in this context, because she didn't want anybody to be the villain, but the upshot is that people with a little less first person perspective on these kinds of scenarios might not pick up on the cues about what Harper is so scared of. I can't say for sure but I know he has his own line of glasses so could be those? I think it's a movie about accepting and loving your abusers. It's super sad actually I don’t think her backstory was needlessly tragic, they just mention her parents being dead and they don’t elaborate on the details, the whole joke there for me was her family are the ones beating her over the head with it. I think if they were going full tragedy it would’ve laboured the sad details and also had her parents rejecting her or something. I did and thought that would've been the better ending, still not too bad. And, honestly, they needed to make Harper far more likeable. If we had had more redeemable scenes with her pov or focus, I think it would've flown a bit better. I absolutely despised her character the whole way through. This is pretty much my take as well. I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. It's not perfect from a story structure or writing standpoint, but loved that the representation felt natural and that they got such good actresses for all the roles. Harper could be very unlikeable, but the actress did such a phenomenal job. You could see her code switch with her body language and tone when she was back with her friends. Also, Jane is the hero of the story. Tbf I think that was really what clea Duvall was after, IIRC her quote was something like she just wanted to make a gay Christmas film, and to me that’s what this is. It’s just cutesy and silly and there’s the odd quite touching moment, in its own way I think it’s great for that though. It’s not setting out to be a hard hitting Film About Being LGBT. I'm glad to hear this. I was worried they were going to play to their personas and try to out-bland each other. I really like them both. cast was def 10/10 If you liked the ex husband:

https://youtu.be/Xs-UEqJ85KE Yeah, I pointed out the phone call plot hole too. In the time & location this film was set, the 'villain' could be sued into the ground for suggesting the don't ask don't tell mentality. It just doesn't hold up. 

I got bollocked by a bunch of tumblrites who babbled about how i was living in a privileged bubble because coming out can get you killed in Russia. Uh, this is set in Pittsburgh. You can't make this stuff up. 

I was wondering about the tracker thing too. Just what did the friend put on her phone that allows him to easily know exactly where she is? Is it a chip? Is it software? I'm genuinely curious, & how did Harper get it too? Shouldn't Abby be saying 'um guys how are you all doing this' Lol just because Dave ""All Lives Matter"" Rubin has discovered he can make more money simping for billionaires as a gay man doesn't mean that pretty much all homophobes aren't conservative, if not all. The movie never even specified if the dad was an R, plenty of Dems act all stuffy just like he did. I mean, it probably helps that modern ""centrist"" Dems are just R's from 30 years ago with a couple of social issues sprinkled in, but that's beside the point. Plaza was there to give background into how horrible Harper was and to have chemistry with K Stew. The cynic in me wants to think, ""What could be more iconic than two queer folks remaining in an obviously toxic relationship despite hundreds of red flags? \*sips wine\*""

Then I remind myself that it was made for a primarily heterosexual audience that in all likelihood would have no clue how common this is, and that the movie portrays a wlw relationship just like a heteronormative relationship would be shown in other similar Christmas feel-good movies. Romcoms are by and large not meant to show healthy relationships, because those don't sell as many tickets. It's a problem endemic to the genre, not this movie in particular. Granted, it could have tried to do better, but to paraphrase us both, toxic relationships put butts in seats.

I didn't catch that Jane was ASD-coded, but I'm not too great at picking up things like that. It does make a bit of sense now that you mention it. Still, if it was enough for people to miss, that may allow for some plausible deniability. One could say that some people act differently because they're autistic, and some other people act differently because they're just odd. the sisters were SO abusive. by the end of the movie i despised harper and was disappointed that the couple ended up together. how could you want to be with someone who treats their lovable sister in such a dismissive and cruel way? Thank you for writing this. I'm fuming after watching it and you perfectly expressed why. Thank you for putting this into words. It was an awful movie and it’s a bummer how relatively popular it is- this is NOT the message we want to convey. 

Awful writing, awful characters, disappointing and sad. I did not see Jane as ASD at all, curious to know why you think that? I'm also aspie, btw. I do not think she was created as a tokenized version of aspergers at all It’s disappointing that this type of toxicity is so commonplace that queers think they just have to accept this kind of behavior to find love. Thank you for writing something that so accurately captured what I felt about the movie. 

I’m so frustrated by the lack of adequate representation in movies that we’re supposed to accept the outright toxicity of this movie. Yes yes yes. One of my red flags right away but it seemed to have gone unnoticed, I've been looking for comments so I don't feel like I'm crazy in feeling upset how they wrote Jane's character. i realize I'm biased and probably notice ASD characters more because of personal experience but I noticed it right away and felt offended. Also, isn't the ex-gf non-white? She's one of the main characters (and probably the best delineated one) do you think it would have been less racist feeling if they had an all white cast? I kinda think it would have, it felt forced how they did it Yeah also why wouldn't Mackenzie Davis have just come to her room instead, it being her family home and all? lmao Thank you, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here about how hard people are going in on Harper. We have no reason to believe she's a full time asshole - outside of this trip, she's presented as a pretty awesome girlfriend Abby is head over heels about, and this is just a weird blip.

We have LOTS of ways to understand her family did a major number on her for a long time though, I kinda think people aren't connecting the dots between *her* weird thing and how weird her sisters are too. 

I felt a little like DuVall wanted to be gracious about not presenting Harper’s parents as monsters just because they're conservative, but maybe she needed to be a bit more explicit in how shitty they've really been. I feel like a lot of people are missing the markers dropped here and there about why Harper thinks she has no other options. I totally agree — but then, don’t bring your girlfriend and force her to lie and ignore her! Obviously then there wouldn’t be a movie. But in real life, you don’t need to shove your girlfriend back into the closet and re-traumatize her because you aren’t out to your family yet. For me I didn't mind the closeted arc I just hate how Harper treated Abby the whole time. First she lied about coming out (the first time). Then she asked Abby to come knowing full well that she would have to pretend to be straight. She then ignored Abby to flirt with Conner(?) and said that Abby was suffocating her even though Harper had been ignoring her. It definitely did not help that they had no chemistry at all nor did she have any character traits. Having dated in closeted situations neither my partners nor I ever acted the way Harper did.  I think a lot of this also boils down to subpar writing. If they had taken out the Conner part they'd have more time to flesh out their relationship and Harper's actions would feel a little more understandable. > Another thing I noticed: There is a lot of criticism towards Harper's character (i.e., ditching Abby to hang out with her straight friends), which some sense, and the manner that she prioritized her family over Abby for a good part of the film. I want to share that coming out to family is so complicated—it is not a linear process. I am trying to see Harper's perspective with compassion and patience. I know some queer people who are incredibly close to their family, and they have put their queerness aside to maintain that connection and not lose their family. It's not my place to judge.

Yeah, I am glad that you try to empathize with Harper, and I really appreciate your perspective. I quite agree - I have the pleasure of being so blatantly queer that the closet isn't really a thing, and even I got uncharacteristically choked up at that conversation about coming out. My biggest fear with the direction was the way they would approach the choice to be closeted, but thankfully they actually tackled how intensely toxic it can be to that person and everyone in their radius, and created space where it's an understandable decision Ehh Harper treated her like trash even when the parental pressure wasn't there.. I didnt think that was a happy ending >	I've never seen Dan Levy in anything before and he was easily my favourite character. He's hilarious and his monologue was really moving.

Please do yourself a favour and check out Schitt’s Creek! Even if the family is 100% accepting, you don't blindside someone you care about like that.  If she couldn't have been open with her family than she shouldn't have invited her...period.  I honestly can't understand how anyone can accept the ending of this movie after all the putrid self-centered awful things Harper did. Harper didn't so muck -ask- Abby to go into that situation as she did completely railroaded her into it.  Harper lied to Abby & told her she was out, got Abby halfway through like an eight hour car ride where Abby had no chance to turn back or escape, -then- hit her with the surprise. Harper both tricked & forced Abby into a situation she did not consent to & it was skeevy as hell. Made me really mad. Abby literally could not escape (1000 dollar uber ride) & was essentially imprisoned in an abusive house until her friend came to rescue her. 

I also agree with the 2020 thing. I could understand the desperation to stay in the closet if it was the 80s, 90s, 00s, but 2020? No. It felt anachronistic. Harper lives in a place/time where she would face no consequences for coming out but she acted like she was living in Russia next door to a Gulag or something. That evil lady's speech at the end wouldn't even hold up because in that state you could be sued into the ground for discriminating against homosexuality. 

Then when she was forced out of the closet, what happened to her? Absolutely nothing. Five minutes later she was cuddling with her girlfriend on the sofa  & the world continued to turn. Harper put multiple people through emotional trauma for years (Riley, the boyfriend, abby & who knows who else) for -absolutely no reason- other than her own cowardice. 

TL;DR I don't like Harper If you haven't seen Black Mirror's San Junipero I can't recommend it enough. Mackenzie Davis is also in it. It's a self contained hour long story, so treat it as a movie. Imagine Me and You is a good one This isn't really a kids movie or Santa movie. I don’t see why kids that still believe in Santa would want to watch this I think the only two parts are when the grandma tells the mom to make sure to take the kids to see Santa bc ""this may be the last year they get to see Santa"" and then later after they see Santa the mom asks Kristen to watch the kids (who are right there) bc they just asked him for a new gift and does a winking motion There is a scene where the topic of believing in Santa too long comes up. There's two scenes referring to santa not being real.  One outright states ""when I stopped believing in Santa"", one kind of alludes without directly saying it.

Regardless, I don't think this movie would appeal to anyone who's not at least a teenager yet. Just watched.. Can't agree more. Bad acting, rewarding toxicity, just bad. Aside from Harper being physically attracted to Abbie, I know nothing about their relationship dynamic. The first real thing we get from their relationship is Harper kicking herself for inviting Abbie to Christmas and trying to gaslight her into not going. 


Almost the entire movie was spent showing Harper neglecting Abbie and treating her like trash, even if it was out of fear of being rejected by her family, that’s not how you treat the person you love. I didn’t think Harper was on the same page as Abbie so it just didn’t seem like a good fit. Also, aside from the chemistry between Aubrey Plaza and Kristen Stewart, Riley was shown being there for Abbie and being supportive to her so it definitely seemed like there was something there. 


A toxic relationship riddled with red flags is bad, gay or straight and I’m saying that as a bisexual in a queer relationship. I’m queer and I still think Harper acted horribly. I understand how difficult and scary it is to come out, and Dan Levy’s character explained it so beautifully.

But it wasn’t just about her not coming out. If that had been the only big thing it would have been forgivable. It was the fact that Harper spent the *entire* movie being inconsiderate of her girlfriend’s feelings. She lied in the first place about having already come out to her parents, and then didn’t tell Abby until they were on the way there? And instead of ever making time for Abby, she abandons her at every social gathering and then gets jealous when she becomes friends with Riley. When she decided to spend a whole night with her ex and then lashed out at Abby for smothering her I lost it. I wish they’d shown more of Harper’s perspective and her fear of coming out but instead I just watched her treat her partner like shit for over an hour and it became impossible to sympathize. If they sprinkled in some redeemable moments throughout I would’ve felt better about the ending. I've been thinking about this. There are some elements I feel like people are confused about because the movie glazed over them, and I'm wondering if Clea just took it for granted that the main audience would ""get"" it without her having to work through it on screen. The little jabs from the mom about what a shame it is for Riley etc, Harper comes from a real shitshow family and the person she reverts to around them is the person she had to be to grow up with them. All of that feels pretty real and recognisable to me, I don't have to see Victor Garber fundraising with Westboro Baptist to get it.

I just don't find her behaviour as baffling as a lot of others. Not that I think it's good or fine or excusable, but I didn't find it puzzling and the complete write off she's getting under the circumstances is just ??? to me. >everyone assuming that Abbie and Riley should have been together really do not understand queer relationships and it’s borderline insulting that any two queer people who are together and have good chemistry must automatically be shipped together

Straight people are also nice to each other even when they don't want sex, so it's equally true that two straight people being nice to each other doesn't automatically mean sparks are flying; but it's obviously a common thing for people to ship people together who seem like they'd make a good couple even if they're not one and there's no reason to think they'd make a good couple other than that they're cute together/people want to see the drama that would ensure. I think rather than people not understanding queer relationships, you just don't understand ship culture. Had this same experience watching the movie. My parents accepted me, but coming out was so hard and I truly didn't know if they would. Harper's situation hit home for me, and I thought it was very realistic, if not slightly hyperbolic for the fact that it's a freaking movie. People are so quick to get their torches on the internet. If this was a straight relationship and all of that came about, no one would be defending this couple. There would be more articles talking about how Happiest Season endorses abusive relationships in a post-Me Too world. Definitely watch Schitts Creek. Dan Levy and Co. have been pumping out great comedy for years. Also, the show has some dramatic beats that really work. And Aubrey I kept thinking similar. It had all the plot points I'd expect out of a Hallmark movie. Nah, you just don’t speak Lesbian. I was saying the same thing the whole time. She’s so shitty. Admitting attraction and being a Lesbian are two different things. One is usually seen as a quirk and innocent, the other is a sin, confusion, or a mental disorder. Being in the closet is usually centered around fear and as progressive as we like to think the world is, it's far from being a safe place for those who go against the grain.

I myself have never come out to a family member and never will. My traditional caribbean family isn't the one to test the waters with and I know my safety and well-being being will definitely be in jeopardy if I did. I know far too many Jamaicans and Trinis who made the mistake of coming out and have had it used against them (a friend couldn't go to school after dad refused to pay tuition one semester because she cut her hair and looked ""like a dyke"" so she had to get box braids until it grew out and isn't aloud to wear pants anymore.)

I know like more than a handful of guys and girls, who have been kicked out and completely disowned without a penny in their name.

Covid took my job and both of my roommates so I had to move all the way back home while trying to get on my feet and I for sure have taken steps to ensure no one would dare to question me being straight because I'm not in a place where I could pick myself up if they were to toss me out on my ass.

Sometimes, coming out is far more worse than being in the closet. Lesbians still deal with plenty of stigma, it just looks a little different than it does for men. People tend to be chill with women being attracted to other women, if it’s seen as a fun cute sexy thing, but that doesn’t mean they’re accepting of actual lesbian relationships once they’re explicitly refusing to cater to men in any way.

Either way Harper’s an asshole It mostly depends on which country/area you're in. In many parts of the world it's dangerous & a potential death sentence to come out, but this film was not in one of them. Harper was just being a selfish manipulative ass. ""The movie makes the point repeatedly that Harper's behaviour is WAY out of the ordinary""

They literally tell us that she did this to another girl in high school lol That makes more sense. I was a bit confused on why and how he ended up being included not only with the book but in Harper’s family in general besides being Abby’s best friend Oh that's so funny, I noted that early line as clunky exposition but failed to connect it to Jane's ending I really do think the Twilight series were the worst movies she has made. Same with Robert Pattinson. > At the end of the movie I had hope that they could regain some of what they'd lost, and maybe become friends again.

I think in the end Riley became friends again with Harper, I think it is implied from [this photo](https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Happiest-Season-Photo-by-Lacey-Terrell-1.jpg\)) that Tipper posted on her Instagram, you can see it during the credit. Yes exactly, this. Maybe even just a conversation at the start showing that Harper understood why coming home for Christmas was such a big deal for Abbie Yes! And the guy mall cop was played by Timothy Simons, whose character in Veep married Mary Holland’s character. Mary Holland also co-wrote the movie and Jane was definitely the role she wrote for herself even though she could have played anyone else in the film. Totally agree, glad you said this. I was hoping she would be with Riley after that. The speech from Harper was all talk no action. I thought it would be a great message if she left Harper and stood her ground. Having her go back to her anyway just seemed weak to me. It reminded me of all the times Ive had girl friends that go back to their toxic exes and get hurt all over again. Yup, 100% agree. I was hoping Riley and Abby would be together at the end of the movie because of how selfish and terrible Harper was, she never redeemed herself imo. I liked the movie but I just feel sad for Abby. Maybe I’m more shallow than Abby, but honestly, asking what someone sees in *Mackenzie Davis*?

I agree though, it would have been nice to see at least one scene in the movie where Harper actually acts as a positive, supportive partner. There’s the intro sequence with the paintings, but it’s not quite enough. Maybe a director’s cut? Dan Levy handles queerness excellently. His wine metaphor was phenomenal in Schitt's Creek. Oh my god when Patrick’s parents are like “where did we go wrong?” And David’s like “I’m sorry?” And they says “where did we go wrong that he felt he needed to hide?” And David wipes away a tear and is like “oh I thought that was gonna go a different way”?!That shit destroyed me 

Dan is a national treasure This comment right here. Pretty sure they didn't need to add a 5 minute scene just to show some kids getting yelled at. I disagree, I really think he doesn’t have range and that I felt like I was watching David Rose in a movie. And I have a strong feeling that’s what we’ll always get with Dan Levy

BUT

I really don’t want to dismiss him as a writer and a personality going forward in Hollywood. I think he can do a lot of amazing things and I love his work. I just don’t see him as an amazing actor. This was the highlight of the movie for me. I rewound a few times just for this scene. Captain Holt level pretending to be gay. Yeah after Plaza’s character got a few scenes I knew she was cool. But when she was first introduced I expected them to make her play the part of “crazy ex-girlfriend”. That intro also included Harper letting Abby fall off a roof because SHE thought it would be fun to go up there lol The quick rehabilitation of the parents was the worst. They were absolute monsters who should have been shunned by the sisters at the end. Queer people find solace, solidarity, and acceptance among other queer people. Showing kindness and empathy does nothing equate to “leave the partner you love and have a life together with who you were also planning just 2 days ago to propose to because someone else was nice to you when you were in the middle of a fight with your partner” 

I find it irritating that people think any two queer people who have good chemistry together must automatically be paired together. It’s so limiting, small minded, and puts all queer people in a box. Queer people have vastly different relationships among each other and it’s clear many people in this thread don’t have queer relationships. I didn’t find anything inherently sexual between between Abbie and Riley because they to me looked like two queer woman who finding comfort among each other’s company during a difficult time of the year for many and finding a friendly shoulder to lean on. That is what sparks amazing friendships. Not every queer person needs to be romantically linked because they were nice to each other And pretends it's okay. No problem. I do this all the time. It's nothing. You know I'm something of an engineer myself. Always! That family did not deserve that girl hey I know you Agreed! Honestly I cried quite a bit at the end watching all Abby was going through. When I came out to my family, I’m Bi, they were all like okay cool. But my cousin, his parents are so unsupportive (and they don’t even know for sure they just heard rumors ) and I’ve watched him struggle so hard to try to come out. It breaks my heart.

So I get Harper’s fear, I’ve seen it in real life. But she still really messed up with a lot of their actions and she was forgiven way too easy. They needed to actually work it out. Every film I’ve seen her in she looks *giant* even though I have a few 5’10 girl friends and it’s no big deal. Agreed. I empathized with Harper for Harper’s situation, so I was never on the whole “leave her for Riley” camp that a lot of people seemed to be on. Totally agree that the ending was wrapped up too cleanly - it seemed that it suddenly shifted from their family being homophobic to her family all being under pressure from each other (which I guess makes sense but is a bit convenient to wrap it all up). 

I also wish the movie hadn’t also framed her friends as being homophobic too. They had Harper throw Riley under the bus in high school (which was an incredibly shitty thing to do that I don’t feel Riley would be okay with by the end when Harper got outed), when it would’ve been a tough enough situation already for Harper to come out to her family. I don’t know about that entirely. I have seen people change their bigotries pretty quick when their child is involved. Of course, that does tend to be a minority of those types of people, but it is possible. I had a friend in high school who was adamant that if he had a child who was gay he “would disown them in a heartbeat.” It was a Sochi king and disgusting flaw in someone who was overall a decent guy. 

Well, many years later, whose son just came out as gay? Not his—he doesn’t have kids yet. But his nephew did! I can’t speak to how quickly his viewpoints changed, but I do know he is very vocally supportive of the lgbtq+ community now. The movie just wanted a tidy ending but I have seen it play out like that. The parent wanted to keep their child in their life over their belief system. Completely agree Straight up mental abuse from Harper and her parents. Unbelievable I do wonder if the chemistry between Aubrey plaza and Kristen Stewart elevated those few scenes from something flat that it was intended to be- sooooo much spark Agreed. It was fitting for her to see karma come back and bite front and center. Nice seeing civility displayed in regards to an ex lover. yea if they wanted to end it with kristen/aubrey they couldve made it a 2 hr movie and spent like 20 minutes building up their romance before pulling the trigger on it but it is what it is I think this is the problem with the whole movie.  I hated Harper.  There was no reason for us to want Abby to take her back.  I think her terrible behavior could be explained, but we didn’t see enough of good Harper to root for her in the first place.

That, and the fact that the family of psychopaths turns warm and loving in a matter of hours. This. She's denying her girlfriend exists, letting her get treated like garbage by her family, ditching her at event after event after event, and goes out drinking with her ex where they flirt much of the night? We were basically shouting at the screen for Abby to leave her the whole movie. And Harper only even hinted that all these difficulties were coming... after Abby was already in the car! That's a huge breach of communication and consent.

The ending felt totally unrealistic and tacked on and, imho, only works in the mind of a straight person who thinks of LGBT relationships as difficult and dysfunctional by default. Certainly, coming out to family is hard, but nobody should have to be treated like that by their future spouse. 

Just imagine Harper is a dude. There's no way the audience cheers for them to get back together after he ditches his girlfriend, flirts with his ex, lies, and shrugs when his family calls her ""poor"" (and accuses her of stealing), then shuns her from parties. [deleted] that bar scene with abby and riley had too much on screen chemistry tbh nah shes a doctor who has emotionally grown and moved on from her childhood so its not like her lifes bad by any means [aubrey agrees ](https://twitter.com/girlpash/status/1332171003670061057?s=10) thats the purpose of fanfiction and guess what, theres literally already a popular one on ao3 doing exactly that

https://archiveofourown.org/works/27721493 That's fair, sure. It also would've helped if Davis had some decent charisma with Stewart; we're shown in the opening montage that they're happy, and Abby and Harper both seem happy at the start with each other (Abby wants to propose, Harper wants her to have a great Christmas), but the actress isn't quite up to embodying that and really showing us their strong foundation. Also 6 months isnt that long... I personally think things might have looked better for Harper if she had come out to Connor—and that was why they were out so late—she was confiding in him and sharing what went wrong with their relationship. 

Or even just accidentally gushing about Abby after a few drinks. 

Or even on the sidewalk, when he asks where they went wrong, she comes out to him, and he respects that and keeps her secret. 

Or I was even hoping he’d come out and Harper would find the courage to do so as well! (And then Connor and John could end up together). 

I think something along these lines to that scene would have better shown Harper was simply struggling, but loved Abby and did want to be open about it. It also would have made hanging out until 2 am with her ex more understandable, in my eyes. 

I also was frustrated because, even though I get Harper’s behavior—she wasn’t just being a bad partner, but she was being a bad friend. If I had invited my actual roommate to come home with me for Christmas, I would have tried to include them and check in with them frequently and stand up for them when my family accused them of stealing. I get why Harper didn’t do those things, but still—not cool as a friend or girlfriend! It really was like the Wayne’s world bit.


The one thing I was kind of happy about was it seemed like the proposal was held off, and then they flashed the engagement ring. Maybe it's just my family but we'd get over stuff like that fairly easily. Also it probably helped that they just witnessed their daughter/sister have their heart broken by not being able to come out as a lesbian. She reminded me of Princess Buttercup/Jenny ""We've been so terrible to the people that we love the most! We need to ask for forgiveness and work on repairing the damage we've done to our children."" --said no narcissistic parents ever. Yeah they did not give her anything to work with. I saw her on Black Mirror and was really impressed with her on that show, so I know she can do way better. Yeah I thought Levy was gonna be the voice of reason like the TSA guy in get out, and then he came in and talked her into staying. Also it was so chaste, Aubrey plaza is like devilishly attractive in this and she doesn’t even get a smooch? Unfair. [deleted] He mentioned going to law school so I assume he’s a big partner Don't forget that Harper is in no danger of being thrown out because she's a working adult with her own place. She tells Abby *whose parents are literally dead* that she has to do all this bending over backwards because she can't lose her parents. Harper, you can't have your cake and eat it too. [removed] I watched this last night with my wife. I couldn't even finish it. I just read a plot summary. The more I read, the angrier I got. Then I read your comment and it just so perfectly summarizes how I feel about this pile of dog shit movie. Like legitimately lost some of the love and respect I had for these actors in this movie for reading this script and agreeing to be a part of it. It's so utterly bad it's offensive. Oh yeah, I forgot about the poor painting! (I wanted to hug her when I saw that.) I was thinking she went from being a total doormat to demanding respect too quickly but I can see how that combined with the shock of her sisters fighting would be a catalyst. Agreed. I know at one point NYE was mentioned so near the end I wondered if they would reconcile a few days later on NYE but thought that was still pretty quick to take her back. I'm fairly certain that Jane was the autistic character. It was interesting how the film never made that explicit and I got the impression that that choice was deliberate to imply that autism should be treated as just another way of thinking and not a novelty.

I think that's a step in the right direction towards respecting neurodiversity: Note how Jane is only awkward if one accepts the premise that conventional norms are necessarily the standard—or that mental health is measured by the statistical average. Autists can also have perfectly valid and rational perspectives and it's often just that: differences in perspectives between the neurodivergent and neurotypicals (of course, that's not to imply that neurodivergence precludes fallacious views or unhealthy thinking habits, but we should seek understanding before judging; also, don't forget that many of humankind's greatest minds were and are autistic). Haha true Fuckin' Jane.

That woman deserves the world! I was so pissed when that painting that wasn't even being appreciated got destroyed. I like that movie, but that whole fake caroler sign holding scene aged like milk. While I love '**Love Actually**', I feel personally that there is more cynicism in that film with several of the stories than this movie.

I think this movie's cuteness is spread out better over the runtime, but '**Love Actually**' has stronger cuter moments than this. I think some people would take Harper proposing as an abusive move as well.  Treating someone badly and then asking the same person to then marry them is too controlling. I think my issue was that, if that's true of the parents, Harper should have known this and come out to them before introducing them to her girlfriend. The movie makes it seem like she knows her parents well enough to know how they would react. It just makes Harper seem even worse.

I've been in the position where I met a boy's parents at Christmas while he was in the closet and I know what it's like first hand, to have toxic parents. With my parents, coming out had to happen after moving out because otherwise I'd be kicked out. With my bf then it was that they would stop paying for his college degree and cut him off financially.

I guess my issue is, in the movie there's nothing at stake for her to have been in the closet from them for so long as an adult. Idk I hated the movie TBH I'm assuming that the tracking is meant to allude to Find My Friends or Snapchat's version of it, the way that sharing our location 24/7 has become normalized in the past few years. Lol I agree totally, tho most people don't care about sexuality. Also I thought it was mentioned he was conservative but maybe I'm wrong. >  Romcoms are by and large not meant to show healthy relationships, because those don't sell as many tickets.

The actual issue is - You need conflict to have a plot. i got buster bluth vibes both from jane's behaviors and the way the family treated her. like, ""oh you're pretty much useless so just stand over there, we know *you* can't help with anything"". then there's how she tries to approach men, how she tries to participate in conversation, her general awkwardness. and these behaviors were used for comedic effect. it was a bit painful to watch.

EDIT: also the mom shooing her away from the guests at the party. and the family's solution for her night terrors was to put her in the basement. Definitely would have been considered weird in my family home to spend two hours alone in a bedroom with a guest, lol Yeah, I think DuVall tried to do the whole ""show, don't tell"" thing, but it wasn't terribly effective and people end up missing out on making the connection. For example - the impression I got was that Harper's kind of... disconnected from her old life, mentioning the boilerplate stuff to Abby but not going in much details. She definitely mentioned Riley to Abby, but did she even talk about her ""best friends"" from high school? She wasn't particularly looking out for them when she was home for the holidays, either - they came to her. 

I think the movie would have been better if we spent a bit more time with Abby and Harper *before* the trip, just to highlight how much of a pressure cooker being home is for Harper and how being in that environment led her to being the shitty friend and girlfriend she ended up being for most of the movie. 

Which actually brings me back to my first point about ""show, don't tell"". We're *told* that Abby and Harper have been together for a year now and Abby is head over heels enough that she wants to propose. But we're not *shown* much beyond the first scene where Harper invites Abby home with her for Christmas. The rest of the movie then shows Harper behave very poorly. Yeah, as soon as we started seeing the dynamics of the family I just kept thinking about how it's no wonder she's still hiding it. It really sucks that Abby was caught in the crossfire. I feel like not everyone is taking on board the importance of John's monologue. Sure, Harper probably didn't deserve forgiveness for the things she did, at least not right away. But I think she deserves some understanding and compassion given the hand she was dealt with her family.

People act like it's really easy to stand up to your parents, and that it's no big deal to lose them if they can't love you for who you are. And that was before being gay even came into the picture. You missed the internalized complexities of each individual if you can simplify things that way. 
Also, Abby also agreed to go along with this. She could have stopped the car as soon as Harper told her her parents didn't know. 
Which is kinda crazy and unbelievable due to the fact that they lived together. As if you wouldn't ask about your parents and know all this well in advance of moving in together, but yeah, it's a movie, so... Sucks that Schitt's Creek isn't on German Netflix. It's exclusively on TV Now which is the streaming service of one of the big privately-owned TV channels. They don't have other shows which interest me, so I guess, I'm gonna take the free trial month and try to watch as much of Schitt's Creek as I can :D And then she totally ignored her and abandoned her, leaving her alone in parties and going out with her ex late at night. You don’t treat an SO like that, especially when they’re staying in your parent’s house and just can’t get up and leave, ESPECIALLY when they’re doing you the huge favor of putting on an act and hiding themselves to respect your feelings, AFTER being completely blindsided and manipulated, going to your parent’s house expecting a whole different situation. The gall of Harper to pull this shit. Abby was completely in her right to break up with her. Being afraid to come out doesn’t justify this kind of behavior, sorry. A-fucking-men. Haha I rewatched it last night after watching Happiest Season. One of my favourite pieces of media ever. One of the best episodes of television ever made. Harper just texts Abby like ""Omg I'm so sorry I love you"" after putting her through a lot so that all comes off as really superficial and insincere. She also knows how risky it is to show affection there but still tries to get Abby to fool around when nobody there knows how to fucking knock. Like?? Do you think keeping the two lives separate would have been fair? Genuinely asking since thats where I land on it I think.

Like if Harper wanted to not have Abby come and keep her family separate from her girlfriend until she's ready that's obviously fine... BUT the flaw to me is inviting her, sticking her in the basement, and then doing everything else you just said. 

Idk it's weird because the movie knows Harper fucked up, she literally said she'd spend her life making it up to her if she had to and yet it felt like there was no downside to her actions, like Harper had her perfect happy ending anyways... I really think a lot of people are suggesting she should get with Riley purely cos they had better chemistry as actors and the film didn’t do a whole lot to set out why the Harper relationship was so amazing to start with. You basically don’t learn anything about their lives at all and even an extra couple of scenes might have done that Ship culture is the worst. Bring back platonic friendships of opposite and same sex friends. Haha!

I thought Kristen Stewart's acting was perfect. She also seems to know how to play the anxious type to the T, probably because she's so familiar with that mindset from personal experience. 👌👍

Even though Mackenzie Davis isn't a lesbian or is bisexual, her desperation in the end looked and felt so real and convincing. I bawled so hard in this film. 🥺 I got the impression from that beginning scene that he was a literary agent, which would make sense. (And also Jane's BFF in the end) same! it was really weird as the first few lines. they should've tied it up better at the ending. Haha, also same! I was so confused as to why John was sitting at the table with Jane. But oh yeah, that clunky line from earlier! I watched half of one movie in that series and the impression I got was that those two were hating their lives in a big way. If you didn’t see it - I recommend the Schitt’s Creek mini documentary on Netflix. They talk about how that phrase has made an impact on LGBTQ youth. Super touching end to the show.

https://www.netflix.com/title/81286241 Seriously, people would make terrible boring movies with ideas from Reddit She could've just said that they couldn't open their stocking since they were bad. It wouldn't have added any time I was just talking to a friend last night about that. Dan Levy basically plays Dan Levy, which is fine, because I could watch him play Dan Levy all day. I didn't see any David Rose personally. David would have quivered at the thought of having to take care of animals, and his HS character didn't have a drip of bougieness about him. Also Moira and Johnny didn't disown him for any stretch of time. Agreed completely. He was David with much of David's trauma and issues removed.

  


Also agree with everything else you've said. I'm glad we have him and I hope this role was deliberately a clone of Rose, rather than just how Levy will always act. So glad you wrote this cause i was going to respond with the exact same sentiment but you saved me the hassle. And the hassle of having to clarify when people seem to not understand. haha. It's funny you say that since multiple actors in this were also in the TV Show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Yeah I mean the way they acted when they thought they were just ""helping an orphan who has no family to spend Christmas with"" was deplorable, I can't imagine marrying into that family I sort of thought they were though? I didn’t think it was a wrapped up happy ending, just, this is the family you have so that’s it type ending. I’m gay and disagree.  It wasn’t just some run-of-the-mill fight; Harper was continuously a really bad partner and it was clear the issues ran deep.  Even if they were just friends her treatment of Abby was still pretty damn shitty. 

I really don’t see it as any different than wanting a straight female protagonist to end up with a different guy than the main male romantic protagonist.  Not everything is loaded with homophobic subtext, sometimes it really is as simple as liking the chemistry with one character more than another.  How do you know these other commenters aren’t queer as well?  You make a lot of cynical assumptions Lol, it has *nothing* to do with the characters being lesbians.

  


It's an incredibly common trope in romance movies for the distraught, mistreated partner to find a friend who turns out to be mr/Mrs right or turns into the ""lifelong friend who gets me and has my back!""

  


Abby and Riley were seemingly being pushed into the former of those options. She was portrayed as understanding, chill and genuinely wants to have fun. Which are all common reasons a character falls for the side character.

  


It's not some loosely hidden attack on LBGTQ+ culture - they got the exact same treatment 900+ rom-coms before this have gotten. If I had any awards to give, I'd give this one.

Like I get that Harper was toxic at points but also the film did a fair job showing what it was like to be in the closet and navigate really heteronormative spaces. One of the best pieces of advice I ever heard was that it helps to pretend your parent/grandparent/sensei/etc. is a time-traveler from the 19th century and you’re explaining our modern technology to them. *slinks to router*

*turns it off and on again* seriously, I got so mad at Harper when she threw that canvas. I can excuse toxic behavior, but I draw the line at destroying someone's work of art! Honestly Jane is too good for this world. What a cinnamon roll. Despite being treated the way she was by her parents AND sisters, she still loves them very much (""I love you guys!"") and is very willing to help out around the house (although it's probably partially because it's the only time she feels needed by her parents). Knew there would be some earwolfers in here I think this is too easily missable but for what it's worth - the instagram feed ending takes place over the course of about a year, so the ending isn't so much ""And they all lived happily ever after"", it's just that KStew gave MDavs another shot and she delivered. The engagement photo is the next October, so it takes them nearly a year to get back to that point. A lot of tall people I know are inclined to (consciously or not) try and make themselves seem smaller than they are around other people. Davis, I remember her saying that all the training for Terminator changed her posture a lot and she finds herself standing straighter, I'm wondering if she seems taller than she is just because she's comfortable in her height, if that makes sense. Mix that with the fact that some victims and survivors are just very good and forgiving people who are simply happy for a chance to move on. Yea this happened to me 100%.  Grew up with an evangelical family, didn't come out to them until I was 23, then two seconds after I did they're posting pride ally flags on Facebook.  I got whiplash. They’d also have to make Harper MUCH worse. Gays have like this kindred spirit with each other and, even if you have chemistry, we've all had to do so much emotional work that we know to step in and be a shoulder when needed.  Riley and Abby were hot for each other but the fact that they put that aside to be the right people is a more interesting dynamic and more honest to how gay friendships are. Agreed, usually in rom coms the side characters get paired off somehow so I expected that of her and it was good she wasn’t I’m ready to riot because I can’t stand Harper’s toxic selfish self. Oh trust me, lol, I know fanfiction. Very well, ha. And you’re right, this ship is going to find a great home on AO3. The devil works fast but fic writers work faster This is awesome! Yeah totally! Better chemistry would have helped a ton for sure. If you look at the timeline thing at the end, they didn't ultimately end up getting engaged until like October 2021, which is a 9 month delay, so there were definitely some lasting consequences to their relationship. I like that, but it could have been more prominently shown.

The main thing I think this movie needed at the end was a scene or two of Abby and Harper talking it out on Christmas Eve night after Abby agreed to stay, showing how they had begun to fix their relationship. I believe it happened, but it shouldn't have been offscreen. She’s at her best in an AMC show called Half and Catch Fire. One of the best shows of the last decade. She’s great in Tully, the latest Terminator and Always Shine. Oh and Blade Runner 2049. Have you seen black mirror, san junipero episode? The actress who plays Harper is in it. Basically plays the same character but I liked her in San junipero and hated her in happiest season lol. Yeah, just allowing the terrible situation to occur at all was her biggest mistake. I think by that point in the car she was rationalising and becoming manically optimistic, letting herself think that maybe it'd all work out.

However, without that huge lapse in judgement, there'd be no movie, so I don't think it'd be an easy problem to fix. Right. So that makes a lot of sense. He was partner at a law firm while serving as a councilman, and left the firm to run for mayor. Oh yeah, i didn't even consider this. She faces no homelessness, either. What a jerk. 

I might need to double check but I think the orphan thing was a lie made up by the pathological liar protagonist. I think she made it up to trick her parents into thinking Abby was some Dickensian street urchin, to further justify why she had to bring an apparent random home for Xmas. That's why Abby was so woefully underprepared when faced with questions about her parents. Yep. This film is just rewarding bad behaviour. And I do not appreciate the (small) amount of people I've met who defend Harper purely because she's a minority. Shit is shit no matter how big the demographic. It's hard to imagine Harper being set up as a such a villain accidentally.  To me the simplest explanation is Hollywood money-people forced it to change from 'breakup with Harper' to a 'happy ending'. I can see how this would happen, but I do still appreciate the actors & even the director. I think Stewart has come a long way & proven herself since the Twilight days. 

I kind of think how awful this film turned out to be was due to extreme thoughtlessness, not from malice. It may have read half-decently on a script but when put all together on the big screen the message (which I still think was accidental) was too awful to miss. 

I only say this because the director is a prominent lesbian actress & she said she based it on her experiences, which based on her age I can believe. I just think that she should have set the film in the 80s or 90s when her experiences took place, then it may have worked a little better. In the setting & time frame she chose it was anachronistic to the point of being extremely offensive. 

Still one of the most horrible films ever made. But I think it was accidentally horrible so I feel I can't hold it against the actors too much.

I did just watch it with my friend though & he said it was like the gay version of 'Get Out', which I thought was spot-on & hilarious. He said without the jingle jingle music it would have been flat-out horror movie. And it was a really sweet painting too! I expected them to unwrap the painting and it be something related to her fantasy novel, and the movie treat it like ""Oh how awkward,"" but the Main Street angle was really lovely. So did the two power-imbalance relationships (prime minister and secretary, writer and his house cleaner he couldn't even speak to) I didn’t like the movie either but I think with abusive parents your trauma responses obscure a lot of realistic scenarios. I come from a family like Harper’s and while I agree she was a shitty shitty gf I just don’t see how she could have anticipated their reaction as it happened given their prior behavior. My parents have been physically abusive to me over my perceived lesbianism (I’m not out to them yet but I’m out to all of my siblings) yet they were very respectful and even happy for my friend’s transition. There are a lot of different factors and I think Harper is to blame for not telling Abby she wasn’t out until they were on their way home, for abandoning Abby while home both to her family and to old friends, and for doubling down on refusing to come out when she was outed. But not for her responses to her family Thanks, my daft ass assumed it was literally some tracking chip I also thought was painful to watch, mainly from how bad people treated her (and not that she was awkward). I interpret these behaviors from Jane as being very high agreeableness personality traits, not autistic traits. She is just on the high extreme of agreeableness, all her scenes are about being extremely nice, warm and friendly (way too much for her family social circle). It is absolutely not her fault she was surrounded by shitty people, it would not be awkward if people didn't treat her bad (for example, in the holiday party it is her turn to choose and she says ""wooow all these gifts look so nice"" and her mother ""just choose one Jane...""). I also think the movie does a good job of showing something I experience which is if you are too nice, people just step over you, because they know you will not do anything bad back or even stand up for yourself.
I re-watched her scenes to re-assess, and I still think she doesn't have autistic traits, and she was certainly not created to be autistic. I wouldn't be against it if she were though, I think the movie shows her family as being shitty, not her - she is great and everyone that watches loves her. (Which btw also shows another thing of being high agreeableness, which is that people tend to like you, but not respect you) Yeah, I think they were trying to be a bit too clever by folding their romance the opening credits. I get what they were going for, with the whole seasonal/calendar thing, but doing that much storytelling in still images isn't the same as playing it out. 

I doubt most people even noticed they story it was telling (ie ""Here's Abby and Harper being an awesome couple for the last year, and check out how Harper confidently doing all the running and romancing!"") but it's pretty key to the premise of the movie to follow. Harper staying out with her ex till 2 am isn't complex, it's shitty behavior. Harper omitting details about her past to her partner isn't complex, it's deceitful. They've been together for a year and have mislead each other. It's not a healthy relationship Yes exactly!!  I always wondered why Harper just couldn't tell her girlfriend early on in the relationship that she's not out to her family and that whole situation...how hard is it to give that heads up... It's incredible. Even visually it's incredible. Some day I would love to see it on a cinema screen, those big dreamy vistas are so lush. I think it would’ve been better to keep those lives separate. I personally like to keep my dating life private from my family at least until it gets serious, but I’ve found at a certain point keeping it separate is almost impossible (holidays being the best example there). I’m sure at some point Abby would’ve taken issue with having a relationship Harper’s family didn’t know about, especially if they got married. That’s fair too because keeping things private can get exhausting.

But people deserve the time they need to be ready to come out and share those things with their families. You’re absolutely right that the issue was her *inviting* Abby home from the holidays only to force her into the closet. Not to mention lying to her until they were on their way to the house about her parents knowing. I’m not tryna shame someone for not wanting to come out because I understand that, but it’s still important to consider your partner’s feelings. Yeah can't say I disagree. Both with fictional characters and irl people, cause this shipping stuff happens a lot in real life, too (""Oh you're single? This random person I met in the grocery store is also single, you two should date."") It made them a ton of money and the freedom to choose better projects. I’m not talking about the story or character I’m talking about Dan’s acting. Same mannerisms, same style, same delivery, same...everything. That’s not range. He has this head bob eyebrow raise thing that I thought was just for David Rose but he used it this movie too. Before the scene about coming out experiences I was sad that he seemed to be playing David rose all over again Wait, which actors were on CXG? People have married into my family and they are bigger assholes than that. Not only this but Harper showed signs of being a straight up shitty person when things don’t go her way. 

The way she acted with Conner and what she did Riley is sketchy as shit. But this is happening all over a period of like the first 2 days of being there. If it was a few weeks of erratic behavior, then absolutely. But this is all within a very short amount of time. We all saw they did not get a lot of alone time to properly communicate what they were dealing with while they were there. Could it been handled differently, obviously. But a few mistakes like getting caught up in conversations that make it difficult for you to get back to your partner should not be considered grounds to leave the person you love for. Staying out later with friends while the other wants to go home is also not unheard of. During the holidays on the first time visiting, it definitely is a bit insensitive, but Abby told her she is fine with her staying out longer. What really needed to happen was for Abby and Harper to just go out in the town by themselves one of those days and communicate instead of holding onto all their anger/stress for short bursts where they couldn't fully express their feelings. 

There have been times where I have had my ex over for the holidays and everything gets so hectic within the first few hours of everyone showing up that we got separated in the household. I always made sure to make my way back to him but things get a bit chaotic and you just have to hold on until the holidays are over. I grew up in a very similar family as Harper's and its always stressful around the holidays. Everyone is tense, there is fake cheer everywhere, and we sweep every minor argument under the rug. Its a very difficult environment to grow up in and seeming to make any mistake can lead to incredibly harmful mental health issues. I've been through therapy for my anxiety and if Harper was my friend in real life, I would suggest it to her as well. I can relate to the immense pressure and stress she would be in in this situation. 

The problem with this is that Riley never made any moves or suggestions of them getting together. She was there because she saw Abby going through stress and could recognize it. Laughing together as they destress over a beer in a gay club shouldn't be ""omg they are so cute together!!! they should totally hook up now!"". Queer people can just be friends and form tight connections over shared experiences and feeling each other's vibes. That is exactly what those two were doing. I'm getting major, ""I have a gay friend you should TOTALLY meet! You two should totally date it would be SO cute!!"" vibes from this thread You can excuse toxic behaviour? was she not bad enough as is?? Harper is a down-right emotionally abusive character from what we see. She's pretty damn bad While Riley probably did have an attraction to Abby, I honestly didn't get the impression that Abby was into Riley that way at all. She seemed 100% hung up on Harper the entire movie, which would make sense for her character.

The two of them got along really well and Riley was being a very supportive friend to her, and I enjoyed their dynamic a lot, but I just didn't see it as more than that. Riley never looked like she was planning to make a move, she was too nice to jeopardise someone else's relationship like that. She did seem to get paired off in the instagram feed over the credits. She’s not only selfish, she’s so so stupid sometimes. She’s lucky. yea theres already a dozen popular fics about abby/riley and its only been like a day lol Honestly Cameron read more queer in that show than Harper did in this movie And Halt and Catch Fire! Yeah, he also mentioned Alison Brie being in line for a partner position and then through gritted teeth complimented her for leaving it all to be a mom, so it sounded like it struck a cord with him. No she said she lost her parents at 19. [removed] Just the fact that Harper waited ti the car ride shows her manipulation The night scenes where they're at the beach and the city lights in the background... incredible. Yeah, can't fault them for doing it. Personally idgaf about range and I don’t know why so many people do. Not all actors need to be Leonardo DiCaprio, the personality/character that Dan can bring to a project just being different variations of David Rose are invaluable and I’d still love him if that’s all he ever brought to the table as an actor.

As others have said, he stole every scene he was in here vastly improving the movie as a side character despite not demonstrating “range” - that’s plenty for me and I want more! Eric the father of the twins is on CXG as Jim the guy who sings ""Don't be a Lawyer"" and Jane is on CXG in a very tiny role as the cat store clerk during the song ""Buttload of Cats"" It’s not a ludicrous or small-minded thought to like the chemistry between Abby & Riley more than Abby & Harper.  They even shot an ending where Abby & Riley ended up together; a romantic connection isn’t completely out of the question just because people start out as friends/confidants.  

And the erratic behavior included gaslighting Abby and calling her suffocating and leaving her alone at every single party she invited her to, even when they could’ve hung out as “friends.”  Her not being out doesn’t really explain all of the rudeness - it would’ve been really hurtful even if they really were just roommates.  I guess I just don’t understand why wanting two friends to end up together is such a malicious and problematic thing.  It doesn’t necessarily mean people want them to be together solely because they’re both queer. it's obviously a joke. She was flawed but not evil. i think the thesis of the movie was about communication and how the breakdown of honest communication can lead to the breakdown of relationships, so honestly it was a two way streak between abby and harpers characters. harper was dealing with coming out while abby was reading too much into harpers actions due to the breakdown of honest communication between the two. remember that abby went from about to propose to harper to about to dump her in like 3 days all because of a series of miscommunications That shows cast was perfect Agreed! It really isn’t necessary and it shouldn’t preclude him from getting roles. I just don’t agree when someone sees a fun role he’s in and says “what range!” That’s just not what that is Meanwhile, his persona on the Great Canadian Baking Show came across as a little socially awkward to me. I haven't seen his Hot Ones Interview yet, but I'm curious since Sean seems to do a great job of bringing out some genuine personality from the celebrities. His song is absolutely incredible, I watch it all the time Ironically, Burl Moseley, who sings ""Don't Be A Lawyer"", is a recovering lawyer in this movie. >They even shot an ending where Abby & Riley ended up together

I tried googling this but couldn’t find anything about it, where did you read/hear this? Yeah I know, I thought we [were riffing on this *Community* gag](https://youtu.be/15QFAppht5o?t=45). My bad. True, but how many exes are truely evil? She put Abby through multiple things that when added up deserve a break-up. Had the writers gone that route, it could have shown Abby and Harper breaking up, Harper growing on her own and that family growing too, and Abby getting over the relationship,  possibly getting better-aquainted with Riely and possibly dating her. And then at the end, Abby and Harper run into each other, are able to make some amends but fully move on from each othe (like what Riely and Harper did). Not a Christmasy ending, though. yep, theyd basically have to make her cheat with her ex-bf if they wanted to make her an actual terrible person rather than just a flawed person in a distressed state More like because she was hella flirting with the ex-boyfriend she was keeping secret. Harper switched up HARD, you can’t blame Abby for reading the room like she did. But you are right, communication is key. Maybe if Harper didn’t lie about coming out to her family, Abby wouldn’t have so much egg all over her face. Fair enough, I can’t disagree with that! oh yeah lol, I just thought you were being serious and didn't want to get dragged haha, sorry! Scott Pilgrim joins the chat. They probably deserved a breakup but also deserved a reconciliation also. I’m 20 days late with this but Harper was “hella flirting” after she saw Abby in town with Riley and then Riley lied by omission about it later. Harper was obviously more in the wrong throughout the whole movie but Abby wasn’t 100% innocent in this instance. ",0
148,"Charles told clone Wolverine about how that was one of the best nights he's had in a long time, but the real Logan never knew how much Charles appreciated that dinner. Wolverine's leap is the greatest shit ever  [removed] One of the best moments of the movie was when suddenly out of the blue, Laura started speaking Spanish and began fighting with Logan after being mute for more than half of the movie. You know I think that part where Logan tried to crash through the fence is the first I've ever seen that fail.  Normally the fence goes down like it was paid to lose. Magneto was right I loved all the subtle references that gave us a glimpse into the future; tigers are extinct, self-driving tractor trailers and the mass-consumption of corn syrup.  Patrick Stewart looked like he was enjoying the ""grumpy cheeky old bastard"" role so much, but Dafne Keen knocked it out of the park. Incredible acting.

Going to miss Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.   Yukio in **The Wolverine** (2nd film) 

> *I saw you die. A while ago. But it's not like I get a complete picture. More like looking through a keyhole. But I'm always right. All I can see is one part of a person's life... their death. And I saw yours.* 
*I see you on your back. There's blood everywhere. You're holding your own heart in your hand.* 

 Logan died on his back, holding his daughter's hand. [deleted] How badass was that hotel scene with Logan just stabbing the fuck out of the dudes while they were frozen? I also loved how the very first 5 minutes of the movie were just so brutal and opened with him saying fuck. It was like a preview of things to come. I thought one of the saddest moments was when they're leaving the casino with all the people on the floor and Prof X weakly says ""I'm sorry. I'm very sorry."" Loved the final moments of Logan's life, when they called back to him and Xavier's final conversation. I'm paraphrasing here but Xavier said something along the lines of ""this is what I wanted for us, to have a home, being surrounded by the people who love you, you should take a moment and feel what it's like Logan, it's not too late for you"". So when Logan, on his dying breaths said ""huh, so that's what it feels like"" I was absolutely crushed.  It wasn't too late for him, after countless years of pain and suffering he finally experienced love even if it was just for a few fleeting moments. This is the perfect film to show why it's important that not every superhero movie should be about saving the world. The stakes felt more real here than in the other big movies. They took a big risk having such a young kid play such a pivotal role and it totally paid off. Dafne Keen was absolutely *phenomenal*. And for such a young actress! I am totally ready for a Wolverine/Laura/X-23 spin-off starring Keen.

Nice spin on the Old Man Logan story where [Charles is the one who killed the X-Men](#spoiler).

I really enjoyed this. I'm sad to see Jackman go, but this was a good note to go out on. I'm curious to see where they go next. I think Patrick Stewart needs to be nominated for Best supporting actor.  I let out an audible, ""Holy shit,"" when X-23 was impaled in the chest with that harpoon gun.  I don't think I've ever seen such centerfold gore happen to a child on-screen for a Hollywood movie.  

Dafne Keen definitely brought the right level of ferocity and physicality to X-23.  Those blood curdling battle screams... When he was burying Professor Xavier and was having trouble speaking, I was about to lose it. Hugh Jackman is an incredible actor and captured that pain so perfectly. Wolverines story is a tragedy, and the way they portrayed that was perfect. He's been through hell, and you feel that. You really feel how tired he is. 

""So that's what it feels like"".

When he said that, my eyes watered up. He was finally happy.


Gosh that was a fucking beautiful movie.  Gotta comment again, holy shit it was so good.

Really interesting/terrible how they showed Xavier's decline due to whatever condition he had (ALS/Alzheimer's?). When X24 killed him, it really tore me apart when Logan was telling him ""it wasn't me"" when he was carrying him to the truck, knowing he was probably so confused. In the end he just wanted to get to the sea...

Also tore me up when laura finally called him daddy. Fuck...

Such great world building tho, really felt like an accurate, solid depiction of what 2029 will be, realistically. The self driving 18wheelers were a nice touch.

I could go on and on, but y'all saw it, y'all know what all I'll say lol I didnt realize this until a couple hours after I watched but Logan wanted the boat so he can take Charles (and himself) away from innocent people. If he has another seizure, there's no people he can hurt in the middle of the sea. I can't believe how incredible Dafne Keen was as X-23, I hope she gets the chance to play the character more.

Also, that opening with Deadpool was amazing!

Edit: I guess some theaters didn't show it, but there was a scene with Deadpool before the movie started.  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ezsReZcxU) the official version for those that missed it. The sequence where Wolverine stumbles through everyone being still because of Charles' seizure at the hotel was an incredible scene I went to the first showing today at the IMAX in Lincoln Square (NYC). They were only letting people in by groups of 20. Weird, right? I turn the corner and HUGH JACKMAN shakes my hand and goes, ""Hi - enjoy the film"" - he greeted every fan one by one as we entered. 


OH. AND THE MOVIE WAS SICK!


EDIT: Grammar. Patrick Stewart broke my heart. ""Our boat...""

Hugh Jackman broke my heart. ""So this is what it feels like...""

Dafne Keen broke my heart. ""Daddy..."" Favorite bit was that the real wolverine had genuine fear in his eyes when he realized he was basically fighting himself in his prime. 

Made you realize just how dangerous a real savage wolverine is.  I never thought I'd cry during a superhero movie, let alone an X-Men movie. Wonderful, wonderful film. Nice to see it was as much a character study as it was anything else. I was a grinning uncontrollably seeing Logan and Laura arrive safely with her friends, and a quiet wreck with Laura's final act in the film. Johnny Cash was perfect for the credits. 

I'm going to go watch it again next week.  One small thing I liked about the movie was how they depicted the ""future."" Most movies will make the future out to be either this technological utopia with flying cars and robot butler's or a dystopia that is equally far-fetched. The ""futuristic"" elements seemed very much more realisitic in this movie as in real life technology is adapted slowly on a large scale so minor things like the TV in the hotel looking similar just bigger, to the more obvious things like the self driving trucks looked more like they were built off of current things we have instead of a total 180 from present society. The movie reminded me a lot of Children of Men, just a little less bleak  I did not expect the [Wolverine clone](#spoiler), that was a nice surprise. Props to the marketing team for not spoiling that. 

Edit: Just discovered that it was hinted at in the Apocalypse post credit scene. I guess Xmen does have some regard for continuity. 

Edit 2: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvjcNU46lQg) Remember that time a movie actually lived up to its excellent marketing?  Did anyone notice how X23 avoids consuming corn syrup throughout the movie? She eats corn flakes instead of sugary cereal and when she is about to drink a soda, it gets knocked out of her hand. The family they have dinner with refused to use the genetically modified corn. How the fuck am I suppose to watch any other X-men movie after this? Like, this is THE END. Close the book, toss it aside and set it on fire. Are they going to even make anymore after this? And if so are they aware that it will have to be amazingly good not to look like shit compared to this? And every X-Men movie after this will be compared to this.

Jesus. One of my favourite moments was Will turning the gun on Logan after the barn massacre. It just seemed so raw and realistic in a way that comic book movies usually aren't. A PG-13 movie would probably have Will give Logan some look of forgiving recognition and just dropping the shotgun.

But this is basically a western and feelings are rough as FUCK. Does anyone else think that buzzcut Logan looks a LOT like Liev Schreiber's Sabretooth? It's very easy to buy the fact that they are brothers. SPOILER
Shout out to the young black guy for sharing your ipod. You were a total bro :'( Even though you knew where this was going character-wise before you even watched it, it still made me teary-eyed at the end. The whole marketing campaign for this film really emphasized how real and grounded it would feel. Man, did they nail it.

Thank you, Hugh Jackman for bringing my favorite comic book character to life in such a nuanced and human way. The movies may not have always scored a home run, but you sure did. 

And thank you Sir Patrick Stewart for bringing one of the most iconic comic characters of all time from the strip to the screen in a committed and timeless performance that we will all remember forever.


Thank you :') This movie was everything I wanted and more. Brutal, sincere, the right amount of funny, and at the end of it all heart wrenching. An amazing send off for Wolverine and potentially the single best superhero movie I have ever seen.

I hope this movie (alongside Deadpool) paves the way for R rated superhero movies in a variety of genres. With real respect for the characters and source material there is no reason why we can't have more big budget and high quality superhero movies like Logan.

10 out of fucking 10. What a great sendoff. The action scenes were brutal, white knuckle, and perfect.  That farmhouse scene with X-24 though.  Wow. Amazing movie. ""There's water..."" 
""Don't be what they made you..."" 

Good luck to any X-Film following this one SPOILERS



Laura turning the cross into an X made me lose it I sobbed. Man, as a mexican, i was moved by the fact that the Nurses were Heroic as fuck, mexican motherly instinct is no joke, and it reminded me of some cases where mothers have saved random kids from Cartel shootings, even if that was just a small part from the movie, i like that portrayal, kudos to the writer(s) I got fucking chills when Laura turned that cross to an X. What a great way to end a film. I don't think any other future X-Men movies can even come close to topping this one. Yukio told Logan he'd die with his heart in his hands. He died holding the daughter he loved. I'll be over here peeling onions thanks. Such a good, good movie.  I've been a Wolverine fan my entire life.  I was also one of those people, at first, who thought a 6' 4"" Aussie had no business playing a 5' 3"" Canadian.  I promptly shut that shit down after seeing the cage fight in X-Men. I thought ""Logan"" was an excellent capper to the 17 years we've spent with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. 

Also, the double meaning of ""So this is what it feels like..."" just hit me.  Both the feeling of having a real family to care about, and the feeling of (finally) dying with no coming back. And the X cross.  God dammit.  I gotta see this again.  [deleted] Watching this movie left me feeling similar to how I felt while playing the Last of Us. Tiny shimmers of hope in a very bleak world...  ""So..that's what it feels like."" Damn when Logan said that line I almost teared up :(..  

Thank you Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart for delivering incredible performances throughout the film. Dafne Keen was also brilliant , very badass and likable.   

Overall, Logan is super violent (love all the bloody action sequences..), emotional, touching, an amazing final chapter for Logan/Wolverine. In my opinion, Logan is not only the best Wolverine film ever, I'd argue it's also the best X-Men movie yet.  

Give it a 9.5/10. Go watch it ASAP.
 [deleted] I was already tearing up when Logan was dying but when Laura said ""Daddy.""

Fuck.   ""Daddy""

Not fair movie, not fair at all. [deleted] I started to cry when he got punctured by the log because I knew what was coming, started crying when she called him daddy, and lost my fucking shit with the X. We've all watched these movies for over a decade now and to see it end in such a beautiful way was satisfying and heartbreaking all at once. Thank you Hugh. :') As a 26 year old, I felt like I just watched my childhood die at the end  The movie was amazing, the Prof X lines were always on point, hearing all the swearing from him always got a laugh at my screening. The girl was plays X-23 was amazing too, her facial reactions very always on point which made the last scene even better. Hugh Jackman was Hugh Jackman never gives a bad performance and get a well deserved ending in a great movie

i got really teary eyed on the last scene dam gonna miss Hugh Jackman, thanks for the 17 years... 

10/10 Never in my life have I seen so many grown men crying and wiping there eyes walking out of my theater. Loved the movie. Hugh Jackman will always be Wolverine to me.


Edit: I'm a fellow sobbing grown man [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Man. I have no connection to the X-Men universe and haven't seen any previous Wolverine movie, but god damn what a film. 

It's so unflinchingly dark from start to finish. It honestly reminds me of The Last of Us in so many ways -- the side story at the farmhouse which ends with nothing but more death, the cross-country journey, and of course the relationship between Logan and Laura. 

The brutality of it all really caught me off guard. I honestly can't imagine how this movie could've been made without an R rating, even if some of the language and the brief flash of nudity is unnecessary. And all the action is so no-frills, too. A lot of people get stabbed, but there aren't any flashy set pieces to get in the way of the blood and decapitations. Even every major character death happens so fast with no room for closure. 

I also have to say that final shot was tremendous. It's always the small details that hit the hardest, and goddamn what a detail.

I had no idea what to expect from Logan, but I can already tell it's gonna stick with me for a while. What a bleak, fucked-up universe this is. Where do I begin? What a bleak, brutal, and amazing film. 

The seizure scene in the casino was my favorite.

Xavier's monologues.

The (many) decapitations.

The fucking pine needle tornado kill was so badass.

Turning the cross to an X. :(

""Daddy."" T_T

My wife had tears streaming down her face.

My god, that was my favorite X-Men movie yet. Holy balls. My entire theater was in stunned silence at the end.

Oh, and motherfucking DEADPOOL.  There were children sitting beside me... Did any one else have the Deadpool teaser before the film? Logan is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen in terms of character development, action, and making the stakes feel real. So many nowadays (Age of Ultron, Suicide Squad, BvS, etc.) throw away anything genuine in favor of mass spectacle. 

I've always l Ioved Hugh Jackman in this role, and he finally got the chance to do something beyond just growling and making faint references to the pain he's in. I felt so bad for Wolverine in this movie (and Xavier, and the kids!).

The action was so intense because it all felt real, you really felt every stab or gunshot he took with his lack of healing. And that part near the end when he went full berserker was just fantastic. 

The thing I really loved was the character moments. They actually took the time to slow the movie down and really make you feel for every character. That entire segement with the family on the farm was something i never expected from this movie. When Xavier said he didn't deserve that good day, I felt so bad for him. When Wolverine was dying and finally felt what it was like to have a family, I cried. 

I could keep going but it'll turn into an even bigger wall of text than this already is, Logan is a fantastic send off to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It's emotional, intense, has the type of action you've always wanted out of Wolverine, and was never boring. I can't wait to see it again.

P.S. Good on you Fox for putting Deadpool at the beginning, it really wouldn't have worked after that ending. I feel like this was Wolverine's coming of age movie. Also, thank goodness they went for rated R. They were able to really dig in and show the kind of life Laura had up until that point. Seeing that child early in the movie  already knowing what she had to do keep herself safe. I was heartbroken from the beginning. I almost expected the gravestones to move at the end. I'm glad they didn't. The overall ambiguous story ending is something I have to chew on, but I think I'll like it more as time goes on.

This is not a movie to hang a franchise on. And that in itself is a surprising and brave decision. This may change if the main X-Men franchise doesn't do well but for now, this is perhaps the right movie for the right time, and is about as perfect as you can ask for.

While I've been tempering my box office expectations, I wouldn't be surprised if this ended up doing Deadpool money. And it deserves it.

Oh and I want to praise Dafne Keen for essentially carrying scenes by herself. I expect to see more of her in the future. * I **love** the lighting for the opening scene at the gas station

* Donald Pierce's southern accent is pretty hilarious

* Nearly cried during the dinner scene but I managed to hold it together

* I legit thought X-24 was Liev Schreiber for a sec

* Was surprised to hear Dafne Keen's voice. Thought she'd sound like Emma Stone

* ""So that's what it feels like"" made me lose my shit I honestly think that was the best comic book film since Dark Knight.  It just realized what people wanted in a Wolverine film.  It was dark gritty, beautifully shot.  I mean it was amazing This was the wolverine movie i've been waiting for since i first saw the 2000 xmen trailer. The fight scenes were superb and had real weight to them. In fact there was one moment where Laura bounces off someone much larger than her rather than taking him down which was a nice touch. You really get a sense of what a perfect killing machine Wolverine actually was. Finally did justice to the old line ""i'm the best there is at what i do, and what i do isn't very nice""

**Spoilers from here on out**

I thought the story was great, and the weakening of Wolverine was well executed with the adamantium poisoning finally taking its toll on his body. Charles having a degenerating brain disorder causing him to be the most dangerous man on the planet was great and it was interesting they switched the 'Old man Logan' plot point of Wolverine destroying the xmen to Charles; whilst leaving some ambiguity as to what specifically happened.

Laura was fantastic, you really got a sense of what Logan might have been like during his early days with weapon X (properly this time) through seeing what an incredible killing machine she was.

I thought the main villain was pretty good. With a character like wolverine it's hard to make a decent villain that can go toe-to-toe with him without weakening him unless they have adamantium or an equal healing factor. So I thought it was cool that the main antagonist was just a mercenary type who used the assets he had available and who didn't even really care about Logan, just the cargo he was now carrying. 

I think the Xander probably could have done with a bit more screen time and development, i felt he kinda just appeared without really going into how he was the guy in charge and the real threat to the children.

Now I have a feeling x-24 is going to be quite a decisive character, but I thought he was the perfect final antagonist for Logan. Seriously, who better for Logan to face off against, here at the end of it all, than his own worst enemy; himself. Logan has to defeat himself at his worst, pure rage and animalistic brutality. I thought the symbolism of the fight and the consequences of it, win or lose, was fantastic. And the parallels with Laura, both being two sides of Wolverine, was cool. Not to mention dying by his own hand.

I was expecting Logan to have to kill Charles after we see the first couple seizures but they probably didn't want to make it too similar to X3 or similar tropes. Instead the result developed Logan and Laura's relationship which was nice.

One thing that might have been nice was a bit more of a reaction from Logan after learning what she went through and what she is, considering how deeply traumatic the weapon x program and what was done to him was. There was a nice final line from Logan to Laura regarding this, but a little bit more might have been nice earlier just of Logan alone or with charles.

Also I think the death was so much better than 'Death of Wolverine'. Was a truly fitting end for Logan to not only die by his own hand but to tell his 'daughter' not to become like him. Not sure if anyone else has had to deal with a family member having Alzheimer's or any brain degenerative illnesses, but seeing Charles in the beginning really broke my heart cause it felt so real. People laughed when he was rambling incoherently and saying random things and swearing a lot, but that's how it was when my grandma had it before she passed.

On a lighter note, seeing Logan tearing up through bodies in the forest after taking the serum was very uplifting, as it was like seeing how he was in his prime one last time

This was a brutal, dark, and beautiful film. Hugh Jackman and the cast did an excellent job, a great farewell to the series   A rage-fueled, spanish-speaking, heart-breaking X-23 is something I didn't know I needed in my life until I saw Logan. I loved the pacing throughout the film. There were moments of high-octane ultraviolence, but they were woven between drawn out moments of compelling character interactions. The biggest negative I could think of were the scenes where the cgi really stood out as unrealistic. Particularly during the last act. They didn't detract from the overall experience, though. 
I watched the film this afternoon in Busan, and I was one of the last ones to leave the theater along with a middle-aged Korean woman. We shared the elevator out of the theater and she was just wiping away the tears. It was a powerful ride, regardless of anyone's dedication to the X-Men series.

Such a great film. My favorite ""superhero"" movie since The Dark Knight. I've been watching Hugh Jackman's Wolverine since I was in elementary school. I'm glad they found such a fantastic way to end his saga. [As soon as Xavier got stabbed I was convinced he was going to wake up and it would all have been a dream, that type of fake-out has been done so many times. When the movie kept going I was genuinely fully shocked, they did a really good job at keeping the X-24 thing hidden which I guess is easier because they didn't have to cast someone new and then have people speculating and guessing it. Saying that though I think it would have worked a lot better with Daken than Jackman vs. Jackman, obviously they're keeping him open as an option for future films and so wouldn't have allowed him to be used, although the symbolism of Logan fighting himself is obviously powerful so maybe I'm completely wrong.](#spoiler) 

Also please please please can we just get X-23 in the normal X-Men continuity, I don't care if they don't explain it at all, I don't care if Deadpool and Cable just turn up and time travel her over, the timeline's fucked, at least take advantage of that and utilise one of the best castings ever as much as you can. Shoutout to Deadpool, without it there would be no rated R Wolverine film.. And boy from the start you can see why we need a hardcore Wolverine film. It's very gory, bloody and fucking awesome.  

I didn't feel like I was watching a superhero movie, rather a western film (just the main character happens to have claws). I can't appreciate Hugh Jackman enough for his performance in this film. He is broken, vulnerable, and miserable.  Thank you Hugh Jackman, I'll truly miss Logan/Wolverine.  

I'm gonna go watch it again, and next time I'll try not to tear up in the end.. Dafne Keen really blew me away as X-23. Her battle cries are haunting – so much anger, channeled the only way she knows... extreme violence.

I also loved all the X-Men references, like the comics and especially the boy at the end holding the Wolverine action figure. Man, I did not expect Hugh Jackman to get killed by Hugh Jackman.

In all seriousness, what a great film. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart did such a great job for one last film. When Laura whispers ""Daddy"", I lost it. 

10/10 Best X-Men film If this wasn't a marvel action movie, there would be talks about a potential Oscar nomination. Hugh Jackman really brought his A game  Logan is a superhero movie that will make grown men leave the theater sobbing.

Laura saying ""Daddy"" broke my heart. D:

Edit: typo I really, really like how much this film respected my intelligence. It didn't spoonfeed me a thing. It showed what it needed to show and let **me** put together the pieces. The filmmakers trusted **me** to pick up on their subtleties.  The kid holding the wolverine action figure at the end. Oh man, I lost it hard. I know the flood gates opened for everyone when Professor X died or when Logan died...

... but, for me, nothing made me lose it like that one scene after X-24 gets shot with the shotgun by the father in the corn fields. 

That one scene when the dad, after losing everything he ever loved just because of the dangers that Wolverine brought with him, put the shotgun up the Logan and pulled the trigger. That look of pure hopelessness when he realized it was out of ammo was just so powerful, man.

He invited Logan, Professor X, and X-23 over for dinner without even realizing what he was getting into. The mom discovering her son dead was also a pretty sad scene, too. This hurt my heart so much. I am gonna miss Hugh's interpretation onscreen, but this was a hell of a way to go out. Well done.  I'm no father but hearing Laura call Logan ""daddy"" was gut wrenching. God damn. Logan: ""Let me see""
Charles: ""BLEHHHHH"" Can we all take a second and appreciate how much the violence added to this film. There is nothing more entertaining then watching wolverine decimate his foes with one fell slash. This is the violence a gritty hero like wolverine deserves.   Both Hugh Jackman and Sir Patrick Stewart deserve Oscars for their performances. Sir Patrick Stewart managed to perfeftly blend the dignity and compassion of a former Professor with the stubborn helplessness of an Alzheimers patient. As someone who has witnessed multiple loved ones go through the stages of degenerative brain disease, I was truly touched by his acting in this film and I'm sure it will stick with me for some time to come. Amazing fucking movie. Deadpool at the beginning, like, what a way to start. 

Logan ripping limbs from the get go. Amazing relationship between Logan and Xavier, and then the tear jerking x23 funeral scene. 

I'm glossing over because this movie was just incredible in every way. I can't believe this is the only time we will get an r rated hugh Jackman.  Patrick Stewart know all about that Taco Bell. +

:(

:'( This very well could be my favorite comic book movie to the day. 
I loved just about everything in this film. 

The performances were amazing, Jackman gives one of the best of his life, if not the best. Even Dafne Keen was refreshingly great for a child.

I even got teary-eyed at the end. The fight scenes were amazing and brutal. And Jackman couldn't have found a better ending for his defining role than this. 

10/10 for me. [deleted] Best compliment I can give, beyond credit to the three lead actors, is that it was first non MCU movie to really justify a non Disney company producing a Marvel film.

Disney never would have made this. It was so grown up. Not the violence or language but the themes and the raw emotion. Xaivers life work was pretty much for nothing. Mutants were outcasted and a divide between them and humans was apparent throughout his life, and it had only increased by the time he died. 

Essentially he should have joined Magneto and taken over the world.  Terrific movie. Not even terrific superhero movie. Just terrific from a dramatic perspective alone. This franchise started off with leather jumpsuits and a climax on top of The Statue of Liberty to prevent the assassination of every world leader with a defective mutation machine and look at where it's taken us. The last of the X-men, saying goodbye in a forest in the middle of nowhere, fighting to save a kid. Damn respectable ending.

I think we all need to appreciate Hugh Jackman for sticking with this role over the years. 17 years he's been Wolverine. To put that in perspective, if Christopher Reeve had done the same, his last Superman movie would've been in 1995. Michael Keaton's last Batman would've been in 2006. And Tobey Maguire would still be Spider-man. One of the most dynamic aspects of this movie that doesn't get enough mention is Xavier-Laura. Everyone loves the Father-Daughter duo with Wolvie-X23 but I think such an underrated aspect to Laura's maturation and trust to Logan is Xavier.  Xavier is the bridge to Logan. Logan is the bridge to Laura. Laura the bridge to her friends. 

The discovery of Laura gave a jolt of life and strength Xavier. When he tells Logan about her Logan thinks he's just being delusional. When we first meet her he's in his wheelchair inviting her in. From here we see Laura grow very fond of Xavier very quickly. When Logan is driving off in the limo and the Reavers are shooting at the back, Laura literally moves Xavier out of the way in front of her body to shield him from the bullets. We also see Xavier defend her every instance. When Laura's curiosity peaks at the outfit in the glass, it's Xavier that tells Logan to buy it for her. When Laura starts pressing buttons on the elevator, Logan gets pissed and Xavier reminds her she's just a child. When Logan stops Charles' seizure at the hotel, the first thing Laura does after finishing off one of the Reavers on the ground, she immediately goes to hold Charles' hand. When they're on the interstate and she's locking and unlocking the door, Logan gets mad and once again Charles defends her. Charles told her that Logan wanted to kill himself and told her to not let him. When Charles gets impaled by X24 we immediately see Laura go on the attack to protect him. When Xavier is dead in the back of the pickup, Laura's reaction (Dafne's acting) was absolutely perfect. She had just lost an influential father figure she never had. Someone that not only understood her, but embraced her and had compassion for her past. 
  
***This to me just showed that Charles Xavier's most talented gift all along wasn't his psychic abilities, it was his compassion and care for fellow man and mutant.*** The way he immediately becomes a grandfather figure/best friend to Laura, showing her they can be trusted is exactly what brought him back out of his depression and makes him feel whole again. That he can help another mutant that needs guidance. When Logan tells Charles the coordinates are from a comic book and aren't real, Charles tells him it's real to her. When Logan brings up Charles running a school, you can see how much it brings life and happiness back into Charles talking about it. Charles was one thing Laura and Logan had in common, and his death ends up bringing them together.

Edit: Not sure how I forgot this, but Laura and Xavier were both watching Shane when Xavier opened up to her about first seeing it when he was her age. It ends up being the speech Laura gives at Logan's burial! Thank you Hugh Jackman. You were the Wolverine to me and you can never be replaced. What a farewell to a character where Jackman made his own. [deleted] Wow. That was everything I hoped it would be. A truly beautiful and fitting ending to Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's chapters in the series - I'm still coming to terms that this is it after 17 years. I don't think I took a breath in the last 45 minutes. I hope they continue along the trend of more rated R movies like this and don't why from the intensity. It wouldn't have had the emotional impact on me that it did otherwise. Fuck, I need a drink. 

Thanks for everything Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. You were a huge part of my childhood cinematic experience. I'm sure this has been said countless times in here already, but Dafne Keen was absolutely phenomenal. Really hope she is able to reprise her role in some way, shape, or form.  A+ flick. Best X men movie by a mile. Need to see it again asap.  I literally yelled in surprise when X-24 killed Xavier. For a split second I thought it was a dream sequence, and then nope, that's a real clone.

God that scene fucked me up.  Everyone nailed how much this story rips out your heart and holds it in front of your eyes...

But one thing I don't see being mentioned much is how fucking badass and brutal Laura's introduction as X23 was. 

She's just sitting there, eating her corn flakes with 0 worry about the soldiers moving in on her....

Then you just hear the banging, gun shot...

And she strolls out and rolls his fucking head on the ground. Holy fuck that was amazing Looking through this discussion thread, did everyone not get the scene with Deadpool at the beginning of the movie? It seems to me like some people theaters didn't even show him in a pre-movie scene. Btw did I miss Stan Lee or did he sit this one out? That final shot may be one of my favorite endings of all time. 

I was already crying as she gave the speech from earlier in the movie (Which is when I realize he was going to die. It was wonderful foreshadowing)... But when she turned that cross into an X, I can't describe the feeling that hit my gut. One of the saddest endings I've ever seen. Can we take a moment to recognize [Boyd Holbrook](http://68.media.tumblr.com/92569b79f296f6130014c57a6dbf2d7b/tumblr_om5zzzO0T51ru4nfjo2_500.jpg) in this movie? He was phenomenal. One of the coolest and greasiest villains I've seen on screen. Loved every moment he was on screen I watched a review on youtube that was the bbc and the reviewer (Cant remember his name) made a good point. Logan talks about how the comics are too cheerful and in real life it was much more brutal. It is almost like the previous non-R rated Xmen movies are the comics, and this movie was the real thing, showed the brutality of the actual fighting and repercussions of being at war your whole life. Watching the chubby kid run in the forest was so funny.  During the burial scene, I feel like the kids were a metaphor for the audience and fans. Not only were we saying goodbye to Logan, but the kid with the Wolverine toy was me. Remember, Laura and the other kids read the X-Men comics. So they looked up to Wolverine and the X-Men like heroes like we do our heroes. To them it's real to us it's just fiction. They never got to see the X-Men, only heard and were told about them and read about them in a comic. The only and last thing they'll ever have seen about the X-Men was one of their idols rescuing them, running in the woods at 100mph and sacrificing himself for them. That's a legend that will live on in Mutant Folklore and whatever mutants remain in Canada with them. I mean when X24 got out of the tank, the kids saw Wolverine stumbling and could barely stand tell them ""Go, Go, Go now. Hurry"" The most depressing part of the movie for me is the fact that Charles and Logan are both buried in basically unmarked graves in the middle of nowhere Did I just tear up during an xmen movie? Jesus that was an amazing movie. That's up there with the best of superhero movies. It really blew away all my expectations  I don't think anyone can fill Jackman's shoes.  Or Stewart's.  Amazing performances.  And that Deadpool teaser was top notch.   Everyone here talking about Professor X and Logan, and I'm here like ""RIP Caliban"" [How cool that Logan died on the US/Canada border. His two homes.](#spoiler) I'm not going to cry. I'm not going to cry. I'm not going to cry. 

""Daddy.""

FUCK.  In the very first scene when Logan starts fighting those guys outside of his car... Just the way he attacked them, I knew this was going to be a new type of superhero movie, and I wasn't disappointed. Good lord, this is how Wolverine should be, and X-23 as well. A masterstroke. This quote by Mangold sums up why I'm so glad this was allowed to be rated-R.

""For me, what was most interesting in getting the studio to O.K. an R rating was something entirely different. They suddenly let go of the expectation that this film is going to play for children. And when they let go of that, you are free in a myriad of ways. The scenes can be longer. Ideas being explored in dialogue or otherwise can be more sophisticated. Storytelling pace can be more poetic and less built like attention-span-deficit theater."" 

I love how grown up this movie is. Not ""grown up"" the way kids think of it (violence, language and tits) but mature themes [deleted] These movies just hate hospitable farmers don't they? I find myself coming back to this thread again and again, because it's been an entire day and I still can't help but think about the movie. 

Man, I think that generally speaking this is one of the most sharply directed movies ever. So many movies out there today suffer from tonal inconsistencies, forget comic book movies, and yet it feels that James Mangold knew EXACTLY, but seriously EXACTLY what he wanted, and how to do it, and so it all came together so passionately, and profoundly too. 

It's really not to be taken for granted that we got such a mature, serious, and dark Wolverine movie.

It needed the R movie not for the curse words, the gore, or that brief boob flash, but for the darkness of the story.

To be honest, it made me feel uneasy, and I'm a fan of dark stories. I like it when people have a vision to make something ""fucked up"" and to not suger coat it.

I just wasn't expecting it from this.

I was expecting some scenes to get me in the ""feels"", but not to the extent this movie reached. Truly difficult stuff, I really mean this. 

Everything from Charles dying just after pouring his heart out, or the way Logan ran to him, him freaking out and nearly breaking down when he buried him..

Or generally the whole premise, both of them being old, broken men, who did so much good in this world only to eat so much badness.

To summarize what makes this movie so good in my opinion, let's talk about the final shot. Laura turning the cross into an X, and Logan.. staying dead. No final surprises. Takes a whole bunch of balls to do that, even considering Jackman left the role. They could have taken an alternative road, or maybe left it a little open for the sake of optimism, but no, they kept it pure dark, to the end.

Logan died happy, saying ""This is what it feels like"" (which totally destroyed me as well, btw), but all in all he had a terrible life with a bad ending, losing Charles. But Laura guided him, so at least he had some bliss.

Point is, fantastic movie.

I'm more of a DC guy, and BVS has been my favorite CBM for a while, but Logan has now taken the throne. Terrific stuff, really.

Well done to all the people who worked on it! There was a kid sitting behind me who couldn't have been older than 8 that said ""WOAH!"" when the woman in the bridal party flashed Logan I like how they casually mention tigers have gone  extinct.  You know how I know I am an adult? It's not all the bills I pay, it's not the career I have, it's not the apartment I moved into several months ago, it's not the engagement ring I bought, it's not the bachelor's degree hanging on my wall, it's not the sheer responsibility that I have that sometimes seems debilitating. No it's watching a hero you've known since you were a child, who was indestructible, limp, wheeze, bleed, cry, and become so very destructible. It was realizing that Wolverine just fucking died in front of my eyes... So this is what it feels like... The X-men films have had a lot of variation in quality from the great all the way to trash, and everything in between, however they have never really had a truly fantastic film, well until now. [Logan](https://tldrmoviereviews.com/2017/03/03/movie-review-logan/) is (well for me) the best film in the franchise by a country mile, the characters were relatable, the action was intense, the story was well structured, the pacing was just right, and it had emotional weight.

The action also felt contextual, and never gratuitous, so it makes the most out of the R rating without being defined by it. This is important because the R rating is not just an excuse, it is needed to tell the story they wanted to tell.    

I highly recommend Logan, you really should go see it. 
 I really hope Dafne Keene goes places after this. IMHO she gave one of the best child performances in the last 5-10 years. When she scremed ""Daddy"" my heart just broke...

Pretty much loved this 100%. Loved loved loved this sendoff. Stewart and Jackman killed it The ""speech"" Professor X gave before he died broke my heart. I don't think I cried that hard in a superhero movie before.  Xavier's confession killed me, the fact he figured out what he did followed by the fact he managed to opened up and confess to the wrong person killed me. 

The story was great but it was the performances that amazed me with this film.   I loved the movie and the discussion here I pretty much agree with the general vibe. However, no one is talking about the scientist kill. No long buildup or bullshit leading up to it just pop right in the dome and he's gone. One of my favorite kills in the movie. Every time Laura gave out a feral scream I got goosebumps. They really did her character well.


Damn, that family really got screwed for helping them out. Dammit, Charles.  When Professor Xavier asks Logan ""Does she remind you of anyone?"", referring to Laura, I immediately thought she looked like Famke Janssen's Jean Grey. Their facial features seemed strikingly similar, especially the cheekbones.  And her calm, yet furious, demeanor seemed so familiar. 

So the whole time I assumed X-23 was the genetic creation using both Wolverine and Phoenix, as her mother and father. I was waiting for a climax where she realized her mind control powers but alas, not to be. Still a fantastic end of an era.  This movie took me to unexpected places. There were several moments when the dynamic between Logan and Xavier very much reminded me of me and my old man toward his end. I would be focused on what makes sense, what is logical, and he would occasionally insist on something, seemingly at random, and it was only later that he said, heartbreakingly, that he just wanted something nice. For example, one day he had his barber come to our house. He was too sick to go out. He didn't exactly need a haircut, and neither did I, so when he offered me to sit down next to him and get a haircut too, I said I didn't need one, I didn't want to impose and make the sweet old lady cut another head of hair, she was doing this on her own time. Really though, I was struggling mightily with my dad's sudden downturn, so I went up to my room. When I saw my dad later, he looked hollowed out. He apologized — for what, I don't know. He said that we went to the barber together for my first haircut, and he had his hair cut in the chair next to me; he wanted me to share in his last haircut. A father-son thing coming full circle. Just a pretty little moment that meant more than a haircut should. I was so logical and cold and intent on keeping all that horrible shit at arm's length that it never occurred to me that there was the potential and need for something beautiful.

I saw my father in Xavier when he stopped everyone on the highway so he could calm those horses, or when he talked about just having that one nice dinner in a loving home. Simple things you are rarely conscious of cherishing until very special times in your life, frequently at the end of it.

I zoned out several times in the theater. I receded into memories of my dying father, and of my dying mother, what they said and did in their final weeks. They would be pissed off that they were in pain and couldn't even use the bathroom like a normal person. They were endlessly apologetic. But then they'd occasionally be stubborn, and I'd be so emotionally spent that I had a hard time dealing with special requests. I couldn't quite wrap my head around them. I wasn't on the run from lethal forces of evil, so I indulged them without a problem (such as suddenly being asked to take a wrong turn so that we could go the long way home... on a very pretty road through a forest... ""Oh, and over there, isn't that where that 5th grade friend of yours lived?""), but it would take me a bit too long to appreciate what they actually wanted: just something _nice_. 

Oh, and what was my dad's favorite movie? 

It was Shane. He quoted it often.
 I watched Logan 24 hours ago. I have so many thoughts and questions.


* Does Wolverine admitting to killing Xander Rice’s father officially put this in the “Apocalypse Timeline”?

* How old is X-24? Surely if he is a clone like Laura, he too had to grow up? Because he looks like Wolverine when he was at least 30. But, he was made after Laura, because she is X-23…?

* No post-credit scene seemed nice. It keeps us just talking and buzzing about “Logan”, rather than buzzing about a teaser for the next movie. Although people seem to be talking about the lack of post-credit scene, so it’s a moo point.

* I think people are going to get confused when the New Mutants movie gets made and none of the kids at Eden are in it. Prof. X mentioned the words “new mutants” several times during his plea to Logan about the telepathy with other mutants.

* I wish Gabriella were named Sarah. Also, have it hinted that Laura was forced to murder her at the hotel too. It would’ve been a nice touch. 

* Did Prof. X kill the last remaining X-Men or did Wolverine? ^^^I ^^^feel ^^^I ^^^missed ^^^something

* I think the samurai sword on the wall hinted that Logan did end up in Japan, despite DOFP. Again referencing the “ripple effect” Beast mentions in previous films. 

* Were those comics in the movie real?

* I liked the adamantium bullet. I thought it was a nice way to reference Origins in Logan. 

* I was ready for the rock to move a little at the end. Nope. He was really dead. ;(

* The only thing that can kill Wolverine is Wolverine. Well he did want to kill himself, after all. 
I'll add more as I think of them.  I want to mention that as an X-Men comics fan I loved the little things in this film...for example, the X-Men specific Marvel logo, Pierce saying ""Wolvie"" and ""Mutie"", Logan calling Xavier ""Chuck"" etc. There's a lot more and I def need another viewing. Great experience! It's also pretty sad that as soon as x-24 entered the room, Charles started talking to him as Logan.

But earlier in the film when Logan enters the water tower, Charles asks him who he is and says ""I always know it's you, I just don't recognize you.""

So it's as if Charles' still has that fresh faced young Logan in his mind, rather than the old, limping, gruff faced Logan of today. Which, if you've had someone in your family with dementia, that hits extremely hard. That is a bummer but I was glad Wolverine managed to get to him in time to say ""it wasn't me""  That would have been a really shitty end for Charles. Well I hope he appreciated it cos his insistence on having it got him and that whole family killed.  Logan carrying out of the house muttering 'It wasn't me, it wasn't me' was painful - knowing his only ally left died thinking it was him that killed him... Shit When real logan says ""it wasn't me Charles"" to him before he dies made my insides twist and my heart sink.  So true.  But that X-23 leap over his back was pretty fucking awesome too lol. [deleted] The sick part of that is more than likely caused by the adamantium poisoning, it's even referenced in the film. 

In X-Men #25, when Wolverines adamantium get's ripped out by Magneto, his healing factor subsequently improves, so it's implied that his healing factor is constantly fighting the adamantium poisoning. 

So I think in Logan it's just gotten to the point where his long exposure to it has pretty much worn down his healing ability.

Then him being suicidal is, as you've said, the mental strain of being alive for nearly 200 years and all the terrible shit that has happened to him during that time. Her punching him in the face was such a great little character moment  [deleted] When he asked her why she hadn't spoken she said something like: ""your always screaming at me and pushing me around and telling me what to do"" in spanish It's true, I don't think I've ever seen that either. And I absolutely loved it. But then using it as a weapon to take down the motorcycles was awesome. fences are stronger in the near future That sunsequent scenes approached *Fury Road* levels of visceral car weilded violence. When I saw that happen, the car seemed like such a perfect metaphor for Logan. How he is now.  Just a old, weathered version of his former self. Trying to push through one last time. I was also really high during this movie.  I like to think that Magneto is still alive and is one of the people waiting for X-23 and the other children across the border in Canada.  Magneto could sort this entire timeline's mess out. He is the only mutant capable of extracting the adamantium from Logan's body, making him healthy again. He would also be capable of leading a counter offensive against whatever was stopping the birth of random mutants. Magneto can fix everything, honey badger don't give a fuck.  I think that's one of the stronger points of the film that some people can just reflect on. As sad as it is, the ""villain,"" who was pretty much a product of the world's crimes against him and his family, wasn't really wrong, but he was still a threat. It really depends on how you look at him, though, because while he's certainly an antagonist, he's not entirely to blame. Still, the whole sad thing is that Logan's just struggling to get by as a limo driver of all jobs to get money to buy a boat and sail out to sea with his only two mutants that he can call a family. The way he struggles to help Xavier run away with him, even going as far as to fold and pack his wheelchair in the middle of danger, just emphasize somewhat of a father-son bond between the two, which we really didn't see. That dinner scene emphasized it. I guess after the ending, you realize it wasn't what you'd expect from a comic book superhero movie, at all. There's no saving the world; it's just a man trying to save what little family he has left while struggling with his past catching up to him. Getting a boat wasn't going to solve any of their problems, as Caliban stated in the beginning, but it's all Logan could do. In the end, we see that the heroes *did* kill the enemies, but the end is still unclear. Xavier died, pretty much all the mutants are dying out, Caliban sacrificed himself, and even Logan finally met his end. Arguably one of the strongest X-Men, he finally died, and it wasn't to change all humanity or really make the future better. All he did was save the one world that actually meant to him at death; Laura. While their future is unclear at his death, that's the end of his legacy. Logan did all he did up until the very end, and he can finally be at peace knowing he won't have to mourn for anyone, anymore, and that it's his turn to be mourned. Lol. Finally, in the end, he's vindicated. He'd have torn these fuckers limb from artificial limb. Yeah it was kind of a great irony that the future they avoided in *Days of Future Past* was probably a better end for Charles than what happened in this film. I.e. dying in a cool Tibetan mountain temple fighting off Sentinels to save the world vs. dying almost senile and crippled thinking that your old friend killed you. As someone else pointed out, all these depressing future scenarios (where mutants have it bad) in X-Men usually involve Magneto dying in order for it to happen. I thought this was great too. It always frustrates me when movies go way too far in their assumptions about the near future. They were all reasonable assumptions and they didn't go overboard trying to wave them in your face.   also  there was a lot of political digs in the film. i mean its literally about a mexican illegal immigrant effectively raised in a detention center and being treated like shit trying to get through the border and america for freedom in canada. Also the design of the limo wasn't some crazy future car bullshit. It looked like something you could see on the road in a few years.  > tigers are extinct

Did they say ""tiger"" or ""sabertooth tiger""?

I thought they said ""sabertooth tiger"" as a nod... 

 Mass consumption of corn syrup is pretty much the present... I was kinda bummed out when she didn't speak, but when she finally did, it made an already great performance even better. Holy shit! this is about as surprising as ""drink to the lady in the white/wyatt dress"" (westworld) Dude young Wolverine was terrifying jesus, full on animal Logan is a fucking monster I loved it. Imagine how unbelievably terrifying that would be for that last guy. A giant man with claws is slaughtering all your friends right in front of you, and you know you're next, but you can't move. He inches towards you till BOOM, blades to the face. Tonight, I found out about a nightmare I never knew I had.  Great scene, but how come the people didn't collapse the moment Logan stabbed them? Surely Charles couldn't control their brains after they've had metal claws shoved through em And despite that preview of things to come, some people still had their small children in the theatre where I saw the movie. Yup. He's spent his whole life fighting for mutant rights and coexistence, only to become one of the most dangerous of them all. Sad stuff  When the news report said it was just like an attack that killed mutants at the location of the X-Men mansion (all the X-Men) then his speech on ""I don't deserve this beautiful day"": that was gut wrenching and still only the second saddest scene.       The moment he realizes he was the one at fault of killing the majority of the School of mutants and boom x24 stabs hims. Haunting.  For me it's when he was saying how it had been the perfect night and he didn't deserve it. It's also the fact that he learned to accept others loving him. As a part of the xmen, the other xmen definitely had a family type connection to him, but he didn't let himself feel that for them. Famous american monument didn't get destroyed. Literally unwatchable. no sky beam 0/10 Because the consequences are real. The Dark Knight could have blown up those boats. Deadpool could have lost Vanessa. When you have to save the world, you already know they will succeed.  Whoever saves one life saves the world entire. I'm kinda torn on the whole who killed the x men. I really wanted the comic version. But this way definitely worked for the story.  Wait missed the spoiler part. Where did you get the from? had demented grandfather, he really reminded me of him, great performance !! Dude, her screams alone sold me on her as an actor and X23 as a character. They were brutal and made the fight scenes feel raw and frantic. You really felt like you were watching someone on a rampage rather than an actor following a script.  That was horrid and unpleasant but it raised the stakes. No one was safe. I think that's probably why they did it so early on because I don't think we see her so violently hurt again, but once you lead with that as an audience you really fear for these characters. 

I was tense throughout the entire film and didn't fully unclench until the credits rolled. In a way it was perhaps too intense because I was so wracked with anxiety over what might happened to the characters that I couldn't let myself fully feel the emotional beats. Let your guard down for a second and someone is unexpectedly stabbed  [deleted] There's a few parts that hit me, Many in the end.  But when she starts crying for him Daddy, oh man.  That ripped at me.  And The Cross turn, before she left.  Honestly, out of all the emotional gut punches in this movie, the one that makes me still tear up is picturing Logan crying saying, ""There's water..."" and not being able to go on. Whew.  When I saw X24 standing over Xavier I genuinely thought he was just having a nightmare. Then the scene continued and I was just like 'fuck.....' Once Charles passes away, Logan would kill himself with the adamantium bullet. Depressing shit. Wtf is this this mysterious deadpool opening that only exists in the US for some reason..   Surprised me when she spoke Spanish. She was awesome. [deleted] Fun fact: Hugh said he actually had people hold him down to make it seem more real. He was actually struggling against the force of something else. I can believe this. I've not worked on a Hugh Jackman film, but I've worked with people that have and I've heard that the guy is a fucking gent.  Buys the crew scratch cards on a friday, polite as hell, etc.  I hope this movie makes all the money just because Hugh Jackman seems so bloody nice!  Oh, and because it was excellent.  I think ""so this is what it feels like..."" was my favorite line, because it can easily be taken one of two ways.

Either this is what it feels like to have a family, or this is what it feels like to die. I left that movie and all I could think was...""an X-Men movie just made me cry.""

I think it definitely presents a challenger to The Dark Knight for best comic book movie of all time.  All three of the main actors did phenomenal jobs. It's no coincidence that Xaviers last words were sunseeker the name of the boat but also,

Son seeker.  Logan had always been his surrogate child and the one who had been with him the longest. That, but also just afterwards, when the fear turns to fucking RAGE and he just tears in to him... God damn it, what a movie! Only 200 years of battlefield experienced helped him hold his own...a bit.  [deleted] [Johnny Cash - The Man Comes Around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9IfHDi-2EA) I honestly thought they'd go with ""Hurt"" for the end credits. I was expecting to hear the opening cords when Laura adjusted the cross. Actually I felt the TV in the hotel was more of a top of the line/decent model now, but twelve years on is still the model used at a crappy hotel. Which is very accurate.  I'm so glad they didn't ruin it in the trailer  [deleted] Yea I definitely noticed that too. I also felt that they sort of pushed the idea that self driving cars are dangerous in the highway scene.  well they did reveal at the end that's how the doctor guy distributed the virus that wiped out all the mutants.  You know what, they should close the book on this franchise for like 5-6 years, then bring it back when [all the badass little kids in here come of age to star in movies. The REAL X-Men Evolution!](#spoiler) [deleted] I was taken aback by that sequence. And it's so fitting. This guy was glad for the help at the water pump, but it's their fault his whole family is dead. It was fantastic. I thought it Sabretooth!

When he killed ""Chuck"" I was like WOAH WHAT IS LOGAN DOING. But then when Logan faced him in the house the lighting made it look like Sabretooth. I wonder how intentional that was.  Most importantly, THANK YOU FOR NOT SHOWING IT IN THE TRAILER.

A shot of him looking menacing is *exactly* the kind of final shot I'd expect from a modern movie trailer.

BvS should've taken a leaf out of their book. People were going to go and see the movie anyway, and it seems the Logan team understood this. Second he said I'll get it back in the morning, I was like damn RIP kid. 2029 and no AirPods? That had to be the most depressingly beautiful movie I've ever seen. The child killing himself to escape the pain of being a weapon. The commentary about being gods mistake, and how mutants were just a blip in the human time-line. Watching mental illness leave Charles a shadow of his former self was too painful after losing my grandfather to alzheimers.  Knowing that he destroyed everything he worked for, the xmen, and not even of his own volition. Seeing an out of luck family succumbing to a changing world be torn apart in a conflict they didn't have any responsibility for.  All leading up to a devastating finale, that movie was a beautiful onslaught of brutality and sorrow. Jackman is Wolverine. I hope Fox retires the character for a long time.  I hope we get more R-rated movies in general. Not because I want gratuitous nudity or violence, but because I want the director to have that option if he feels it would improve the movie.

As for this movie, holy shit. Amazing. The R-rating finally allowed Wolverine to be what he's wanted to be for 17 years.

I remember thinking it would be amazing if someone could combine the storytelling of the MCU and the darker realism of the DCEU. And this was it. The Kid holding the Wolverine toy  was a nice touch too a beautiful moment  It was such a wonderful, simple touch. I needed the credits to make myself presentable before I left the cinema.  Yeah, that had the potential to be really cheesy (and I heard some people leaving the theater say just that) but I think it was pulled off well. Laura quoting the line from the movie she watched with Charles was the crack that broke the dam for me. 

Laura could finally grieve for the men who protected her, and the men and women who saved her. is that from the last wolverine movie? by my stars and garters... This is a made-up connection.  

She continues to say, ""it wasn't beating.""  

It's foreshadowing the scene where he removes the parasite from himself, meant to set up suspense/tension in that scene.  Heard so many people sucking teeth at that scene. how come he don't want me man That was more brutal than any of the kills. Also old man who looks like Logan and a little girl with a green backpack and an attitude problem.  Almost..? I was a faucet. I was sitting there looking at the rocks hoping one would budge. And as much as I would hate for them to do that, I would've been relieved that we'd see him as wolverine once more. Such a great way to end their run.  The sweetest moment was when Laura used the claws from her feet while defending Logan from X-24, Xavier said early on that females used this to defend their pack - front claws attach, feet to defend.

It was only there for a brief moment but that was the defining 'father/daughter' moment for me. https://i.imgur.com/AdiBPrO.jpg Don't wash your hands He's been wolverine for 17! Shit man there won't be another one for me  When Charles died I thought that was going to be the most tearful moment.

And then Laura called James ""Daddy."" I lost it just like I lost it during Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Buffy uttered ""Mommy.""

I feel heart broken over this film. I'm so glad it exists. We walked out like that to a whole crowd waiting in line for the 10pm movie.

Fuck.

Sorry guys. He was! The scene where ge gets burnt was very strong. I wish the main reaver died with him in the truck when he blew it up though, kind of felt like his death didn't really accomplish much with him surviving. It impresses me how well he can act. He always did well in his comedy parts and I just assumed it was because of his natural funniness, but this is the first time Ive seen him give a legitimately good acting performance. Hes a talented chap, considering also how well he writes. At least he got to remember it before he died... Yay. Also ties in with why they have to be in hiding and how his mind is classified as a weapon of mass destruction and rice is worried about the most dangerous mind having alzheimers or dementia. When the farm dude pointed his gun at Logan, and pulled the trigger. Idk why but it was so sad. The look on Logans eye like ""I'm so, so sorry. I deserve this."" yet there was no bullet in the chamber. He missed his chance at death. 

 had kids with parents while watching deadpool last year. seems to be a trend! [deleted] I thought he was in the movie at first.. I was so happy, even though it was only a teaser I did. I thought it was a great way to start the movie.  Also if you notice x-24 was wearing a black tank versus Logan's white. Just like in classic westerns, black hat versus white hat. > Also please please please can we just get X-23 in the normal X-Men continuity, I don't care if they don't explain it at all, I don't care if Deadpool and Cable just turn up and time travel her over, the timeline's fucked, at least take advantage of that and utilise one of the best castings ever as much as you can.

I assume that is exactly what is meant to happen. Deadpool and Cable will come across the girl and take her back in time to be under McAvoy's Xavier's care and maybe continue to try and prevent the timeline from happening.

The girl is going to show up in the rest of the series. She is too awesome of a character to not appear again.
 I still think he deserves an Oscar nomination..superhero movie or not. His acting was superb no doubt. Can we talk about Dafne Keen? She's only 11 years old and holy shit what amazing acting on her part. She barely talked in the film and yet she portrayed her character so amazingly well. ""Daddy"" killed me. IMO she should get something for that. I've never seen such good child acting. Yes I have seen the room.  Like how Charles talked about how Logan will be needed at the Statue of Liberty, then later revealing that Gabriella and Laura were waiting for him at the Liberty Motel. That family died in the saddest order possible.  Also, so refreshing seeing a positive example of a black family. Not gangbangers, not thugs. Father, in a way, killed his own family with his stubborn way of providing. Forcing his son to compete, not moving away etc. 
And the death................man like you said, the look of hopelessness. 
Favorite part of the movie, in an already magnum opus  That was symbolic.  He was everything they ever knew about their prison they were brought up in.  They all wanted to end him and leave behind that life.  The part there that destroyed me was Logan's frantic crying and saying ""It wasn't me, Charles it wasn't me"" I was reading about that online when I checked if there was a post credit scene. It seems like a lot of theaters didn't have it for some reason.
 I'm glad he didn't have a cameo. Same reason I'm glad there wasn't any post credit stuff. Wouldn't have fit the tone of what they were doing with the film. Like The Dark Knight trilogy, it was less a superhero movie and more a movie with superheroes.  He was so smooth, in a southern white trash sort of way. I think Prof X did it, it kind of implied it when he says he did something bad but he can't remember. And it makes sense because him killing all of the x men would be reason to call his brain a weapon of mass distruction I can answer the comics question. They commissioned an artist (I forget which one) to draw those up for this movie. They aren't real-world X-Men comics.  On your second point it sounds like X24 was cloned to that point in a short time, because the scientist says he is brand new when he's fixing him. 

About who killed the mutants I believe it was Xavier because he says he finally remembered Westchester when he's lying in bed. And that he understands why Logan was drugging him and hiding him. Sounded he had his first seizure there.  X-24 looked like he was built limb by limb. They showed random arms and legs in tanks as Gabriella was saying they found a better option than the kids.  

I read an article that there was a stinger at the end...waited to see and and only because I read that one was filmed, I was mad that there wasn't one.  If they said, hey, no stinger, I would be fine with that.  

Not only the samurai sword on the wall, but that whole compound they were living in was property of Mariko's steel company, they mentioned it when confronting Logan.  

 > I feel I missed something

You didn't miss anything, they purposefully left that vague. It seems that Charles killed many of them during his first seizure. 

>I think the samurai sword on the wall hinted that Logan did end up in Japan

He still served in WWII, regardless of if the main plot of The Wolverine happened. And the character is also a huge weeb.  God damnit, this movie was sad enough already without this :( i broke down during both of those scenes. I lost my grandmother to Alzheimers and it was like that, she knew who i was but just couldnt recognize me, but when she saw a picture or video from when i was younger she recognized me. Also, a young Xavier would've instantly heard X-24's thoughts and known it wasn't really Logan :( I think we all freeze ourselves/others at a certain age. My grandmother used to look in the mirror and say, ""who is this old woman looking at me?"" No dementia. Her mental picture of herself was around 30. 

 Yo, Stop. I never really recovered from Xavier's death... ""it wasn't me"" [bro...](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/crying-man.gif)

So when X24 showed up the 2nd time and Logans syrum had worn out I knew it was coming, fuck did that hurt. I was already falling apart when they buried him... then that little black kid had to be holding a Wolverine action figure... [BRO!!](http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Matthew-McConaughey-Crying.gif) My mother had a form of dementia (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy) and this movie hit home during the Charles scenes. There were days when she could remember everything about me and days when she barely recognized me. I was really overweight growing up, but had lost it during her sickness. So, about once a week, she'd say I was ""too skinny"" to be her son. That line Charles said to Logan was honestly a little too hard for me to hear. I was also with her when she died and watching Laura tear up and say ""daddy"" at the end was also very powerful. 

I will admit that I'm not the biggest X-Men fan. Don't get me wrong, I have a ton of respect for it, but I guess I never got into it as a child and now there's so much out there, it's kinda hard to pick new things up. That being said, I thought this movie was fantastic and I intend on going back and watching all of the movies so I can fully appreciate this movie. 

I'm very glad I didn't miss this one.  Honestly, I thought that was a dream sequence until he also killed the family :( That was a masterful touch. It's a simple line, but the tone and the moment and the urgency, in the middle of the chaos, how he takes a second to let him know that he didn't do it.  Really my only complaint about the film.  WHY would any of them think it's a good idea to stop & have dinner with this family when they know people are still after them?  And they even decide to spend the night!

Also it was kind of comical when the scientist at the end was shouting ""don't let them get to the border!""  He put mutants on the brink of extinction, cloned kids in Mexico, sent a killer into a family home...but he will NOT cross into Canada illegally. Well we have here a half-empty/half-full situation, don't we.  I think Logan knew that would be a danger too, but Chuck was so exhausted and lonely from spending a year in a metal box on drugs that he desperately wanted a feeling of family again. When he said he didn't deserve it because of what he had done, it alluded to the fact that he had created the X-men school. He wanted that sense of family and brought the mutants together, only to bring them to danger and actually being the reason for their deaths. The death of the family that hosted them is like an allegory for what happened to the mutant family he had built. That girl is terrifying.  Yeah if we follow the movie lore (and that's one painful piece of lore that came from X-Men Origins: Wolverine), the adamantine bullet by itself won't kill him, only remove his memories, but with his healing factor is deteriorating, that would have been a viable suicide method. It was such a low-key punch too lmao like it's something people regularly do Lol as nuanced as the film was, I love how basically only in a comic book movie can punching someone in the face be considered a ""little character moment."" *""Alright we'll go to fuckin' Fantasyland...""* Reminds me of the ending of the Jerry Lewis film *The Bellboy*.

>How come you've never talked?

>Nobody ever asked me anything. As a non-Spanish speaker, I *really* enjoyed the lack of subtitles. Truly. It really helped to keep up with Logan's experience, as opposed to giving the audience a hookup while Logan sits around frustrated. Fuck yes. Imagine being that guy trapped in the barbed wire then slammed into a wall. Fuck That would be Department H and Alpha Flight. Wendigo was standing in the trees watching in that last scene... Dude, I thought they were going to be able to cross the border and they'd be like ""Eden!"" and then cue Ian McKellen as old & frail Magneto appearing before them: 

**""Eden? No, children. Welcome... to GENOSHA.""**

BOOM.   Well the modified corn to make the corn syrup in all the drinks preventing mutant births is going to be hard to stop. I suppose stopping the farming and processing plants as well as world wide exposure of the information to everyone would help.  Even sadder when you think about how the boat plan was basically a murder/suicide. > sail out to sea with his only two mutants that he can call a family.

No he was going to leave kaliban behind actually.  The idea was to bring the professor out where he couldn't kill anyone like he did when he killed the xmen in westchester.  Then after the professor died at sea, logan would shoot himself. i think the boat thing was to maybe let charles rage out in the water until he died or logan kills him and then kills himself Oh yeah, it never occurred to me that humans could freely use metal enhancements with no Magneto around.  It's sad that the extinction of the tiger is a reasonable assumption for the future.  That wasn't nearly as much of a political dig when they were filming as it is now, though, heh. And killing a guy named Donald at the end of the movie. ""De nada."" I'm simply amazed at those fight scenes. Executed so flawlessly I nearly believed they had two Hugh Jackmans. He looked like a bit of a cross between Hugh Jackman's normal wolverine look and Liev Schreiber's Sabertooth. Really animal looking and scary. Perfect way to show his internal battle too. The constant fight between Logan and the Wolverine [deleted] I mean, you should be kind of aware of the risks when you accept employment in a paramilitary squad tasked with capturing an exceedingly dangerous child protected by two of the world's most powerful (albeit aging) mutants...  > A giant man with claws

The funny part is that Wolverine is 5'3"" (160cm) in the comics, and the early X-Men films had him shot at angles to make him appear smaller.  Later on they just stopped caring and started using Hugh Jackman's natural height, 6'2"" (188cm). It is possible in his seizure, Charles hijacked their entire nervous systems. I saw it as more of a telekinetic thing, where everyone was just being held in place with the force of Xavier's power.  The way the guy outside the door looked at Logan made me think that he was in control of his mind but just couldn't physically move to stop him. It was fucking heartbreaking watching his character, but Stewert played it amazingly. It's a fantastic premise as well, the most powerful brain in the world with a neurological disorder. When he was talking to ""logan"" and tearing up about what he did in Westchester. My god man I actually shed a tear. He really sold that shit  I didn't understand that part.  Was Professor responsible for the mutants dying off? Welp, that flew right past me. :<

Didn't realize that the mansion was located in Westchester :< Also Wolverine "" It wasn't me Charles, it wasn't me"" Over and over. I was watching this film through watery eyes :( Instead, they took a canadian one ;c We did get mostly a faceless army so 4/10. Oh man when they had dinner with the family I just knew bad shit was gonna happen. Didn't make the fall out any easier to watch. Tropes can be over done and seen a mile away but if they're done right, its so satisfying. [deleted] That is the reason I have a soft spot for Terminator 3. They subverted the 'saving the world' storyline by failing to. I saw that movie when it came out and I gobsmacked by the ending as the missiles flew. What happened in the comics? When exactly did they reveal that Charles killed the X-Men in the Westchester incident?

I picked up that people died due to Charles' loss of control in Westchester from the radio scene and Charles' lines in bed, but I thought they just said a bunch of civilians were hurt, not anything specific about the X-Men. Charles' first seizure took place in Westchester, in the X-mansion itself. With the exception of Logan, he killed the X-men, the students, and even people in the surrounding area. That's why robot-hand called him ""America's most wanted octogenarian"" at the start, and it's why Logan is hiding him in Mexico.

There are two allusions to the event. Once on the radio in the car, where the the incident in the hotel is being discussed. They compare it to a previous event in Westchester that killed many people, including seven X-men. Logan turns the radio off. 

The second is just before Charles is murdered. He's just recalled the event, and that he killed all those people. That's why he's so miserable, and why he's saying he didn't deserve the happy day he'd just had. He realises that Logan was hiding that fact from him, so that he wouldn't feel guilty. Her screams and her staring daggers. Girl can fucking scowl. With their intensity, I really want to see a movie/show with her and Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven from Stranger Things) just fighting and being intense. What did he mean by ""there's water""? I think the main purpose behind Laura's eulogy is for her to acknowledge the line ""there are no more guns in the valley.""
 not to mention he might aim to fall off the boat and sink so no one could use his body as a weapon again The Old Man and the Sea. Wow. Again, this movie breaks my feelings very time I think more about it Seriously, the hell?? I saw it in Mexico and the beginning was him murdering a bunch of thugs.
 I figured she spoke Spanish. The nurse spoke Spanish to her. Was still a little surprising though but not because it was Spanish. To me at least. I actually whispered to my sister ""that's Deadpool"" as a joke when I saw the guy in the hoodie walking down the street. Was completely surprised when it turned out it was him. 

I think I may be a psychic.  TIL, I guess those people were dressed all in green? If so I *need* that unedited footage. You can lose an entire afternoon watching Hugh Jackman interviews on YouTube. He's so fucking nice and he has more charm than just about anyone I've ever seen. It's hard to imagine a more likeable guy, which makes it even more impressive that he's so convincing as Logan. I really felt it when Laura says ""there are no more guns in the valley"" 
Just hits a real tone for the movie  I think you could also take it as, ""So this is what it feels like to be the one dying, instead of the one mourning."" Just a great line.  I was telling my friend in the theater that it was so awesome they they setup manufactured rage vs real rage for that fight.  This is what I kept thinking. He's able to put up coz of his experience.  Yeah. Weirdly, all the violence in the move and that's the one that I really cringed on.  Ok, so I just got home from the movie, and it made me want to listen to Johnny Cash, and now, I'm listening through the entire album that both The Man Comes Around and Hurt were released on. It happens to also be Johnny Cash's last album that was released during his lifetime, and nearly all of the songs on it seem to be about death from the perspective of a man who knows he's dying, even if most of them are covers. 

But, in lieu of having an ""inspired by"" soundtrack for Logan, it fits very, very well, especially since it ends with Cash's cover of [""We'll Meet Again""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KodNFsP6r88), which fits very well since we all know that while Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart won't play these characters any more, we'll meet Wolverine and Professor X again. Yeah, Fox may suck at pg-13 superhero movies, but god damn have these two R-rated ones exceeded my already high expectations. I was really expecting them to reveal that they were hacked or something. [But mutant kind is effectively dead, isn't it? What would they be fighting for in the end?](#spoiler)  For a while, I briefly entertained the idea that they're setting these ""new mutant"" kids up as the next generation of x-men, and the they'd actually get to cross the border and find, not Eden per se, but Genosha, with Ian McKellen as old and frail Magneto welcoming them with open arms, seeing Wolverinee deliver them and tell him ""They're in your charge now."" BOOM. Wolverine and the New Mutants movie. 

And then I remembered this was Jackman's last film as Wolvie. :( And Logan accepted it. He wasn't trying to stop it or defend himself. He understood and just was lucky the gun had no more shots in it.  I guessed that ""X-24"" was going to be a clone of Logan, when they showed an adult man in the tub being experimented on and wouldn't show his face. When they showed him walking up to Charles in the house but didn't show his face it confirmed it for me.

I was hoping for a more epic fight between Logan and his clone instead of Logan getting his ass beaten completely twice but I understand the entire point of the movie was too show that these were the last days of Logan's life and he was trying to do something meaningful even though he wasn't the warrior he once was. This. So much this.  2029 and all the cars look like they're from 2005.  Aside from the Limo and the Trucks  Wouldn't mind seeing Dafne Keen take up the mantle, as Laura did in the comics. Only problem is that I like Logan as a standalone and don't want the heavy-handed exposition they'd have to link it to the rest of the Fox films. If they can bring her in while leaving her link to Logan ambiguous then I'm all for it.  ""It's an action figure!"" I identified with that kid so hard during that scene.  That and when she called Logan daddy...Damn that hit me harder than that train hit those red shirts. I think responses to the ending are going to fall into two firm camps. If you weren't invested by the time Logan woke up in North Dakota, everything afterwards was going to seem a bit cheesy. If you were invested by that point -- then damn, what a gorgeous conclusion. The Wolverine, yes. Does that mean like audibly cringing? Like a wince sound?

I've never heard that phrase before Not to mention:

* The male protagonist is a miserable, jaded survivor who has lost sight of any hope in the world

* A wounded woman tries to get the male protagonist to escort a girl with a mutation (who she raised) to a safe zone because the woman wasn't able to; the male protagonist initially refuses because it's too risky

* The male protagonist's friend constantly urges him to take on the girl

* The male protagonist's friend eventually gets killed as a result of the escort mission they picked up

* The male protagonist tries to resist getting attached to the girl because of his past; they eventually get attached anyway

* Meets a black family who helps them halfway through the story, but they all end up dead (really stretching with this one)

* The girl isn't an useless follower but actually contributes in taking out the people hunting them; she uses stealth, mounting, and copious amounts of stabbing to get the job done

* The male protagonist eventually becomes incapacitated, and the girl ends up taking care of them both. She gives him medication to help him recover.

* The male protagonist tries to leave the girl with a group of people, because he already fulfilled his duty taking her that far; the girl confronts this by bringing up the male protagonist's past

* After recovering from his wounds, the male protagonist pursues and unleashes hell on the girl's hunters, because he didn't want her captured and/or killed

The context is different, but there's definitely a lot of similarities. But we've never *had* hero deaths like these in comic book movies; instead our heroes are usually temporarily unavailable until the next movie. I was relieved the rocks never moved and we went straight to ""LOGAN"" and the credits. A straight ending, no ifs and buts. It is the perfect ending for Logan and Professor X. 

And even Caliban (who never grew on me) got his moment with 'watch out for the light!'. Pretty damn good for a side-character. [deleted] I don't see it mentioned anywhere in this thread but what about that first car chase scene where Laura wraps herself over Charles to keep him safe and her arm gets mauled with shattered glasses. That scene was heartbreakingly sweet... The moment I realized that Logan never heard what Charles said about ""the most perfect night"" destroyed me.  Ha, I thought about that too.

""These poor fuckers probably think the movie was either really terrible or really sad."" [deleted] No it was the completion of his arc. He starts out a bit whiny and not too bright. Passive, mostly reacting to events and then finally he gets to go out with 'watch out for the light...' That was a great ending for what really was a minor character in the movie. If you think that's sad, he got impaled by who he thought was Logan, and the real Logan kept saying ""It wasn't me..."" while trying to carry him out of there. It was so heartbreaking to hear Xavier say ""...our boat..."" as he's confused and just dying. Yeah, you could feel the regret and responsibility he felt bringing on the death of this innocent family. I think he really accepted his death at that moment. He accepted the shooting with zero anger.  It was touching.  They were there with their father who I overheard saying ""I looked it up online and it said it was PG-13, oh well too late now"". ""Shut up or I'll tell the staff that you're in here"" I was so pumped thinking he was going to play a small part in the actual film it left me kind of disappointed when i realized it was just a teaser.  Then I didn't care anymore once Logan stabbed that first dude under the chin and you could see the claws make ripples through the skin.  That was fucking rad. No. No fucking way. Unacceptable. She watched her father sacrifice himself for her and her friends, called him daddy, buried him...and then because REASONS she gets shoehorned into the McAvoy lineage which, make no mistake, contains a very real and alive Logan? 

No.  He deserves it, the Academy just don't care.  Can you imagine your first acting job acting across from Stewart and Jackman ? That would be so intimidating and she held her own. Very impressive.  Her acting when she was mute was astonishingly good.   See that's one I didn't pick up on at all. It may have seemed obvious to some, but it went completely over my head until you just mentioned it. Had it been spoonfed to me, i 100% would've picked up on it. As for the no post credits scene, someone in my screening said it was unsettling and I think they got it dead on. For a superhero movie to end on a black screen feels wrong these days and I thought it was a great idea to do that. Just ends. It's over, like Professor X and Wolverine. Plus we (some) got the Deadpool bit at the start. At the end it would have ruined the tone of the final scene.  Yep. X-23 was born and X-24 was grown. Same here. That whole sequence was horrifying. [deleted] Well we dont know the political situation of the time, so for the sake of giving the film the benefit of the doubt it can be assumed that crossing the border is a big deal. Simple. The nurse said that experimenting on Mutants were illegal. Transigen was off-the-books. If they crossed into Canada illegally, it might bring light to the whole thing that the US government is making their own WMDs in the form of ""Charles Xavier Jr."" and X-24. Which might bring down the US of A as entire nations band against them. Hell, even an NGO as powerful as Transgien would falter before the might of the Canadian military:

""These mutants're under our protection now, eh? No funny business now, or I'll have ta blow a hole in yer head there, eh? (Sorry.)"" I thought it really was tragic that he was responsible for the deaths of all the other X-Men.  You got that right. Man she fucking killed her role.  Yeah, that's the one piece of the film I'm unsure about. I mean, yes it obliterates X-24s adamantium skull, but a young Logan would be able to recover from that usually. 

However, I think it's maybe implied by the scene in which X-24 is impaled on the tractor and then needs the serum from Xander Rice to heal, that he doesn't have the same quality of healing factor that Logan and Laura have, so that could indeed finish him off.  >  world wide exposure

On that point and someone else in this thread mentioned it, is the HFCS is not really consumed outside the USA. In the end they were fleeing to Canada probably because it had a health human population.  Magneto would be the perfect candidate to do all these things though. He isn't just a powerful mutant, he also doesn't shy away from grand acts to get his point across. Crash a media event, crush a HFCS factory with his bare hands, whatever it takes. Magneto would do it.  ""Shouts at Logan in Spanish""

""SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!"" This is the thought that I keep coming back to: It really was astonishing how convincing the two Wolverine's were on screen. I was simply so immersed by the film and it's story that I never questioned how they pulled it off. It genuinely felt like they had two Hugh Jackmans to shoot with

Even right now, as I type this, I can't really recall any obvious digital face-mapping, or body swapping. Like, with the Young Arnold appearances in Terminator, it's pretty obvious. The audience is asked to buy it because we are supposed to. But this was obviously different, because they had the actor there who could physically portray both versions in-camera. Even knowing that, though, doesn't take away from how truly mind-blowing those fight scenes were! 

In fact, I can't really think of a comparable cinematic example to this that so effectively pulled off an epic battle where an actor fights himself so believably. To pull this off, the pre-production, shooting, and post-production teams all had to be completely on the same page, with no deviations from that original goal. To me, this is further evidence that there wasn't much ""corporate meddling"" behind the scenes, or at least as much as in the previous films.

The fact that FOX allowed this movie to happen, in all of its brilliance, is an accomplishment unto itself! They just used a double from The Prestige  The last moments when he thought he was talking to Logan. Damn. That was some first class acting.  Thing about the original x men movies is they had three classically trained phenomenal actors, two of which are in this film There is a new show on tv (FX) called Legion. Same premise.  What did he do though ? I was confused about that.  well on the radio before the highway horse scene, you hear it say something along the lines of ""Similar to an attack that happened westside that killed *seven(or several) of the X"" then logan turns it off. Just most of the X-Men. The evil scientist got the rest via something in the water or corn syrup I think.   Broke my heart man, In the Mark Millar comic its Logan that has to struggle with the grudge of him killing the entire school. After he realizes what he had done he attempts suicide. 

http://images.sequart.org/images/Wolverine-Old-Man-Logan-2008-Digital-TPB-Zone-Empire.cbr-Page-4-660x1001.jpg As is tradition. Mostly headless as well.  I actually really liked how they made the faceless mooks. Even though they were totally expendable plotwise, they all really looked like individual, tough people who had fought their way into the merc life. It made each kill really feel powerful.

Idk why but I just never got that feeling from faceless baddies before. thats why thy become tropes. they are effective, just overused.  Same. That movie had a lot of problems, but they got the ending right.  Wolverine killed them all. An illusion caused him to see them all as villains and he went to town. It was a subtle reveal at two points. 1st time is after the seizure at the hotel when the Reavers attack. There is a news story about it where the anchor woman says it was just like the incident in Westchester (home of the Xavier Institute). She says something like 600 people were paralyzed and many were left dead including 6 of the X... Then the TV is shut off. 

The 2nd time is when X-24 first shows up at the farmers house. Charles thinking it's Logan is having a rare moment of lucidity from his dementia. He recounts what he did and thanks Logan for protecting him from remembering it. Her eating the cornflakes sold me on her completely.  [deleted] [removed] And the text after the Deadpool video talks about that book. Holy crap. Holy shit. You just blew my mind dude Also, the Firefly posters behind Deadpool.  Who were some of the bad guys from that?

The Reavers. That's still the beginning of the movie, there was just a deadpool teaser before that. The thing about it is that when the teaser started, the lights dimmed, so everybody thought it was the actual start of the movie. It was pretty great.  And Xavier talked to her in Spanish I was assuming that she was mute and then when she spoke Spanish I just assumed she didn't bother speaking because she knew Logan wouldn't understand her.  The angry tirade of Spanish was absolutely perfect.  It was when she spoke English that I was surprised. please don't start having seizures  Maybe they were pulling him back on harnesses or something idk It hit me hardest when she turned around and turned the cross into an X.  The last X-Man.  ;_; More excellent lines:


""De nada""

""THE FUCK!?"" Yeah that part killed me. I just thought about Logan finally being at peace. I actually didn't think of your second point, and that just makes it even more heart wrenchingly beautiful.  I totally got the ""So this is what it feels like to be the one dying"" as well as the other possible elements of feeling at peace, or paternal feelings for his little girl, but ""instead of the one mourning"" adds extra punch and makes so much sense.

All his life he's had to be on the other side seeing his loved ones die, and never being on that end. So much weight and feels in that final statement.  I believe the bad guys mentioned they were modifying the food supply to eliminate mutant births.  Zander said the suppression of mutant births was and still is being engineered. They could take down the company poisoning world food supplies with mutant suppressants  The whole time I was thinking ""why are they putting this family in danger?"" I still don't really get it. >but I understand the entire point of the movie was too show that these were the last days of Logan's life and he was trying to do something meaningful even though he wasn't the warrior he once was.

Absolutely, though it made that brief moment towards the end so amazing when Wolverine in all his berserker rage fury was back. It was fleeting, intentionally, and wonderful as a result.  A lot of 2017 cars look like they're from 1993...  I have a feeling she'll be in Deadpool Fun fact: The United States Court of International Trade determined that for purposes of tariffs, Toy Biz's X-Men action figures were toys, not dolls, because they represented ""nonhuman creatures"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Biz,_Inc._v._United_States ""Don't be what they make you.""

""So that's what it feels like.""

Heartbroken. I think I need a rewatch to enjoy it. Fucking weirdos laughing and making comments really killed the mood.  You know when you pull a grimace and suck in your breath and it whistles through your teeth? Both stories start in Texas.  the ""I'm not whatever you think I am"" scene reminded me so much of the ""you're not my daughter, and I'm sure as hell ain't your dad"" scene I almost audibly said ""fuck me"".

I also hoped  [logan would survive impalement as joel did, but these were two different situations, especially when the camera shot the nasty wound in logan's stomach.](#spoiler) DO IT

We got our official (tragic) ending for our hero, but let's see Hugh Jackman leave on a high note.  Yeah I really enjoyed that moment.  It did a great job of showing her true character.  After seeing her brutally killing a bunch of guys, the audience might assume she is just a murder machine.  But, having her shield Xavier showed that she has a kind heart.  That was better character development in 5 seconds than some movies manage in their entire run. The part where Logan ran back to Charles to tell him that he didn't kill him got me more. I wanted to know more about him. He was an underground mutant broker in Apocalypse (same character, different actor), then went full on villain, helping the bad guys round up mutants, then he decided to help Logan and Charles, decided to sacrifice Laura for Charles, and when Charles died he was so upset he went suicide bomber. What was his story? What made him change sides so many times? What's his history with Logan and Charles?  I think the sadder thing is that Logan never heard the professors final speech about being happy. The last time Logan talked to X was when they argued and he stormed off 2nd innocent family, if we count the first Wolverine movie, though he might not remember that.  Lol that man def knew it was R. Nothing was stopping him from seeing Logan  This. 

""Don't be what they made you"" was a line for a reason. They should have included a mentally disabled character and set the film in 1940s Poland. She's only 11 though (probably 10 when she was filming?). She probably don't think of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart the same way most of us do. Great use of the R rating.  The scene could have been done well enough with a pg-13, but something about having to see the aftermath of an attack so brutal like that, especially after all of Logan's hesitation and warnings, just made the scene that much more. The whole farm scene felt like something out of a horror slasher flick, X-24 was fucking terrifying.    Yeah, it took me a moment to process what had just happened. Me too. I was literally thinking, ""psh here comes the cheap dream sequence trick"" and then the scene just kept going and going and with each passing second, it hit me harder and harder that it wasn't a hallucination/dream sequence until I was sitting there in horror that Prof X actually did just get stabbed and the poor kid and his family were brutally ended as well. Double plot twist, super well done. We also dont know who is going to meet them at the border. Could be scary people? We will likely never know It'd be a fucking crime if they don't do more with her in future films.  Yeah I could see them not giving the clone full regenerative abilities, to avoid another wolverine getting loose. When X-24 was impaled and Logan was still trying to get up, the long shot of Dr. Rice watching from the distance made it look like he was in awe that Logan was still able to get up at all. It almost seemed like he realized that X-24 would never be that good. It was almost a look of respect, knowing that he could never create what nature did.  Well they said it's not just corn syrup. It's even in shampoo and other consumer products.  *Theater full of people laughing* They aged Hugh up for one Logan and aged him down for the X24.

Contrast made them feel like totally different people. Great work by makeup dept With Young Wolverine, I kept getting Liev Schraber's Sabertooth feelings Wow, yeah, you're right about the immersion thing. I was so caught up in it that it didn't even occur to me that it was an impressive thing. It wasn't until I read your comment that I thought to question how they pulled it off.  Na they used 2, first clone died. Man, Christian Bale is great in *everything*. It was even sadder when Logan went up to him, saying ""It wasn't me... it wasn't me..."" just hoping that he could've at least heard and understood, before he died. It's really a shame that the Academy will likely not give out any acting awards out for this movie. Because both Jackman and Stewart's performances were just absolutely top notch. They gave such a huge amount of gravitas to their characters in this movie. Yeah, that's actually Xavier's son in the comics, but there's lot more reasoning behind that than just a neurological disorder, but I don't know if the show will go into it though. He had a seizure that killed the mutants in his school. I believe she said ""Westchester"" which I think is where the mutant school was located The corn syrup was for eliminating the mutant gene from being passed on so that's why there weren't any new mutants being born. Eliminating mutants was Caliban's old job I believe, the used him before to exterminate mutants.  Ehh. I like the idea of Xavier destroying what he built and Wolverine caring for him the whole time. It makes it much more sad that he ended the many lives of the people he gathered and quite honestly built the series around. It ties everything better. Just sitting there, watching them come in and not even tripping about it. She was great. Also fitting that Logan was buried beside some water. I expected Laura to say something like that, too. Holy shit, the tie-in with the Deadpool clip at the start. ""esta ... esta ...bien... es tren....choo choo... choo choo...""  [deleted] That was one gruesome scene in the hotel room. Those poor bastards couldn't do anything but watch as Logan walked up to them, and pierced them like shish kabobs. x-men became an x-man :(

i kept waiting for more, it ended too soon goddamnit. i want to know that x-23 and the kids are safe and that eden is real. instead it did that bittersweet unknown that children of men did That was when the dam finally broke completely for me. That final shot resulted in me needing to just take a second in the theater restroom to recompose myself, I felt like I'd lost a beloved uncle. Thank you so fucking much Hugh Jackman for all you've done for this character.  Also I love how he is immediately pissed she hasnt been talking and then like 12 seconds later hes screaming ""shut the fuck up"". Killed me. Elimination of mutant births were a byproduct of the gene enhancing properties of the water Yea....I wanted it to end peacefully but I kinda knew once they invited them for dinner (and especially when Xavier was saying how perfect it was) that it was disaster central from then on out. Logan was thinking the same thing, he just let Xavier talk him out of leaving. In addition to this, the whole movie I knew Hugh was limping and generally looking weak because the character was slowly dying, but it gave the ending so much more impact when you see him back to form fighting against himself at his absolute peak. to me the green juice didnt last long enough I was thinking the same. Deadpool would be easiest part of the franchise to handwave her into, and then from there they can decide whether or not to make her part of the broader universe. Also gives Reynolds lots of leeway to crack jokes about not getting Jackman. I realize now that he was telling her what Charles had been telling him all along: you don't have to be the weapon. Find you, and be that.  Can confirm: lump in my throat when he kept repeating it Caliban was always pretty lame in the comic books, but Logan created something beautiful out of him. Big ups to Merchant. Shit, I don't remember that. ""See kids? That's love. Not the 'dad, what did you bring us?' crap of yours""  It was December, 1921.  I was a racist.  A gay racist. Yeah. She kinda reminds me of Ellie from ""The last of us""

Anyway, would love to see her in an another x-men movie after a couple of years. Seeing her grow up slowly with the movies. Much like the harry potter movies growing with the actors.

 It seems like without a dose of that ""medicine"" X24 isn't recovering any time soon.


It looked all but wiped out the first time until Rice dosed it up. 
Likely not unkillable just *really* durable.  that part got me the most, man Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart knocked it out of the park My favorite part was the total unbridled rage Logan let out after X died. So berserk that he was straight up destroying the clone for a few moments despite his decrepit condition. The emotion was just so damn real. I sorta missed that, yeah. They basically did something like create a mutant vaccine or something? He made some crack about it going the way of Polio, but I wasn't sure if it was just him being a dick and calling mutants a disease, or him saying that he ""cured"" it. Thank you for clarifying, even though I watched the movie tonight in the AVX cinema I've always had a hard time making out what people say (I swear everyone mumbles)
 I mean I don't know what happened in the comics but it makes more sense.

I have a feeling Wolverine could be stopped. Charles all of a sudden killing everyone is completely possible.
 

  
  

^^^superman ^^^would ^^^obliterate ^^^batman  Well.. Fuck. choo choo muther fucker Man, the first guy moving his eyes was so fucked up. I loved it Those screams of his when he was getting boosted on the drugs. So powerful. Made me all tense up in my seat out of excitement  How do they reconcile it being 2029?  I doubt the next dead pool is set in the future like that I'm glad I'm not the only one that got reminded of ""The last of us.""  Laura still should've decapitated the fucker. It was very fitting for both of them to announce the retirement of their characters; there's no better sendoff than this movie. And to think they killed Professor X before and it was terrible. 

This one tore me in half  Yeah, it's in a bit of a throwaway line so I didn't catch it all, but that's what I gathered--they basically used the food supply to prevent people from passing on the mutant gene, which effectively cut the birth rate of mutants to 0.  In the comic it's directly stated that none of the X-men could bring themselves to actually kill him while he was being manipulated.

I think having it be Charles is just fine too, though. This movie was very different from Old Man Logan. [deleted] They said they'd have Cable in Deadpool 2. His backstory is that he's a warrior raised in a hellish future, who came to the present day -- and who has inherent time travel abilities. There's a series where he and Deadpool traipse around exploring alternate timelines. He'd be the perfect person to bring Laura in, if they decide to go down that path. There were some parts that were taken from Old man Logan, like how the wasn't any mutants or heroes left or anything. But even Logan's situation with being poisoned by his adamantium was taken from ""The death of Wolverine"" To me, it definitely makes more sense to have been Xavier. At that point no one is wondering why he wasn't stopped because the audience knows  no one really *could* stop that. Throughout the movies its always something the mutants know can happen if he had wanted and fear it,  it's even part of the plot of X-2. >In the comic it's directly stated that none of the X-men could bring themselves to actually kill him while he was being manipulated.


That just seems dumb. Wolvie killing the X-men? Sure. Everyone letting themselves be utterly chumped because Feelings? Not so much. Sure it probably made for some intense reading though.

Anyhow, the way the film handled it was more elegant and made more sense to me. It was ambiguous enough that I could see Xavier having some sort of moment where he just drops the ball. What scared me was those primal snarls when he was having that nightmare. I thought the claws were going to come out just like in X1. Plus doesn't he have a storyline revolving around the first new mutant in ages? ",0
176,"I could have watched that movie on mute and been just as dazzled as I was in the theater. The CGI is absolutely stunning. I think the thing that really sold it was the movements of the animals, they must have spent so much time reconstructing realistic animal movement. 

Bill Murray KILLED it.

I jumped between horrified and entertained when King Louie was singing. I like that King Louie looked a bit like Christopher Walken. Or maybe Christopher Walken just looks like a giant monkey. I love the little cowbell nod before we saw King Louie Everyone raving about Elba/Shere Khan, but my man Bagheera carried this movie IMO.  Did anybody notice the warthog standing next to the meercat towards the end. Timon and Pumba get at cameo!  ""You've never been closer to extinction then you are at this point in time""

Fucking dead. [deleted] I would watch it again just for the credits. Idris Elba really killed it as Shere Khan, really menacing and intimidating. When he threw Akila off the cliff all of sudden....holy shit Christopher Walken actually sang I Wanna Be Like You. It was everything I hoped it could be. 10/10 The scale of King Louie is so impressive. That alone had me captivated! [deleted] I thought it was really cool how elephants were recognized and respected.

Also, I really need to try a papaya.  Baloo and Mowgli looked so happy singing The Bear Necessities :)  Shere Khan gave nooo fucks about Akela. The movie was awesome but can we talk about the credits? Fucking beautiful.  The Jungle Book exceeded any expectations I may have had. I was wary (despite the all star cast) that this would turn out to be underwhelming for a live action rendition but I am happy to see my worries stifled, much like the red flower.  
  
**A few things that stuck out to me:**  
  
King Louie was much more sinister than I recall from the animated Disney version. I was impressed with the attention to detail when the director was building tension (such as Louie's hair being left behind as he arose due to having remained in his throne for such a long time undisturbed).  
.  
My boyfriend and I were both floored with how emotionally we reacted to the Bear Necessities. I was worried Bill Murray was a miscast (I recall some saying John Goodman would have been better and at first I agreed). The rapport was very organic between a naïve child and a cunning (yet oafish) bear.  
.  
Sher Khan's story about the cuckoo (and subsequent scene transition featuring one) was incredibly well done. It was tense, yet innocuous on the surface. The perfect balance to instill doubt without spoon feeding the audience with the metaphor.  
  .    
I could go on, however, just as a side note, I found both the porcupine and the pangolin's personalities to be quite endearing. A great amount of comedic relief without being overbearing.   
  
As another side note, the little dialogue between Baloo and Mowgli discussing ""Propaganda"" (regarding the wolves creed) was adorable. I audibly laughed, just as a young girl asked her mother just moments after that exchange ""what IS propaganda?"". My boyfriend and I couldn't help but wonder what the best way to explain propaganda to a young child would be, not unlike our protagonists.  
  
.  
  
Overall, we both really loved the movie. My boyfriend had no idea what he was getting into, as he didn't see any trailers or hear much about its existence. I saw the trailers and was wary, but I'm glad I knew about it as I went into it with low expectations and left with them exceeded.  
.  
  
**Edit**: I wrongfully thought Louie was in the book. Redacted that commentary.  For a contemporary blockbuster this is a remarkably patient film. In order to instill in its audience the sort of wonder it ultimately summons, it allows itself to linger on small moments most modern blockbusters have no time for, so that by the end of the film, we know the Law of the Jungle as well as Mowgli and his pack, and we care that Shere Kahn has threatened it.

Of course none of that would be possible without the extraordinary work of the bajillion CG artists who worked to make this film as stunning as it is. It's easy to heap praise on the voice actors, who all certainly did amazing jobs, but their performances came to vivid life thanks to those artists.

I know some people didn't like the intrusion of the songs, but this movie is like a myth, and its songs are the most vivid reminders of the timelessness of this story.

This movie simultaneously made me proud to be human, and encouraged me to remember my responsibility to nature. I had a classic Disney experience.

TL;DR: got high, LOVED the movie
 If you think about it... a big theme of this movie is a people (the wolves) coming to accept a person who is from somewhere else and isn't quite like them (Mowgli) for who he is, and realizing it's better to celebrate him for who he is rather than trying to force him to be like everyone else or leave. I don't know about you, but i'm happy that that's a story being told nowadays, especially considering some of the worlds biggest issues right now. king louie needed more cowbell [deleted] Easily one of the best movies to come from Disney. Unbelievably brilliant CGI. 

Definitely going for a second time!  Can we take a moment to admit that Shere Khan is really the tragic hero of this movie? Spoilers ahead.

Seriously though, all this guy really wants to do is protect his home from getting burned down. Everyone fully admits that man is destructive and talks about them burning down the fucking forest. But naw, this guy's cool. And you know what this little fucker does? He burns down the fucking forest! And after we have very clearly proved that Khan was right all along, they band together and fucking kill the poor bastard. What do the fucking wolves care, they live up on fucking pride rock, why would they give a fuck if the forest burns down? Shere Khan was sticking up for the working middle-class forest creatures against wolf pack tyranny.

Jungle Book represents everything that is truly wrong about society. Khan shows up, everyone cowers in fear at the sight of him. You know what that does to someone after a long time? Here's a place where everyone is supposed to be equal, but no, not the fucking tiger. Bunch of fucking racists. I mean the guy clearly has PTSD and instead of getting him the help that he needs they villainize him. Did Zootopia teach us nothing? #TigerLivesMatter

You know what, don't worry about it Mowgli, 80% of our home is gone, but since you came in with the fucking mute elephants and put the fire out we're totally fucking chill. Bullshit. All of this could have been prevented if they had just killed that little shit from the get-go.

\#ShereKhanDidNothingWrong I like this movie and this movie one of my favorite movies so far in 2016. The Voice cast were good and convincing from the Kaa, Baloo, to Shere Khan.

I don't have any problem if Disney took this approach for their upcoming live-action adaptations. It is a success with this movie and Cinderella. This approach may straight forward but they added some dimensions and properly executed those movie.

Also, Neel Sethi as Mowgli was amazing and it is not easy to for a child actor to act in front of green screen for the entire movie. So, overall, I really enjoyed it. 

I was absolutely blown away by the animation. It's probably the most realistic stuff I've ever seen in a movie, *maybe* excluding Avatar. 

I'm not joking when I say the animals actually looked real (for the most part). There was some stuff that didn't quite mesh well, mostly during the shots where characters and environments are moving or shifting around quickly, but those moments were few and far between.

The acting was really solid as well. Idris Elba, Ben Kinglsey, and Bill Murray were pretty much perfect in every way. Christopher Walken was...himself, which is pretty great. 

Neel Sethi, I thought, did a really good job. Some of his lines felt a bit forced or over acted, but he nailed the physicality of Mowgli. It's definitely not easy for a kid his age to act on a sound stage with that much green/blue screen happening around him, so props to Favreau for really pushing his performance to the max. 

I think the biggest problem I had was the editing. Some of it just felt really strangely paced and timed, specifically in the climax, which felt *really* drawn out. 

The songs were...weird. I think that's because there's only two, and the first one, 'Bare Necessities', doesn't come in until well past the start of the second act. To me, it seemed out of place with the how the rest of the movie played out. Maybe that's just because I'm used to the old cartoon version. 

But again, overall, I really enjoyed it. Super solid work all around from the cast and from the incredible artists who made the animals and the world almost literally come to life. 

Edit: I only saw it in 2D, so I have no idea if the 3D adds anything significant. If what I heard it true, then it's like a whole other movie and really something special.  I really loved this movie. It still had the child story vibe but Favreau adapted it super well. He knew which parts of the story were vital and which could be kept out. I think one of the biggest things was how he gave Shere Khan more depth than the old animated film did. 

The visual effects are as good as everyone is making them out to be and it really baloo (hah...) me away. Aside from some of the smaller animals (flying squirrels, etc.) everything looked phenomenal and all of the main big animals and the setting looked as real as ever. 

For me, I think the voice acting is what sold me on it all. I think each character was perfectly cast and the voices were exactly how I would expect each animal to talk if I were thinking about it in my head as well as based on what the old animated feature gave us. 

The Jungle Book was always one of, if not, my favorite stories as a kid and I'm just happy that Jon Favreau could take advantage of the tools and technology today and bring this to life like we've never seen before. The movie is a ton of fun, especially if you are a fan of the classic and there are a ton of great moments. Favreau has always been great, but he seriously ups his cred with each new movie he puts out.  Disney has really been killing it with their recent films. Such a gorgeous film, really nice story, and great acting all around. Really loved the elephants and King Louie. Wow, this was such a fun film to watch.

First off, yes the CGI was fantastic and totally engrossing. If you want a pretty movie to watch this is one of the prettiest I've seen in a good bit.

I think most of the voice acting was spot on. Lupita Nyong'o has some great, emotionally filled scenes. Other times she seems a bit wooden. Scarlett Johansson was also good, but her scene was kind of unnecessary imo.

Otherwise every other voice actor does their job perfectly. Kingsley as Baheera brings that wise presence to the film, Idris Elba is terrifying as Shere Khan, Bill Murray is just hilarious as Baloo, he has quite a few great jokes. Giancarlo Esposito didn't have much to say, but when he did it felt like a wise father figure.

And Chrisopher Walken as King Louie... maybe the best casting in the whole movie. He perfectly encapsulates everything I remember King Louie being in the original film. He stole the movie for the brief time he was in it.

Now Neel Sethi as Mowgli. Look, he doesn't steal any scenes and he's not great sometimes. In fact he has a couple of parts where you can tell he's just really, really inexperienced as an actor. But, I give this kid credit for the job he had to do acting across virtually nothing for the whole film. He gets a passing grade from me though.

The story is actually surprisingly well done. It doesn't vary much from the animated film, but it's more like a puffed up version. It has these little twists that make it entirely its own while still feeling familiar.

Music is great. Hearing Bill Murray and Christopher Walken sing will never not bring me joy.

Also, I really, really liked the way they handled Mowgli's character. You'll know what I mean when you see it. They give us little sprinkles of info about him early on that end up paying off gradually through the film until finally it becomes a huge part of who he is. I was very impressed with how Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks gave Mowgli some layers as a character that I didn't think the animated film version had.

Overall, this is by far the best of these new Disney ""live action"" films yet. And I say that as someone who enjoyed the Cinderella remake. This was and remains my all-time favorite animated Disney movie, and Favreau nailed it. 

So many nostalgic moments for me. The opening incorporating that mysterious, dark score from the animated film. The backdrop of Mowgli and Bagheera walking against the waterfall. The moonlight shining on the river after King Louie's temple collapsed. They found clever ways to weave the songs in, giving it a unique twist despite using the same lyrics. 

I think John Debney did a great job weaving the songs into his score too, though the soundtrack certainly sounded like a mesh of many different movies I've heard recently. The score when the elephants diverted the river flow was a particular emotional highlight for me. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the interpretation. Shere Khan and the expanded role of the wolves was great. The Akela death shocked me, especially. Kaa revealing Mowgli's past added exposition in a clever, interesting way. 

I loved Murray and Kingsley as Baloo and Bagheera, though the bond between Mowgli and Baloo didn't really gel for me, as much as it did in the animated film. Such that Baloo ""breaking"" the news to Mowgli lacked emotional impact. I also found some of the scenes of Mowgli running toward the beginning and the final confrontation between Shere Khan and the animals to be disorienting. 

But when that book closed at the end, I could hardly hold back my tears, as it evoked so many memories of watching this as a child. Well done Jon Favreau, the VFX/CGI crew, the voice actors, and all the other supporting crew. I really really liked Scarlet Johansson as Kaa 

Her singing the song during the credits was so, so soothing, I wouldn't even mind if she killed me... The CGI blew my mind. Everything that you see on screen except for Neel Sethi is computer generated. I couldn't get my head around it for a while.  Cowbell brings out King Walken...


Hmmmm
 Christopher Walken brought so much to King Louie with just his voice. The warmth, the ego, the incredible intimidation. 

The voice acting was just all around impressive.  If Zathura and Chef didn't convince you already that Favreau is great at directing children, this movie did.

Fun fact: the kid from Chef actually voices one of the wolf cubs in this movie. If I had Idris Elba's voice, I'd never fucking shut up. He fucking killed it. 

Walken was great too. I didn't like Bill Murray as Baloo much though. 

The mixing is much better in the movie. I was worried since I felt it was off in the trailers. 

Kinda felt it was stupid that the animals rallied behind Mowgli after the fire though, Shere Khan was right. But eh, the movie was still pretty cool. Did anyone else really appreciate King Louie's badass Apocalypse Now introduction? This was excellent. Now give me a state-of-the-art adaption of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, please and thank you. Great movie. Some of the CGI seemed so life-like - the grass/tree sets - that I was convinced Disney used real sets as a point of reference. They probably were just real but I really hope it was CGI, because WOW.

Thought more time could have been spent on the Mowgli/Baloo relationship prior to him telling Mowgli to leave, but the rapport they had was excellent and Murray was, of course, great. ""I Wanna be Like You"" also felt quite forced and tonally awkward (Louie was all angry and intimidating while this boppy music played up...?). Think it would have worked better in just the credits alone, because Walken's performance itself was awesome.

Everything else was excellent. Disney once again proving that they're the smartest studio in Hollywood. Absolutely loved it! Breathtakingly beautiful animation. Usually I get annoyed when they show-horn A-listers to voice act to capitalize on their name, but the cast was phenomonal. I especially loved Ben Kingsley as Bagheera. One of my favorite Disney characters as a kid, and I loved how they showed him fight Shere Khan. When I was younger that was something that I always wanted to see and I never understood why they never interacted. We see Baloo's fatherly devotion and love for Mowgli in that he stands up and fights Shere Khan and I always was bummed how Bagheera didn't do the same. Favorite movie of this year so far

9.5/10 Was it just me that supported Sherkhan considering the developments that Man has made in the Jungle worlds destroying their habitats? Loved the film and thought it was a great achievement in CGI but I'm not sure if the kids will enjoy it. The tone is a sandwich of dark and scary. So much so that when it gets to the fun and lighthearted Baloo segments which got some honest laughs from me, I had to reengage with the movie because it simply didn't resemble the tension and terror the previous 40 or so minutes held. I thought it was beautiful, and well directed. I thought the acting was pretty brilliant, but...I left so dissatisfied.

They Disneyfied Disney. Seriously. It drove me NUTS that Mowgli gets to stay in the jungle. The whole point of the story is that he HAS to leave because it isn't safe - not just for him, but for the rest of the animals. Man is not compatible with the jungle, nor is the jungle compatible with man. I would have thought there was a good conservationist moral to be made there, in a fun, and inspiring way, but they totally missed it...

Likewise, the idea that Mowgli is lured into the man-village by a pretty young girl could have been interesting, if they symbolically linked her to the elephants. She bends her arms, and draws furrows into the earth to redirect some water into her basin, showing that yes, man has the power of destruction in the red flower, but can also bend the earth to gentle, symbiotic purpose with water. Like the elephants. It just seemed like a missed opportunity.

Likewise, although I LOVED Elba's performance, I am one of the few unhappy with the fact that his accent wasn't standardised RP. I thought by having him sound like a cultured aristocrat, there could have been some interesting comments made about British Imperialism. Shere Khan with the voice of an English gentleman deliberately, and consciously stepping into the territories of other animals and oppressing them sort of how the British, you know, went into India. The wolves as the loyal, but unimaginative military force. Bagheera is the native officer who speaks like an Englishman but is never afforded the same respect. Mowgli as the outsider who loves a place, and can belong to two places, but can't force his own culture on another...

It just seemed like...I don't know, there was more that could have been said, more depth to have been exposed than there was. Not necessarily in the way I laid out, but it did all feel a bit shallow to me.

Also, this version was much less cut-throat than even the cartoon. It just felt gutless. I don't mean that I need blood and mangled corpses, but there were no stakes because no one was in danger of dying. Akela only did because it served to advance the plot, but death can also advance the themes that were in play, and because none happened (outside of Akela) there didn't really seem to be any danger.

Bagheera and Baloo are swiping at monkeys, and lying on them, and the monkeys get up, shake out their fur and run off. They don't even seem stunned. Fire burns through the jungle, but no one is ever seriously in danger. It doesn't even come close. Why should I care about the danger inherent in Mowgli's presence, or Shere Khan's actions, or marvel at the power of the jungle if there is none to be had?

ALSO Kaa - Kaa is totally shoehorned in. Why not, at the end of the story, reveal that Kaa slithered up, and devoured Mowgli's father, thus giving her presence there a purpose, and making her complicit in Mowgli's disenfranchisement?

And then, at other times, the script resorted to cheap cliches for no reason. Like when Baloo tries to drive Mowgli off by saying he means nothing to him? It was a cheap emotional ploy. Mowgli STILL would have been upset enough to go off and sulk had Baloo calmly, and politely told him he had to go, and why. No need to be a dick about it in the most cliche way possible.

Just...I don't know. It was extraordinary in some ways, but it didn't thrill me. It didn't give me the shivers. Loved it! though surprised the ending where he goes to the village was specifically left out, and I'm curious as to why... though assume it's for the sequel. edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OlIvMhnJkQ

(http://i.imgur.com/wbISXdY.jpg / http://i.imgur.com/buCZjOa.jpg) 

Have Favreau/Marks spoken to this yet?

I was anticipating it, and was looking forward to how they'd do it, but the movie didn't end with the girl fetching water and flirting with Mowgli, luring him into the village ultimately. Instead it ends just before that scene, when Bagheera, Mowgli and Baloo are celebrating (on a tree together, in this case – which was adorable, yes, obviously).

So are they having Mowgli stay in the jungle for the sequel? Would have been cool to see this scene play out in this new world, but if it's coming in a sequel I suppose maybe that's just as fine. But I like the bittersweet ending where he ultimately leaves the jungle, to stop playing, and grow up and discover new things.

That's my only question/curiosity/complaint. It was a fun movie! Wow, what a fantastic surprise. I haven't loved a Disney movie like that in a long time. I think it's better than the animated version, which is such a fantastic feat for a 2016 remake. I can't wait to see it again. It's a shame this won't be considered for best animated movie of the year, because man, would this have been hard to beat. Man, that bear was really awesome. He's really killing it this year after the revenant. 

I don't know who they want to play Pooh in the live action Winnie the Pooh film but he's gotta be on the list at least. Minority opinion here apparently, but the movie didn't do much for me. It wasn't infuriating but there were few if any real stand out moments. King Louie was great, Bill Murray did a good job, as did Elba, but overall it didn't leave that much of an impact.  It takes some elements from the books, that gave it it's gothic mythic nature but not enough so it just feels stuck between the Disney whimsy and it. 

I also thought the happy ending was a little too cheesey for the Jungle Book  and didn't make sense. Uniting the Jungle was never really a thing. Plus Mowgali gives up the fire when he sees how he's causing destruction the way a man does, but then fights Shere Khan with fire so that just seemed pointless.  Neel Sethi's acting left a lot to be desired too. 

I don't think it's terrible, just not very memorable. Nothing made me laugh out loud or really got me in the heart. 

Plus they mispronounced every Hindi word they used so that was really annoying.  All right, time to be that asshole... this movie is just okay. And I'm a huge Jon Favreau fan. But a 94% RT movie this is not.

Let's start with the good. Like the other recent Disney remakes, this film makes a decent attempt to differentiate itself from its animated predecessor. Making Mogwli an internally-troubled engineer (so to speak) was an awesome creative choice, particularly when he saves the baby elephant to John Debney's ""Bare Necessities""-inspired score. That was one of the few times the movie successfully wove musical nostalgia in a way that worked (more on this later).

Additionally, with all this talk about the animation, I will say that the filmmakers did a phenomenal job in making us buy the existence of talking animals. A goofy bear voiced by Bill Murray could have felt out of place in a live-action movie. But the filmmakers instead made the animals realistic enough to be impressive but cartoonish enough to avoid the uncanny valley when they talk. You can’t make a talking bear as realistic as say the Revenant bear, but this attempt is as good as it gets. R.I.P. Garry Shandling as well.

Now the bad.

The pacing and editing for this film are incredibly awkward. Baloo is introduced, develops a friendship with Mogwli, and breaks off the friendship in a “misunderstanding” cliché all in less than half an act. King Louie somehow knows of the death of Akela while the communication between different animals with different languages remains unclear. Mogwli somehow sets the entire jungle on fire instantaneously with one torch. These are just a few examples of the film’s oddities, on top of all the various sequences dully drawn out or rapidly chopped together.

Now, here’s the point I get downvoted… the actor playing Mogwli does not do a very good job, despite comments to the contrary. I hate saying that because after The Last Airbender disaster, any time Hollywood casts a child actor of the correct race should be applauded. But here the kid overacts and often times looks confused about what he’s acting toward. Not his fault, though. This is what happens when you take a boy less than 10 with no acting experience and throw him into an all-green-screen movie. I’m sure it was challenging, but with a $175 million budget, couldn’t we have given this kid a couple more shots at some of the key lines? I’d say bring on Andy Serkis as a motion capture coach, but of course he’s making his own Jungle Book movie.

The screenplay also fails to give Mogwli an interesting personality. Look at the animated movie. Mogwli moves around like an animal, scruffs down bananas without manners, whines and moans… not a perfect character, but at least there’s someone cynical for the positive Baloo can bounce off of. It’s interesting to watch. Here Baloo is part con artist bouncing off of a kid who has zero personality. Imagine if Mogwli bit back at Baloo’s comments as well as build the mechanism to bring down the honeycombs? You would have had a dynamic buddy relationship more interesting to listen to and watch than the animated movie. Alas, it falters instead.

Finally, the movie awkwardly tries to combine elements from the original book and the animated film together and suffers from it. “Bare Necessities” sung off key by Bill Murray is unnecessary. King Louie singing “I Wanna Be Like You” makes even less sense – he’s Disney-invented character, but uses the term “red flower” from the book, but then sings the lyrics “red fire” in his Disney-written song. The up-down inconsistency was grating.

Overall, Jon Favreau’s Jungle Book is vastly overrated movie. An admirable attempt to be sure, but not the must-see event it’s making itself out to be. Ball’s in your court, Andy Serkis. [deleted] Quick question, is it worth watching it in 3D? The last movie I really enjoyed watching in 3D was Coraline.  I saw it tonight, and I gotta say: this is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. The CGI is breathtakingly dazzling and the voice cast is exquisitely cast. I have a hard time remembering the last time I was so thoroughly engrossed in the world-building a movie had created. I honestly can't wait to see this again.

I saw it in 3D, and if you can — GO SEE IT IN 3D. It was mesmerizing. Each element onscreen popped and made for a wonderful experience. Absolutely worth the extra money, and that's the first time I can remember saying that about 3D. Can we just take a moment and appreciate how brilliant Giancarlo Esposito was in the film? The voice was so authorative and yet so kind. *""... But most importantly, we now have peace.""*

Saw this movie in 3D and I'd highly recommend it, much against reddit.com popular opinion. Had all of the hall slack jawed and at the edge of their seats from start to finish.  When they first showed us Kaa I was wondering how they would do the hypno eyes and man, it was awesome. lol  This is the 2016 visual equivalent of what Avatar was in 2009.  The 3D is so incredibly worth it and it's a great new take on a classic story. I was squeeing internally at how cute the wolves and the wolf puppies were King Louie's song made me go ""wait, what?"" Like, he's basically threatening to murder this child and suddenly you hear the opening bars of his song start up. It's quite a bouncy and upbeat song too. I almost burst out laughing at the tonal whiplash.

I appreciated the wolves getting a larger role in this film. Their role in raising Mowgli was one of my favorite concepts about the book and the animated film kinda glossed over it. It helped that Mowgli's mother was one of the most endearing characters in it to me. 

I do question how Shere Khan seems to be invincible in this movie. How accurate is such a power level for a jungle tiger? It was awesome, don't get me wrong, but still. Saw the movie last week in regular 2d. And I must say that I wasn't impressed. I'm not sure what I expected from this movie, but definitely not what I saw. First of all, the visuals were great for the most part. Obviously, the most attention was paid to main characters and their animation, so most other creatures looked a bit fake. The best animated and looking ones were Bagheera and Shere Khan, Balu felt bit fakey in my opinion. Wolves looked the worst of the bunch and had little emotion on their faces in comparison to other main animals. The cinematography was pretty nice for the most part, some really creative visuals here and there but aside from few scenes nothing much stands out in my mind. Don't want to spoil anything, but few scenes at the end of the movie were pretty breathtaking.

The kid that played Mowgli is alright. He's not terrible, but he's not very good either. I never bought him as a kid of the jungle, though, but considering that all he had to work with is green screen I think he did alright. He looked the part, that's for sure.

The thing that disappointed and underwhelmed me the most is the story. Yeah, I know some of you will say that it's just a kids' movie, what do you expect and the original wasn't that smart and so on, and all I can answer is that it's not an excuse. This movie felt shallow. Like really, really shallow and it felt underdeveloped. First of all, with new more realistic visuals the viewer expects a bit more realism in workings of the world. I can buy talking animals, I can buy singing animals, but what I can't buy is the kid who lived all his life in a jungle among feral animals who never shows any signs of it, never acts like an animal (aside from like one short moment in the whole movie) and overall just feels like just a human that just got lost in a jungle for one weekend. I know it was like that in the original movie, but that was a silly comedy that never made pretense that it's somehow serious. This movie really wanted to be smarter and more serious, but it missed its chance completely. You can suspense the disbelief only so much until it breaks. And it breaks hard right from the beginning. Kids' acting certainly didn't help, but I must say that he acted like a kid and never felt more advanced that he looked, which is rare among child characters in movies.

The plot was a bit more coherent and developed than the one from the original movie, but had little of that Disney trademark heart in it. The emotional moments rang hollow, because the movie never bothered to make a viewer sympathise or relate to Mowgli. He's a very simple character. He's just a kid who wants to stay in the jungle. That's it. There's little to no conflict or development in him. He almost never acts on his own and things just kinda happen to him and he gets thrown from one place to another, from one setpiece into another. He's boring. So is the movie, at least the first half. The first third, until Mowgli meets Balu contains plenty of cringeworthy moments (yeah, Disney family movies usually have plenty of them, but they usually feel genuine and with a heart in the right place) and was pretty boring. Lots of stuff happens that you, as a viewer, has no reason to care about because you had no chance to get invested in it. The story was very, very simple. A saturday morning cartoon kinda simple. There are no interesting themes being brought up, nothing of the sorts. Not entirely bad thing, but not enough for this movie's runtime, so there's a lot of padding.

Balu saves this movie. He isn't particularly funny, but he's likeable and brings much-needed silliness to the overall proceedings and gives the movie a second breath. He's a good addition to the story and makes it more lighthearted and fun. His song was also really nice and adds a lot to the movie. So does King Louie. He's the best part of the movie. I kid you not. He's menacing, he's interesting, he's awesome. And his song is so much fun, even if it starts from out of almost nowhere. I liked him a lot and his setpiece is very enjoyable to watch. Shere Khan is meh. Sure, his animation is spectacular and he can be pretty frightening, but he's just as shallow as any of them. You have no reason to care for him, out of sympathy or an interest. Looks cool, but he mostly does nothing throughout the movie outside of growling and looking menacing. Still, his scenes are enjoyable enough, especially at the end. Bagheera is a nice mentor figure, but there isn't much more to him.

Cinderella gave the tired old story new, fresh blood by adding much needed complexity into the story and its characters. Not the whole lot, but it was on point and made it much more enjoyable. It had plenty of heart and a lot of Disney's trademark magic. This one tries to do the same, but trips over its own tail constantly. It's like nobody knew what to do with it. Make it gritty or make it silly, make it dark or make it fun. It's a mess. When it works, it works brilliantly, when it doesn't it's just boring. Maybe if I watched the English version I'd like it more, but I'm not sure that good voice actors can save a lame story. Maybe I expected too much from this movie and wanted an epic journey full of perils and challenges, interesting story and characters. I probably should've known better.

It's not a bad movie and it's certainly watchable, but it's not very good either. If you love the original one you'll probably like this one too. It might be the best The Jungle Book out there, though, whatever that counts for. Usually Disney movies leave me feeling really good about myself and the world, this one left me with nothing. Btw, that awesome Bare Necessities music from the trailers isn't used in the movie until the very end for one small sequence. Major letdown. Also, the trailers showed every major setpiece in the movie. The theater was full of kids and they laughed all the time, so they probably liked the movie a whole lot.

TL;DR It was underwhelming. 
 So, who else felt absolutely terrified when Shere Khan was on screen? He had such a commanding presence. He did something in the movie that I was not expecting at all, especially for a PG rated feature. I wonder what the kids felt watching this I wasn't really a fan of this. I felt like Neel Sethi was a pretty bad actor, and some of the delivery was pretty weak.

The visuals are gorgeous mostly, but there are some points where the live action and CGI just doesn't mix well. It seems to end up feeling fake at points.

The voice cast was good though, and the saving factor. Bill Murray and Idris Elba were probably the best part. CGI done right looks incredible.  It makes me so fucking happy this movie is good. 

Listening to this bear necessities orchestration on a loop has really reminded me just how much i loved this movie as a kid. 

I cannot wait to see this. I found the songs kind of underwhelming... like when King Louie just sits and sings. He should've moved around a little Few 3D movies are worth the price hike. The problem is, at the theater I usually frequent, the biggest and best screen is also the 3D screen, which means I’m stuck paying extra to see movies that don’t need 3D, aren’t filmed with 3D in mind, and don’t use the 3D gimmick properly. Even a big blockbuster like Batman v Superman barely deserved to be in 3D. For the most part, it’s simply a gimmick to bring in more money to studios.

But every now and then, a movie comes along that totally makes the 3D effect worth it.

Jungle Book is it.

If I had to nitpick anything, I’d say it’s a little weird that there are only two songs in the movie and neither are heard until a good hour into the picture, and both happen within a thirty minute span. They kind of come out of nowhere, in other words. But they are very much “Jungle Book” songs. They fit the picture to a “T” and are sure to put a smile on your face. They serve to lighten the mood after some tense scenes (in the case of the first song) and really creep you out, in a good way (in the case of the second song). But that’s a very minor nitpick and barely worth mentioning. Really, this film is nearly perfect.

As for the 3D, it has perhaps the best usage of the format since Avatar, and in this case, it actually has a good film underneath the gimmick. Unlike other movies, that feel the need to fill the screen with particle effects and “pop out” visuals, this movie uses the feature to add depth to the picture. From the very first scene, as the camera moves away from the beautiful, hand-drawn animated “Disney castle” (sort of) to the heart of the jungle, the vast landscape feels wholly alive. It’s stunning at first, and though you get used to it after awhile, as you start getting into the movie, every now and then you are treated to a shot that looks like you’re staring out a window to a world that stretches for miles.  Amazing work for an amazing movie.

10/10 – There’s nothing I’d change. Brilliant film. Must see. Movie was great but the one thing I walked away saying is that Christopher Walken ain't Louis Prima.  Did it annoy anyone else that everyone always calls it red flower, but when King Louie's singing he rhymes desire with fire So I don't think this will be seen by anyone, but I am extremely surprised at how much /r/movies is loving this film.  I found it really underwhelming, especially compared to the praise it's getting.

The story and arc are extremely weak.  Just like the original, it's basically a series of loosely connected vignettes.

It's dangerous to center your film around a child actor acting opposite of CGI creations.  I understand that it's necessary for The Jungle Book, but the acting did not work for me.

The jungle literally has two women: Raksha and Kaa.  That's it.  Practically every other character that has a speaking role was male.

The two songs were wildly out of place.  Neither Bill Murray nor Christopher Walken are known for their singing prowess.  Nothing visually interesting or fun happens in those moments.  The movie just comes to a screeching halt to give us the two songs we remember from the original.

The animal CGI was admittedly very impressive.  The sheer 3D spectacle and scale were both pretty good (though nowhere near Avatar, as some have claimed).

I don't know what I expected.  This is exactly what I would have pictured from a live-action Disney Jungle Book, and yet all the rave reviews convinced me it was something more.  There's definitely some things to like, but I don't understand the ""one of the best Disney movies ever"" sentiment.  Zootopia came out literally six weeks ago, to say nothing of the past 80 years of classics. I watched the original Jungle Book over and over as a kid and this movie made me feel so damn nostalgic I almost shed a tear when they sang Bear(Bare?) Necessities. I'm really glad that they kept the songs from the originals but I still prefer the originals tho because King Louie wasn't as wacky(he's also goddamn huuuuuge). 

The overall voice cast was excellent but I personally didn't think ScarJo was the best choice for Kaa.

solid 8/10. So far Disney is on a roll with Zootopia, this, and with positive reviews on Captain America. Disney has made my two favorite films of the year so far and I can't wait to see what Disney can bring for the rest of this year.  I wanna talk like you.... walk like you..... I want.... to...be like...you... Scariest fking monkey ever. Watched the movie last week. Loved every minute of it. CGI artists deserve a standing ovation. A remarkable feat. 

Disney has nailed the marketing in India. In the 90s, we had a dubbed run of the [anime adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Book_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Mowgli) in various languages. Immensely popular with all the kids. Disney took in the songs from the series for the localized versions and even brought in some of the voice actors from the series for the localized versions. Jungle Book would probably become the highest grossing Hollywood movie in India. Average occupancy in multiplexes in Kerala have been around 98% in the last week. How was the audio mixing?  On all the trailers, the voice actors sounded exactly like they were in a recording box, a million miles from the jungle and disconnected from the animals.  Did they fix that for the movie? Those aramdilo thing, tiny hog and squirl where alot more important to me then i could ever expect This was my first 4X movie experience. Great movie for it. The chairs move, get sprayed with mist, gets cold. Made me smile nearly as much as the film did. Send like they filmed it for the 4X experience. I always [loved this trailer for Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS1BM9XRgvw) with Giancarlo Esposito reading The Law of the Jungle. Was really nice to hear him say it again as Akela. is no one gonna acknowledge the fact that kaa says shere khan didnt notice mowgli when he killed his father but then he proceeds to state like 5 times later in the film ""lol mowgli i killed ur dad. get rekt.""? this fucking annoyed the shit out of me! ""If we believe there's even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty."" -Batman/Shere Khan King Louie was huge and well voiced, yes. But did anyone notice how MASSIVE Kaa was? Her body stretched across that clearing and she was thick as a trunk.  Did anyone else feel disappointed with Kaa in this adaptation?

Very little screentime, and only existed to explain Mowgli's backstory. Even cut her song and slapped it in the credits. Was a shame too cause I thought Scarlett did an amazing job. I love the little cowbell nod before we saw King Louie This movie was fantastic.  It looked great as everyone has been saying.  That scene with Bagheera and Mowgli walking in front of the waterfall made me think of Hakuna Matata with Simba and co. walking across and singing.  

Live action Lion King?  With the music?  Thoughts??? Really enjoyed this movie, it's visually amazing, incredible cgi, great voice acting, and it was a very fun expirience, defenitley gonna watch it again in imax What they did with the expressions and body language of Shere Khan was chilling and at the same time mind boggling.  With Idris's voice over that was one of the most incredible villains I have ever seen.   Did anyone else notice a suspicious looking LAMP some of the villagers appeared to be fighting over when Moglai was looking on into the village bonfire?!?! Easter egg for a upcoming live action Aladdian?! King Louie blew me away, he looked amazing! None of the trailers I saw showed him and I was totally awe struck when he stepped out of the shadows.  When Murray started singing ""The Bare Necessities"" they had me...singing. 

And shouldn't it be called ""The Bear Necessities""??? is it safe to say this movie was the best since lion king from disney?

at least i thought so My 4 y.o. daughter had to poop after Shere Khan falls off the tree. What happened after that? I got the feeling that they actually made Louie's eyes to match Walken's so it made Louie look a bit like him I was both impressed and creeped the fuck out by this. It's like they took Walken's eyes and put them into Louie, and it looked amazing. Louie is an Ape, you filthy scum as an SNL fan I'm very ashamed of myself for not catching that And how his introduction was like Marlin Brando in Apocalypse Now!

Also, unrelated to anything, but I saw this movie with a Chinese friend, who didn't know anything about the original, they must have been so WTF when they started singing songs in the movie!! Wait, I didn't get it? Is there some context to the cowbell?  I did not catch this at all. Did anyone happen to catch the Timon and Pumba reference during the scene where the animals gathered by the water during the day? I was pretty excited about catching that. Yes, That would be the ideal movie reviewer comment.
Needs more cowbell.

Non movie reviewer, me, comment.
Wondrous movie! Oh my gosh, I totally forgot about that. ""I gotta fevah, and the only prescription, is more cowbell"" Everyone was great. Even the kid. Wow, they actually found a great kid actor. For sure, I actually expected more Kingsley praise than I've seen. I love Bagheera in this film because he easily could have been a cookie cutter character but instead he is fully realized. I especially enjoyed Bagheera and Baloo's mini-arc over the second half of the film. Their interaction at the end of fight where Baloo is ailing but Bagheera offers words of encouragement was quite poignant. All of this before even mentioning Bagheera's animation which stood out to me the most (in the best way) in a film of incredible animation. I could watch Bagheera hawking down Shere Khan in the climax on repeat. Can you imagine if they give the same treatment to Lion King? Except they have to do all the songs.  Good eye. Thank you so much!!!! I looked for this comment for a while now to have some support! I loved this small little cameo, it was awesome. still trying to convince my wife that it happened. It was just so quick.  I believe it was ""you've never been more of an endangered species"", but yeah Baloo was pretty funny. It was tense, but it also makes sense. In the actual book, more or less that's what happens. Shere Khan starts hanging around the younger wolves and trying to sway them to his side, and it works a little bit. When Mowgli returns to the jungle, there's a little bit more of a divide in the wolf pack because of it. I loved how this movie kept parts of the Disney cartoon while also doing a lot of references to the actual book. Such a good balance.  They were just trying not to get hurt by Shere Fairplay  lol I think that went to show how scary man-cub turning into man could have been-- even his 'brothers' cowered in fear when the red flower was being brandished. But like said up above, Mowgli defied this by throwing the fire into the pond and proceeded to beat the Tiger in the 'jungle' way ha! didn't expect to see a Pearl Islands reference here!  /r/survivor  [deleted] Man, that startled me, I was not prepared. I was convinced when he sat down that he was going to do *something*, not necessarily to Akila, but the tension I felt came from the fact that I didn't know *what* he would do. 
That tension returned in the scene where he was telling the pups about cuckoo birds. My heart was beating so fast when that latter scene ended. One more detail.Remember the way Sher khan sits beside Akila on the cliff while talking to him.It was shown in a very natural way.I mean if you mute it or ignore the voice over thn it would look like some documentary from Discovery channel.If it had been some other movie Sher khan would have spoken face to face. Also when he put his paw infront of the pup, for a second I thought he was going to grab it in his jaws and break its neck or something.

R rated dreams, R rated dreams... A lot of people were bemoaning the fact that Shere Khan didn't sound ""cultured"" or refined like the animated version when the trailers hit, but Christ, Elba was magnificent.  Same with Scarlett; she did a great job, though the scene with Kaa was somewhat unnecessary overall. He was great.

The one thing I hated about Shere Khan was how he died from falling like a lot of Disney villains do (The Witch from Snow White, Maleficent, Ratigan, Gaston, etc.). It just felt cheap. In the original books he is stampeded; that would have been a way more awesome death. The casting all around was really incredible, but the choice of Elba as Shere Khan was outstanding, when I first heard him say his first line as Khan in the trailer I knew It was a perfect fit  Saw the movie in Hindi, the Indian voice actor Nana Patekar did an awesome job as well, as Sher Khan. My little sister actually cried during that scene, and it was so shocking.  Not to mention the vultures that were shown later picking on what I assume are Akila's ribs. I get why the writers had Shere Khan kill Akila, but moment really took me out of the movie because the pack did nothing. A tiger can't take a pack of wolves and they just sit back and let him get away with it. I think the part when he was talking to the Cubs disturbed me more The women beside me got up and left with her child when that happened. They did not come back.  But I knew as soon as Akela appeared that he was going to die, but his death scene came out of nowhere. Also the jump scare when shere khan was climbing the tree at the end was good Menacing and terrifying, Idris Elba has been menacing and terrifying for over a decade. I like that they didn't make it some dramatic death with Akila putting up an epic fight. As cool as that would have looked it wouldn't have had the same feeling of Shere Khan being a ruthless mofo. It sounded like his voice was gonna to give out when he sang too-oo-oo, but it felt so right. It would have been much better if there had been MORE COWBELLS!
But seriously, Walken was dead on awesome - 5/7 I actually much prefer the original to Walken's. His felt forced and didn't have close to the same effect the original had. I immediately looked up the original and listened on the way home, such a great song.  Meh, I miss Louis Prima. Nobody can do that song justice like he can.  It felt a bit awkward, compared to the 1960's Jungle Book . On the other hand, Bare Necessities was as good as the 1960's version Mowgli played with a cow bell just before he showed up.  After  I walked out of the theater I realized what had happened and shared a laugh with my girlfriend. King Louie is actually [based on a extinct species of ape called the Gigantopithecus](https://youtu.be/d6BWAXImPm0?t=2m4s) too, which is pretty cool. Stay for the end credits for some more awesome King Louie crooning. The world needs more of Christopher Walken's singing. Terrifying. I guarantee you that in coming years you'll hear stories of people who saw this as children and had nightmares for years after. It'll be like their version of the wolf (Gmork, whatever) from The Neverending Story. I *still* think about that horrible thing. How did I not realize this while watching it? That's amazing.  He felt like a mob boss. Really cool. The whole scene with him getting interrogating Mowgli for fire was basically a mob boss pissed off about not getting this months protection money. The movie did a good job of laying the groundwork for the finale. The elephants were part of that pay-off. It feels like everything prior to Shere Khan chasing Mowgli was given significant pay off.

The elephants in particular made me smile. That was effective storytelling. Papayas are overrated. Mangoes however are divine.   In India Elephants are revered. He is called the Universal God. Do you mean a pawpaw? It's the sound it makes when it hits the floor. I fully expect Disney to super stock papaya at their parks and make a fortune. Soon to turn the papaya industry into a behemoth money maker.  It kind of boggles my mind that you've never tried a papaya. They grow so easily and everywhere in Hawaii. 

Also, I love elephants.  When Baloo is just sort of humming it earlier in the movie I almost thought that that was all we were going to get of the song and maybe there'd be a full version at the end credits.

When they started completely bro-ing out to it on the river, I got misty-eyed and was tapping my toes like a motherfucker. Had a HUGE smile on my face during that entire scene. Felt like a kid again I think this was my favorite scene with Neel Sethi, incredible chemistry for a child actor on a sound stage. That scene with him riding Baloo in the river was amazing. I think it was SO fitting. It truly showed how savage and ruthless he was.  too soon qq Yup, that flipping book looked so good in 3D, my little sister looked in awe. 

Honestly Disney really pulled it off, and I'll be very very suprised if the Warner Bro's version can top this. Also, can we talk about how Walken says, ""You-oo-oo"" like a fucking monkey going ""oo-oo-oo."" It's perfection. Almost everyone at the showing I went to stayed for at least Walken's ""I Wanna Be Like You"". They loved the credits that much.

ScarJo singing ""Trust in Me"" was great too. Seriously, credits were so cool. I'd like to point out that King Louie doesn't exist in the books. The Bandar-log has no leader, structure, and doesn't even have a language. They just imitate the sounds of other animals which is something they really awesomely alluded to in this version. The Bandar-log aren't really sinister at all, either. They're just really dumb and inconsiderate, so they end up making trouble for the other animals.

I'd say they did as well with Louie in this one as with the original animated film. He's this crazy, powerful ape who believes the only real separation between him and man (or at least the authority of man) is that he doesn't know how to make fire. So he's try to get his hands on it despite the fact he doesn't have any clue how to use it and would likely burn down the entire jungle with it (kinda like how Mowgli did, but with more ""oooh""'s and ""aaaaah""s).

EDITY: Also, for those what didn't notice, in the scene directly after the Shere Khan cuckoo story - you see a mama bird of a much smaller species feeding a gigantic cuckoo chick in its nest. It's as they pan down the canopy. The songs were mixed in *just enough* to remind you without slamming the movie to a halt.

What really impressed me was how John Debney weaved the songs (and the original score) into the movie's score so seamlessly. As soon as I heard that beautiful oboe solo at the beginning, I knew we were in good hands; and he did it all throughout the movie. I think we have our Best Visual Effects Oscar winner there. I know it's early but I don't see how any movie can beat it, they look more real than real life (and the landscapes too).  best TL;DR summary. You da real MVP The songs were an absolute must.  That is part of the fabric of the original.  Very well done. I completely agree. I was so relieved to go to a movie that was under two hours. In an age where blockbusters just meander on and on unnecessarily for 160 minutes, I admired its compact, economical storytelling. For such a large-scale picture, it felt really intimate.

Also, I appreciate having a genuine music score in a movie and not the ominous and forgettable ""mood music"" most movies try to pass off as a score. faved for the TLDR amen brotha Couldnt have said it better. I found it easier to identify with the animals than Mowgli, that wasn't an accident  Which is so ironic considering the moral of the original film seemed a lot more geared towards ""stay with your own kind"" types of beliefs. Times have changed. I love how Baghera comes to realize how Mowgli is unique. He realizes that the kid is something special. He's brave, caring, and wise when he helps the elephants. What a beautiful evolution! 
 you do you, don't try to fit in, just be who you are=] I also really appreciated how it wasn't a black or white decision. Mowgli and the jungle both compromise somewhat when it comes to his tricks. Remember, even though the jungle is thankful to him, they are still wary of the red flower.  

Also, if you remember the final scene, Mowgli is sitting with Baggy and Baloo in the tree apart from the wolf pack. My impression was that everyone had come to accept the fact that he wasn't wolf, but that was okay too. Why? Did he have a fever? That whole dialogue between Baloo and the other animals was genius.

The ""endangered species"" line might be my favorite in the whole movie, next to Baloo telling Mowgli that his poem was propaganda. That pig's [Jon Favreau](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm0269463/?ref_=m_ttfcd_cl18) the director, at least I'm pretty sure Between this, Zootopia and apparently Civil War, Disney has one hell of a year quality wise (and commercially but it's always the case) for now. Hope it continues (Dory, Strange and Rogue One being the ones I'm more interested in being great).  The CGI animals looked way better than real life animals. I'm seriously impressed. Also you know, if this whole acting thing doesn't pan out for Idris Elba he could always have a career voicing Disney animals. I loved him as Shere Khan. I had the same tought after watching, about seeing it the second time! I had the privilege of seeing it in a brand new cinema aswell. There's no IMAX here where I live, but I saw it in this so called [SCAPE](http://www.scape.lv) cinema experience that just opened in the biggest theatre here. It has a 4K Laser projector and a new Dolby Atmos sound system.

That link is in Latvian language though, but here is the info:

>The Scape Auditorium is equipped with the only Barco 4K laser projector in the Baltic as well as Nordic countries - DP4K–60L. It offers superior image quality with an exceptional brightness level, increased contrast ratio and vivid colors for a radically improved (3D) movie experience.

> The incredibly powerful new generation Dolby Atmos sound system CP850 delivers sound through the total of 87 loudspeakers, reaching the cinemagoer from five different directions – from the ceiling as well as the walls. All sounds, music and speech move in the auditorium so that you will feel as if you were in the film yourself with all the action happening around you.

> The new auditorium is not only a joy for the eyes but a pleasant experience for all senses. Spacious premium class leather seats, allow you to lose yourself in the cinema auditorium and dive into the cinematic world.

As far as I know, this is better than most IMAX screens since they haven't really introduced this technology in their cinemas, only recently they opened the 1st one of this scale in europe.

Based on one of the greatest coming of age books ever. Before Lion King there was a book by Mr. Kipling.  Shere Khan thought that Mowgli would use the fire to his advantage, which he does, and then he learns his lesson by throwing the fire into the pond. This means that Mowgli didn't turn into the man that Shere Khan thought he would turn into. Shere Khan was just bitter towards man for getting his face burnt, so he wanted Mowgli killed. Shere Khan also hunted for sport, which was against the law of the land (or at least that's how I interpreted it), which means that Shere Khan cares more about himself than he does about the forest. Shere Khan wasn't the tragic hero, he was the evil villain with a valid but wrong argument. **OKAY GUYS COME ON LET'S PHONEBANK FOR KHAN! SEEONEE PRIMARIES ARE COMING UP QUICKLY!** He killed an innocent man, fire hurt him on accident, blames everyone but himself for it. What a hero. Definitely resembles a Greek tragedy. Shere Khan fears Mowgley will use fire to kill him, and through his actions to prevent that, he makes it happen  Yep this was my first thought. Maybe Mowgli turned out to be cool, but the animals would have been right to fear and hate man in general. Shere Khan was playing it safe. I love this post, as it has a little truth in it, but is so over the top that it makes me laugh. Andrew, you are a genius. Mowgli wouldn't have brought the fire back if he didn't hear that Shere Khan was hanging around threatening his pack Kaa felt more like a cameo... A pretty important one though since she told the story of his father's death.  > I don't have any problem if Disney took this approach for their upcoming live-action adaptations. It is a success with this movie and Cinderella. This approach may straight forward but they added some dimensions and properly executed those movie.

Having directors with great ambition (Branagh and Favreau) really helped as well. I hope they continue with people like them instead of using directors-for-hire. The 3D does make the movie feel very alive, and in IMAX 3D the sheer scale of King Louie and the luscious jungle is amazing. It's interesting because I was the opposite as a kid. I was never interested in The Jungle Book and the only time I saw clips of it were in the Disney Sing a Longs. And I even fast forwarded those when I could. 

Now, as an adult, I realize it is a great story that isn't just about a boy living in the jungle. I really enjoyed watching it. The CGI was amazing. There was one scene when I couldn't stop watching the muscle movement on Shere Khan. 

Sometimes I felt like I was just watching the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet. Felt so real. 

There was a girl sitting next to me in the theater, and she ended up whining (really loudly) about how she hated the movie and wanted to leave. Her father looked so annoyed but they left mid-movie. Felt bad for him :( not sure if it's ""fun for all ages, great kid movie"" material.. Maybe she wasn't old enough? Meh.. *shrug* Scarlett Johanssen's scene fills two roles. First, it tells Mowgli's backstory. Second it puts Mowgli's in Balloo's debt.  I liked Scarlett as Kaa, but I agree, the entire scene was unnecessary.  Someday someone will do a Jungle Book that does right by Kaa instead of just making him the bad guy. :( neel sethi was absolutely amazing.  a kid putting on that performance is mind blowing. Johansson's rendition of ""Trust in Me"" was produced by Mark Ronson and appears in the end credits only. The scene feels much shorter because they cut that from the film.
 I thought his acting was terrible. Took me out of the movie.  It might be because I haven't watched a movie with a child lead in a while but some of his delivery was just so cheesy.  I loved her voice acting in Her, and I still think she did a good job as Kaa, but the majority of the comments here seemed to hate her  I loved how the camera transitioned from her eye to the cave.

Edit: Do we still call it a camera if it's all made in a computer?  Whoa whoa whoa. *Everything?* How can you not like Bill Murray as Baloo??  I agree. It wasn't that I thought Bill Murray wasn't great, I think was the fact his personality seemed the most far removed from the original Baloo and I guess it just threw me off. As I said, it's no criticism of Murray, I just felt like this Baloo was the character least reminiscent of its predecessor.  That was the only thing I  could think about. A good dose of the mystique of Godfather too. Very Marlon Brando esque character. This x1000. I would love to see Rikki remade in the same fashion. > ""I Wanna be Like You"" also felt quite forced and tonally awkward (Louie was all angry and intimidating while this boppy music played up...?).

This. Couldnt agree more. Most people here thought it was the best part of the movie, but it seriously made me cringe. (i love the original btw) I agree ""I Wanna be Like You"" was a bit awkward, but I think this comes from them trying to sidestep the issue with the animated version, where the monkeys were racist depictions of jive-talking monkey trying to ""be like men."" They got around this by turning King Louie into a mobster instead of a black caricature, but they were also trying to be true to the original music score, so the jazzy boppy tune was retained. It's an interesting argument for sure. 

Here's how I took it: Mowgli was always told what made men evil was that they manipulated nature (through fire most notoriously) and that's why his ""tricks"" were forbidden by the wolves and Bagheera. Then, when he was with Baloo, his ""tricks"" were appreciated for the first time because he helped Baloo and some of the other animals eat. 

When Bagheera found out, he still looked down on the tricks, because this manipulation of nature just enabled gluttony, but then Mowgli proved himself again by saving the young elephant stuck in the pit. Mowgli was then convinced he could use his ""human powers"" of manipulating his surroundings and use fire to take down Sherkahn. 

Of course, he ended up burning down half the jungle on accident instead and beat Sherkahn just by uniting the rest of the animals against him, but afterwards the elephants dammed the river to redirect water and put out the fires. To me, this showed that the elephants also knew how to manipulate nature the way that humans do, but are wise enough to reserve that ""power"" and only use it when it helps everyone and not just for personal gain. That is why they are the most respected animal in the jungle and humans are the most feared. They have equal power to manipulate their surroundings, but different ideas about their responsibility to take care of nature and other animals.

Not to say the movie implied humans are just naturally evil and selfish. I think it's just kind of that the animals had only heard bad stories of Man and so Mowgli walks the line and has to choose between only using his ""power"" for self gain or for the greater good like the elephants. 
 #sherekhanwasright But he's a massive dick himself with him killing just for sport and malice. So no one really took his self-serving lectures seriously. Probably depends, but I went with my whole family and the youngest of the bunch was 9 years old, and she loved it aswell. > a sandwich of dark and scary

So, like every Disney cartoon ever? >They Disneyfied Disney. Seriously. It drove me NUTS that Mowgli gets to stay in the jungle. The whole point of the story is that he HAS to leave because it isn't safe - not just for him, but for the rest of the animals. Man is not compatible with the jungle, nor is the jungle compatible with man. I would have thought there was a good conservationist moral to be made there, in a fun, and inspiring way, but they totally missed it...

They didn't ""totally miss it"", they made the far more important assertion that you don't have to change yourself to fit in. I mean that was Mowgli and Bagheera's entire character arc, that the latter gradually came to appreciate the former's ""tricks"" as something that were part of him and a *good* part of him at that, from getting bears honey to saving elephant calves. 

In the cartoon he doesn't leave because it's not safe, he leaves because something something hot chick flirted with him. Which is honestly just stupid. In the original he doesn't leave the jungle for good until he's seventeen, long after the events of the first book.

>Likewise, although I LOVED Elba's performance, I am one of the few unhappy with the fact that his accent wasn't standardised RP. I thought by having him sound like a cultured aristocrat, there could have been some interesting comments made about British Imperialism.

Why do you feel the need to otherize Shere Khan? The tiger is *the* symbol of India. As in, its national animal. Shere Khan is as much a part of the jungle as any of the other animals. There's nothing foreign about the tiger king. Or do you think India has no history of oppressors or power dynamics beyond the British?

The Jungle Book is not a Western tale. It's a bit sad that you'd only be able to see depth in it if it was connected to Western-influenced history.

>ALSO Kaa - Kaa is totally shoehorned in. Why not, at the end of the story, reveal that Kaa slithered up, and devoured Mowgli's father, thus giving her presence there a purpose, and making her complicit in Mowgli's disenfranchisement?

Do...you know anything about Kaa? He's Mowgli's mentor and friend. I realize this film tried to strike a balance between the book and the cartoon, but frankly I'm glad they didn't butcher her character any more than the 1967 adaptation did. I much prefer her portrayal here, where she's a bank of a century's worth of knowledge like the original, and Mowgli (albeit inadvertently) goes to her for wisdom.

Also I have no idea how eating a corpse makes her complicit in anything. Unless you're suggesting she could have brought his father back to life somehow? In regards to the ending, it's most likely because the original ending of Mowgli going back to his own kind pretty much eradicated the moral of the story which is that you don't have to stay with your own kind to fit in and have a family A *live action* Winnie the Pooh?! He didn't kill Sher Khan with fire. He killed him with his ""tricks"".  I disagree. Neel Sethi acting was on point.  Have you seen the 60's cartoon? It almost seems like Neel Sethi jumped right out of the cartoon. I hated the ending.

The original cartoon had a perfect bittersweet ending, really disappointed they didn't use it. I agree, it's probably a 5/10 for me cause outside of the visuals it did nothing for me.

EDIT: Come on lads, don't just down-vote me cause I didn't like it. > this movie is just okay

What would you rate it, a 6/10? If so, and if 94% of reviewers felt the same way, that's a 94% on RT. RT's scores are not ratings, they are the % of people that gave a positive review. I agree. Child actor was quite bad. Also felt that the way in which king louie commenced his song broke the tone of the scene. Weirdly enough the credits are worth the 3D alone. The rest of the movie is great in 3D, but the credits are just beautiful with depth. I think Louie's song was like that on purpose. If you think about he tone of their conversation he was already going back and forth between menacingly implying things and being ""friendly"" to convince the mowgli. Even the song itself is given off as menacing at points and blatantly so. So blatant in fact that mowgli who is kind of easy to trick and manipulate throughout the movie can see something is up, gets uncomfortable, and feels the need to leave. exactly how i felt I feel like you can't just say,""well he's just a kid actor"" because there's been some really great talent at young ages. Sure he looked the part, but I didn't buy him really. He was trumped by the entire cast who was amazing. Still loved the film, just didn't enjoy him as much as I'd hoped Yeah I think it was really well done. I share your sentiment with the child actor, he was one of the biggest faults I had with this film but in fairness he wasn't terrible. He really had is work cut out for him though.

I would hardly say the story is weak, nothing revolutionary but certainly not weak. It has been a while since I've read The Jungle Book but I don't know how many female characters are in the original stories. The Bare Necessities was badly done and I think Murray wasn't a good Baloo but I think Walken did well.

It isn't a masterpiece (although the CG work is near perfect) but it is still a brilliant film imo. This thread made me psyched about a movie I didn't want to see at all. [deleted] Aladdian! Its a pun so it's Bare Necessities  Don't think I'd go that far, but it was good. He ded. The elephants reroute the river to extinguish the flames and Mowgli hangs out with Baloo and Bagheera. They did. Lol its okay man it happens to the best of us Yes! I came here to see if anyone else thought that was similar. Took my six year old to see this movie and was blown away. Loved the whole thing.  [deleted] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN62KrzzVIU King Louie is played by Christopher Walken and he was in a famous skit on SNL which involved a cowbell. At points he was great. However there were certainly a few scenes where he was a bit rough. More than good enough and didnt ruin the film but if we are being honest he wasnt some sort of perfect child actor.  The kid from The Last Airbender wants to have a word with you...

/s Speaking of that scene, I loved the little lick he gave Baloo after the words of encouragement too. Yes please. I really believe that this studio could do it justice.  They have the technology. 


I'm up for them redoing all the good animated Disney films. 


Someone said that they saw something that looked like the lamp from Aladdin in the film. 


Anyone else want a Disney cinematic universe?  I don't think my body is ready... I am so down.  I'd settle for them just doing the Circle of Life opening sequence as a VR experience. [deleted] Protip, never leave at least until the credits go to the regular black scrolling (which even then isn't always sound advice if you're at like a Marvel movie). *Just* left the movie, and yeah I was stunned. I thought he just sat down, said 'Welp, that's done then' only to leave, turn around and make a threat but nope. Full on murder. Girl next to me literally knocked over her water. Everyone in my theater audibly gasped when that happened. Shere Khan don't play. There were a lot of jump scare moments. It would be interesting to see a Jon Favreau horror/suspense film.  BE prepaaaaaared. Yeah I was like damn....this shit is PG? [deleted] Best moment of the movie was when he stopped the last pup, held eye contact with the mother, then let it go. Terrific villain writing. I think the scene with the pups was made so much intense by the fact that we had seen him kill Akila earlier. I had to keep telling myself that they wouldn't do anything to the pups since this was a PG movie, but my mind kept going back to what happened to Akila and created doubt. Seriously. Just came from the theatre. LOVE how realistic the animal behavior was. Amazing movie! The chase bit at the end where Bagheera goes after Shere Khan - could have sworn they took it from the nature channel!
 You should read Fables. I thought it was a good way to introduce Baloo, kickstarting their relationship by having Mowgli be indebted to him. Shere was almost too cultured in the cartoon. Like just some smarmy Britishman dandy being selfish.

Shere on this movie looked like he had conviction and reason behind his anger and evil. He felt dignified in his strength, but also pure evil and selfish without being just aloof. It was actually decently necessary because it introduced Shere Khan and Mowgli's backstory, along with Mowgli's father (and the reason behind Khan's anger and revenge).  Sure, that could've been dealt with in another way, but I'll take a sultry Scarlett voice any time I can.  Looking back at it, it kinda demonstrates just how powerful the ""red flower"" is one final time. Literally no one could stand up to him except that Disney Death. It's its own trope.  It's an acceptable form of death probably in the, for kids but not really, entertainment culture. Having the animal die from a stampede might have been too much for the focus groups.

Plus falling to your death is a really....pathetic death so it's more of an insult. Granted I haven't seen the movie. He just suddenly turned into fire sparks upon hitting the ground...like c'mon. We saw a wolf get flung from a mountain, you can show us something. But he fell into the fire, which is a major theme in the movie. I don't see how that's cheap. And having him be too heavy for the branches was cool. I haven't read the book, but I can't see how being crushed under a stampede works as well as the end to a final confrontation. Hans Gruber ending too. Not just any tiger. Its shere khan.. *baloo shocked face* Wolves in India are smaller than your normal North American wolves. A pack of wolves would have not been able to take on a full grown enraged Bengal Tiger. A tigers ferocity is unmatched. i think that was intentional ....when apes or monkeys are often portrayed as going ""oo oo"" There already was cowbell!   
You have a fever for more?! Well he isn't a singer and this wasn't really a musical.  Nobody can scat about being a monkey who wants to be a person like Louis Prima. Kid I got cowbells... My cowbells got cowbells... Son. Of. A. Bitch... I am admittedly terrible at references and callbacks, but I did not realize the significance until right now. I feel like such a mook. Guess what kid, I've a got a fever... and the only prescription is man's red flower! Nah... needs more cowbells Oh shit , that is awesome Clearly King Louie had a fever! What's cool about that change is that now all the animals featured in this movie are now all from India. 

Orangoutangs are not native to india but at least gigantopithecus was, which is why I love the change. Oh he's an amazing dancer in singer, most people don't realize it. He did a Fat Boy Slim music video, where he legit danced in the movie and it was pretty good. I mean, he did say he could ""protect"" Mowgli If you think about the elephants in the cartoon, they are more of a joke reference that might have been a bit funny in the 60s.

These elephants *feel* like elephants. Guardians of the jungle. Their significance in this movie was huge, vs the cartoon version's veteran parade. 

I think this change from the cartoon may be hinting towards the sequel that has been announced. Maybe Mowgli meets the girl (as the cartoon ends), integrates, and then learns the elephants will be hunted? 

edit: also I had to cheek wipe when Mowgli saved Hathi from the pit. +1000000000


nothing comes close to a fresh mango. a fresh paw-paw or papaya can be juicy and sweet and a refreshing relief from tropical heat, but it is not a 'come-to-Jesus' moment. 



but holy crap a fresh mango from the tropics... so messy and juicy and incredible. maybe one of the greatest, simplest treats on the planet. Are you referring to the deity *Ganesha*? Aren't all animals? Indian here. Real talk though, I never realised that pawpaw and papaya were the same thing until he said that. Papaya is meh. But put it into a milshake and its all kinds of amazin I love how they incorporated the song into the movie. It's not like they were breaking out in song like the classic animated Disney films. They were both just chillin', floating down a nice river, singing a good tune. It felt completely natural and, for lack of a better word, realistic. > Honestly Disney really pulled it off

Just think about this. This is the list of the movies Disney has released since last summer:

- Inside Out
- Ant-Man
- Bridge of Spies
- The Good Dinosaur
- Star Wars: The Force Awakens
- The Finest Hours
- Zootopia
- The Jungle Book

Oh and their next release is some indie film called, Captain America: Civil War.

I mean The Good Dinosaur and The Finest Hours are the two ""weakest"" films out of that list.

Say what you will about them as a corporation, but holy shit they have made some great, great decisions and released damn fine films recently, whether it be their subsidiaries (Lucasfilm, Pixar, or Marvel) or they themselves with Zootopia & Jungle Book. It's based on the original song from the cartoon...so that wasn't new it sounded like a Bond song, loved it Wow, well said (and great to know)! I could have sworn I remember him in the book, although it was read as a child so I guess I just inserted that into my memory. Thank you for your reply :) I thought the only part where the songs raised my brow was when King Louie was being all mafia boss menacing then he started singing. Like, the performance was pretty awesome and the inclusion of the song didn't bother me, I just felt like the Bare Necessities song was woven so seamlessly into the movie and I Wanna Be Like You was more blatant. But I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and loved hearing the songs pop up. I loved the VFX as much as you do but I don't know if it'll win the Oscar.

Remember when Transformers lost to The Golden Compass? Or Iron Man lost to Benjamin Button? Or when Ex Machina won last month?

The Academy doesn't usually give the award to movies that have a TON of CGI. Avatar was an exception. If only he had some kind of prescription for it. That line was hilarious. I also loved Bagheera's ""I *don't eat* honey."" I loved that line in the moment, definitely laughed out loud. Looking back though, it doesn't make any sense that Baloo would know what an endangered species is. I don't mean to nitpick, but it does break the diegesis. Still clever though That line was actually improvised by Bill Murray, and wasn't in the script. There was only me and three small families that saw it early matinee today. I heard a kid ask, ""mom, what is propaganda?""

I couldnt hear her response, but i wouldnt even know how to answer that or make something up on the spot Yep, all those animals were voiced by directors: Jon Favreau, Spike Jonze, and Sam Raimi I think. I lost my shit when Baloo picks up the pig and it freaks the fuck out. Honestly, Disney is such a great company. I hate corporate bullshit and Disney's guilty of just about everything, but it is an extremely well run company that stands by its products and doesn't compromise quality for shameless cash grabs. If more companies could be more like Disney, I wouldn't have as many issues with how business is done. Pixar showed the first 27 minutes of FD at Comic Con and it was instantly compared to the 7 minute opening montage of Up. That's pretty much got me sold.  And don't forget **Moana**, that comes out in November Don't forget the new Star Wars movie too. I want Idris Elba to narrate my entire life after this movie ""You wouldn't LISTEN to reason, so now you know fear!""

His new ""cancelling the apocalypse"" line. I was surprised when reading a couple reviews he didn't have a higher billing for his work as Shere Khan. Across the board this movie had incredible casting and choices, but I think Idris as Shere Khan was really perfect  You won't regret it! It's fantastic  The whole post is a bit of a joke, but one thing really did bother me. Mowgli throws the fire into the pond and then proceeds to kill Shere Khan with fire. That bit seemed to entirely counter to everything Mowgli had supposedly learned. He became exactly what Shere Khan said he would be. **I JUST DONATED THE MONEY I HAD SET ASIDE FOR MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO KHAN! MATCH ME REDDIT!** I mean, fire burnt him on purpose in an altercation with an intruder to the jungle. Khan consistently tries to protect the forest, but is made out to be a villain because he is a predator. In fact, the fear of Man is the binding force of the Law of the Jungle! Yeah, it was only one scene, but I felt like Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job and couldn't have done it any better. The way she said ""Trussst in me"" was so soothing, yet suspenseful, and made you feel like she couldn't wait to have that meal. I think Kaa was supposed to have her own song, Johansson's rendition of ""Trust in Me"" was produced by Mark Ronson and appears in the end credits only. The fathers death was the one thing I didn't like. You didn't need t tie Shere Khan into Mowgli (and apparently have Kaa and SK both know about it). Just have Shere Khan be a tiger who was hurt by humans and now wants to kill any he finds. Plus the flashback made him way less sympathetic since he initiated the encounter with the father and got burned in the process.  The irony being they were both director's for hire with Marvel. Kaa scared the shit out of me in imax 3d. I felt properly hypnotised by the scale of her Gah I really want to see it in 3D. My experience with 3D movies has always been meh. Was the 3D in this actually 3D? lol I'll come out and say something I seriously never expected:  I saw what they were going for in the Ghostbusters trailer when I saw it in 3d.   


I still have the same problems with the jokes, but the 3d really had an impressive depth and richness really sold the trailer in a way that the 2d version seriously lacked.   The ghost especially are vastly improved by the depth and shading.  



   Still looks like a rough slog but it was eye opening. A scene can drive a plot forward and still feel out of place... They added in the flashback bit, which made her pretty mystical and cool. I didn't think they would include the pulsating eyes in the movie. I liked it. I think at this point no one knows the story of the book and the Disney version is what people think of, so making Kaa a good guy again would be quite diffcult and probably not be well received *at first*. I'm sure it could be done well though. Personally, I liked the story having three villains and Kaa's scene was a good way to introduce Baloo, I felt.

As someone who hasn't read the book,  how is Kaa like as Mowgli's friend? And what sort of things does he do with Mowgli? Again, I give it a grain of salt because he was acting across literally nothing. I don't know why. Even if you didn't like her, she wasn't in the movie for very long John Goodman would have been better.

But Bill was great too. ikr! Loved him, so loveable,had me chucklin the whole time Baloo was definitely miscast

He was one of my favorite characters of the original film and maybe of all the Disney cartoons

So fun loving yet so genuine

Baloo in this one comes off as a quirky con artist uncle with a soft spot

Murray did a great job giving it a unique twist but I wanted the Baloo of old

I really enjoyed this movie and absolutely can NOT wait for Aladdin, Winnie the Pooh, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and of course, Lion King.

I did not enjoy Cinderella but thought Maleficent was great Your argument is one of the reasons why I think that the 2016's adaptation of the Jungle Book is much better than the 1967's one, if one dares to take away the nostalgic glasses . I had to read that three times to see it as anything besides ""Shrek han was right"" I think people tend to underestimate kids these days. I agree that would have killed the movie for me [deleted] I thought his acting as definitely weak at points but you gotta keep in mind he's an inexperienced actor acting against a bunch of animals and setting that aren't there.  I'd say 5/10. Wouldn't quite say actor was bad. He'll probably knock it out of the park in a traditional movie. He just needed more takes for green screen and a better script. James Monroe Iglehart is pretty good and has made the role his own on Broadway.

 Aladeen! The pun would be ""Bear necessities"" because it's literally talking about the bare necessities of life, but he's a bear. [removed] To be fair, has there ever been a perfect kid actor of that age? For me, that added to it. It doesn't have to be right for everyone, but I loved that he wasn't perfect; it gave the character a rougher feel, like he actually was just a kid out in the jungle. Aladdin would be intense. All the magic with the Genie would be like drugs. 

Beauty and the Beast would be nice.  [deleted] I actually liked Kaa's song too. Scarlett's voice is... sexy. It was cool how they sat down to talk and everything was so natural. They even added the ear twitch and I felt like I was watching them at the zoo or something Pretty sure that's why he threw him off the cliff rather than snapped his neck. I love how that action was essentially him letting the mother know how easily he could kill them all.  ""I think they like me."" Oh, you, Shere Khan. Without Tabaqui in the story, *nobody* likes you. Seeing how big Kaa was, I was amazed that Baloo was able to fend her off. I think the best example of how ridiculously dandy Shere Khan is in the original animated film is the scene where he's asking Kaa if he has seen Mowgli (which he has, it's just after the Trust in Me song) and Kaa attempts to hypnotize Shere Khan - who responds by swatting Kaa's head down and saying ""Ah, no. I can't be bothered with that, I simply don't have the time, old fellow."" Yeah, in the cartoon he's a bit too mustache-twirly. This version's more believable. Are you talking about TailSpin? The elephants could have. Clayton's death in 'Tarzan' was pretty rough for a Disney film. I mean, Mufasa had both happen to him. It really played Mowgli's inventiveness to it so it worked wonderfully. There was no way they would allow showing him skewer Shere. They could have just let Shere Khan survive like in the animated film. Yeah I agree. I didn't mind the death. It was Mowgli's way of being able to kill a big fucking tiger that is stronger, faster, etc. It was the ""man cub"" way of dealing with a huge threat, and added validity to the use of his ""tricks."" MIND BLOWN. Yes, that's the reason it's in the song. That doesn't mean it was intentional that his voice sounded a bit worse in those parts. There's no way that wasn't an intentional Easter egg.  And he was MUCH scarier than the original to make up for it Bitches love cowbells. still don't get it, could you explain it to me please? Really? I was convinced that a lot of the fauna were non-native! I don't think Baloo is unfortunately. I think the type they use is a Himalayan bear. [If you've only seen him dance in that video though, you owe yourself the favor](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=54iR0xFkEfQ) [deleted] >  also I had to cheek wipe when Mowgli saved Hathi from the pit.

I miss in-theater toilets. >saved Hathi

Fun fact: ""hathi"" in Hindu/Urdu literally means ""elephant."" So when you say ""Hathi the elephant,"" you're saying ""elephant the elephant.

Same situation with baloo: ""Bhaloo"" means ""bear."" One time I was up all night rolling at a music festival, and at like 7am, completely drained, I walk over to the food place just hoping to get some coffee to get my head straight.  And what do I see......the Indian food stall had left out their leftover Mango Lassi from the day before with a little ""Free"" sign next to it!  Mango Lassi has got to be in the top ten ways to end a trip! Papaya is really best when still green, I hate ripen papaya, but green papaya stripes rock with every salad you put them in. Reddit needs a Multi-upvote button
 dude loves mangos I believe he is when he says Universal God, but as an animal elephants are historically very revered Bridge of Spies was Disney? The Finest Hours is a classic feel-good Disney movie. It didn't break new ground by any means but it was well acted, written and directed. Although I do believe it was their first flop of 2016. I'm so excited for Through the Looking Glass, Finding Dory, and The BFG (Disney's next 3 movies after Civil War). The way Walken emphasizes the ""oo-oo"" is very different from Prima's more ""You-hoo-hoo"" diction. No problem! In the Kipling books, all the animals that are portrayed are native to India (at least those involved in the stories there - there's some stories that aren't about the Jungle like *The White Seal* and the story about the qiqirn in *Jungle Book 2*) which rules out orangutans. 

The original writer for the '67 animated film written by Bil Peet included an allegedly darker version of the Bandar-log (but we'll never know in what way) but when he left the project the part was more or less written for the legendary scat-man Louis Prima which is crazy in a much more lighthearted way. I think this version is probably closer to whatever Peet had planned with Louie being a mob-boss type. What with his casual sort of ""Throw him off the cliff."" attitude. I was half-expecting him to crush the tiny monkey that was grooming his forearm hair when he tossed it off. That was the only time I was pulled out of the movie by the singing. It was great just threw me off a bit. Same here! The Bare Necessities singing seemed organic and I could accept it, but King Louie was so threatening then all of a sudden he's jazz singing? It threw me off. But it's one of my only minor complaints of the whole movie though! Exactly. I wanted more songs but only if they were as seamlessly integrated like Bear Necessities. I wanna be like you was more awkwardly introduced in my opinion.  The Bear Necessities scene was one of the happiest moments I've had in a long time watching a movie. Interesting, I Wanna Be Like You/the whole scene with King Louie and the Bandar-Log was easily one of my favourite parts of the film! I'm not a guy who cares for musicals, but I thought the song worked perfectly the way they did it. You already suspend some belief watching a movie with talking animals, and only have to suspend it a little bit more when he starts singing IMO. > Or when Ex Machina won last month?

That was a legit win. Who was robbed? I instantly thought of honey roasted ham, I thought that's where the joke was going *exfoliate me* The catch 22 is that they can afford to take their time on their projects. And make sure it's 110% before approving it or else binning it. Others literally can't afford that luxury What the hell is FD *Cinema Con. Comic Con is in the summer.  Well, if you excuse me, I think I'll go buy my ticket now. I hope it's better than the trailer.  They played one before Jungle Book and it was some generic and boring stuff. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it. I think its gonna be on Frozen's level He didn't ""Gay_Wolverine got high this morning and... oh look... he's going on reddit again"" The 'cancelling the apocalypse' line didn't catch on because it was good, it was because it was such a stupid line and he still delivered it with a seriousness and determination.  Still my favorite Elba quote is his '40 degree days' quote from The Wire.  
  
>That’s like a 40-degree day. Ain’t nobody got nothing to say about a 40-degree day. Fifty. Bring a smile to your face. Sixty, shit, niggas is damn near barbecuing on that motherfucker. Go down to 20, niggas get their bitch on. Get their blood complaining. But forty? Nobody give a fuck about 40. Nobody remember 40, and *y‘all niggas is giving me way too many 40-degree days!* The fall from that height might have been fatal without the fire. Hard to know for sure, but at that point Mowgli was using his resourcefulness to save his life: his knowledge of trees, skills in building contraptions, and fooling the hunter into pouncing at him on a weak branch.  The thing about that scene is that Khan could have turned back. He knew the branch was gonna break - he kept hesitating and looking down at it. He ultimately damned himself because he could not let this man-cub stand up to him. Mowgli just had to save himself and let Khan's rage destroy him.

Stay away from the fire, Khan, and you won't get burned.  I guess he could have just battled it out with him claws vs claws... Haha. But seriously, thats probably why they went the red flower route.. He stood no chance against him otherwise **QUICK GUYS! KHAN'S OPPONENTS ARE HOLDING RALLIES! GET THEM!** Keep in mind other predators (the wolves) hate him as well because he kills for sport, which is against the law of the jungle. I want her to whisper it in my ear at night time They made great use of the surround sound when she's talking off-screen.  Her voice kept moving around the theater.  I really wanted to hear this song in the movie. The scene was well done anyway and I love that Kaa's eyes changed color, hypnotizing Mowgli, but I really wanted to hear Scar Jo sing this song in that scene as well. The movie was still fantastic.  And it was fantastic. God, she's got an amazing voice. Shere khan isn't supposed to be sympathized with. He's evil and spiteful(hunting for sport and terrorizing the other animals during peace times) youre never supposed to like him as a person at any point in this. Some of the best 3D I've ever seen. But I'm already a big fan of 3D.

What I love about 3D is how it can add texture to items. Smoke seems more smokey. Hair seems more hairy. Trees are more barky. Animal fur is more furry. This movie absolutely begs to be seen in 3D because the CGI on the animals and in the background is that good.  Ah. I was commenting on you saying the scene was unnecessary.  I think that's the problem. She was fantastic, but her scene was so short that it was just like, whelp, she sure was in it! that would be pretty cool for sure ""I'm going to fight for my home where I was raised and where my friends live."" ""Hey look, a hot babe."" ""Well, I might as well leave all of that behind."" 

Thank god that ending was removed http://i.imgur.com/bpN2JNq.gifv Hmm you're right actually!  He's kind of made a career out of that I completely agree. Especially with him working next to a green screen must have been hard. I think he was great and as good as he could be. I am just saying if we are being honest there were a few scenes where it was like yeah this is a child actor and this is all we can hope for. 

The best I believe was Haley Joel Osment. Though I completely believe that he was being given something or had some sort of disease that makes him look like a kid for much longer than he should. I know that sounds crazy I completely agree but if you look at him now he is just a tall person with a kids face. He doesnt look right. Hell of an actor 10 years ago though.  Sure, Tatum O'Neill, or the girl from True Grit whose name I can't spell. Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver.

EDIT: Or that kid from Room. I'm not so sure of that age, but the child actors in The Visit (a little older, though, mind you) are brilliant. Also, Emily Browning and Dakota Fanning were damn good when they were little tots as sell. Beauty and the Beast would be great! They could cast Emma Watson as Belle, Luke Evans as Gaston, Ewan McGregor as Lumière, and Ian Mckellen as Cogsworth!  But man.. you can't do the Genie with out our main dude Robin Williams...

Now I'm sad. haha Have you seen the movie *her*? 

Hngggg That was so awesome. I actually kind of laughed when the Tiger just plopped down like a normal tiger would. 

What really got me was when Bagheera and Shere Khan were fighting in the end, it actually looked like how these two animals might fight. When Bagheera got flipped on his back he started using his hind leg claws to kick Shere Khan in the face. Thats actually how cats, big and small, fight.  I totally saw it coming once Shere realized the wolves were hiding the information and apparently a deal hadn't been met fully. But even then, that scene felt like it came out of nowhere. Just masterful direction and choreography of the animal animation. Not to mention the music built up the tension with Shere obviously cozying up on purpose. I was afraid for the wolf leader when he sat down too. Just incredible use of body language in this film. huh, [Today I learned](http://junglebook.wikia.com/wiki/Tabaqui). I should read the book :)  Even the biggest snakes aren't fighters, especially without venom. No snake could withstand a bear.  I half expected the elephants to come in last minute to save Mowgli like the eagles in LOTR Elephants don't play  i was thinking throughout the entire final scene how they would get the elephants in but it never happened and i got sad I miss Disney's ""G-Rated"" Movies in 90s Ha, when Mowgli escaped Shere Khan by running through the buffalo stampede, I leaned over to my girlfriend and whispered, ""He's about to get Mufasa'd!"" Too soon, man... Too soon...

Take your upvote, covered in the blood of a king. Yeah, but no one pays us millions of dollars to make that decisio. One of the best ever Saturday Night Live sketches is Christopher Walken interrupting the band Blue Oyster Cult while they're recording 'Don't Fear the Reaper' because he wants more cowbell in the song (with Will Ferrell playing the cowbell) a famous SNL skit with Christopher Walken and the phrase ""more cowbell"" https://vimeo.com/55624839

Found it for you. Enjoy! You can see all the animals shown in the movie in Indian forests. You may not be able to see all of them at a single place though. We've learned since that elephants are smart. Really fucking smart. Maybe not human smart, but close. How smart? After they were nearly hunted to extinction, when their populations started to rebound, elephants were known to stampede over everything, giving no fucks. What happened? Elephants had a culture, and a sense of right and wrong that was passed down from generation to generation. When the elder elephants were killed off, the younger ones grew up without such guidance and acted like delinquents. It could take generations to rebuild the elephant culture.

If anyone gave the animals the law of the jungle in real life, it'd be the elephants. In the Indian context, elephants are revered, even seen aa holy Yeah they're undeniably regal Maybe this thought is part of the billion dollar investments AMC plans on doing in years to come, ""Have you ever wanted to recline at the movies, snuggle at the movies, or maybe even take a shit? Here at AMC you'll soon to be able to do all three simultaneously!""  Yeah and Shere means Tiger and Bagheera means Black Panther. And 'Bandar Log' means 'Monkey People'  Distributed by Disney, but only in North America. Yep, Spielberg's last 3 movies (War Horse, Lincoln, BoS) were distributed by Disney through their Touchstone Pictures imprint. His next movie (The BFG, which looks fantastic) will as well, though with the regular Disney label. > Although I do believe it was their first flop of 2016.

It was also their first movie of 2016.

They dumped it in January and didn't promote it at all. Looking at their slate, I fear that Through the  Looking Glass might be their worst release of 2016 in quality, though to be fair it could still be damn good and be their worst, they're such on a roll. They're truly the dream factory.  Like that time when the Axe gang starts dancing in the opening sequence in Kung Fu Hustle? The 1960's King Louie was cheerful enough to sing that song . While the 2016's King Louie is portrayed as a reclusive and a primate obsessed with the Red Flower .  It's not even a problem with realism... just seemed like a minor inconsistency in character. Maybe if they made him more like the King Louie of the cartoon, who was introduced to be obsessed with jazzy tunes to begin with. 

Zippa da boobidy bop bow. Tim-a-dimma rimma dang dang. I was a little weird, but I liked it. The movie didn't take itself too seriously, which I think helped the overall quality. My point was that movies that don't have a ton of CGI usually get the award, not that those were bad choices (Ex Machina was a good choice). Star Wars.  Star Wars? [deleted]

Meanwhile, the film's also being written by Ron Clements, John Musker, and Taika Waititi (Director, Writer, ""Viago"" of *What We Do in the Shadows*) I read this in Elba's voice. It was pretty efficient! Yeah and Bagheera says, ""Don't fight him like a wolf. Fight him like a man.""

Edit: I took it as a blessing from him. ""I'm okay with your using your 'tricks.' You'll think of something."" Did you just suggest that a twenty foot fall would kill a cat? Yeah she could do ASMR I'm thinking it was edited for time. Wouldn't be surprised to see it in a director's cut. I think Favreau just likes working with her. He's done it like, four times now I think.  Anna Kendrick as Belle,

Gerard Butler as Beast,

Dwayne Johnson as Gaston,

Ewan (or NPH) as Lumiere,

Jason Alexander as Cogsworth I was thinking that. Maybe they could still use his recordings. To honor him.  I liked how Shere Khan climbed when he was inside the dead tree at the end. That's how I imagine a big cat would climb--in jumps and starts, not one paw at a time. Thats called full guard, theyll grab your arm with their front paws and bite down while using the full kicking power of their hind legs to scratch you.  Cat Jitsu. can confirm; have small cat. you sick son of a bitch! I did a similar thing. I leaned over and said ""oh, look, we're about to watch The Lion King""! haha awesome. Thanks! There are wolves in the  jungle ? I thought they were living only in cold areas. Probably not the  same species I guess.  That's not true at all. They showed a meerkat at the end, desert hopping mice several times and rainbow bee-eaters too (both Australian). If anything they seemed to be trying to make it not defined as India.    

(Really late to this discussion, oops) Actually, it only took a few weeks. [They trucked in full-grown male elephants and resolved the issue](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-delinquents/). Not even close to human smart, but yeah that is interesting. They're [sentient](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-science-is-in-elephants-are-even-smarter-than-we-realized-video/). Damn I hadn't seen that BFG trailer yet, that book was my childhood, now I'm excited. The BFG was actually co-produced and co-financed by Disney, they're not just distributing it. I got the trailer for that movie before every single movie I saw during Oscar season, alongside Concussion. Basically torture. I don't think it'll be bad, they have the director who revived the Muppets after all (since Burton's doing Miss Peregrine's instead). It's an award for ""best VFX"" not ""best CGI"" The Golden Compass and Benjamin Button were both massively reliant on CGI. A bit late to the thread, but what about Life of Pi? Ridiculous amounts of VFX in that and it won.  Take your upvote and go. 

I laughed too hard.  WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT THE FIRST TIME?? shere khan got home alone'd Nope, never said ""twenty feet"".
It could have been a lot higher than twenty feet, I personally didn't take the time to measure. Howevaaaah, they were high enough that Mowgli could swing above the flames without roasting...then again shouldn't the smoke have choked him from so high above...Man Alive, I just don't know anything now! Oh god, her voice in Her was amazing Isn't that basically what she did in Her? I was being sarcastic regarding the comment above mine saying ""Beauty and the Beast would be nice,"" unknowing that the movie is already being made with the actors I suggested. 

That being said, Dwayne Johnson as Gaston would be amazing. I feel like that's a huge missed opportunity.  The Jungle Pamphlet. Indian Wolf - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_wolf Wolves live EVERYWHERE.    I think the hopping mice were meant to be Jerboa. Meerkat might have been a mongoose as well, I saw them when I lived in Fiji and they came from India, they could stand up on their back legs and everything [deleted] Still, awards voters can often confuse ""Best Visual Effects"" for ""Most Visual Effects"". A film that is an overwhelming storm of great-looking character models and explosions can win over a well done, subtle effect. Ex Machina's win was the exception, not the rule. CAUSE I LIKE MAKING UP ABBREVIATIONS AND CONFUSING PEOPLE ""In early November 2008, a wolf attacked an 87-year-old woman in the village cemetery of Kashan in central Iran, biting off one of her fingers, but was suffocated to death when she fought back.""

I bet none of her Grandkids talked back to her.  Have you ever lifted your toilet tank lid? Fucking wolves, every time.. You should've abbreviated that. ",0
40,"Michael Keaton has probably less than 5 minutes of screentime and he still registered his presence almost as much as the rest of the cast. What a charismatic actor!

Sacha Baron delivered the best scene though. ""It's the academy awards of protesters and it's an honor just to be nominated"" was hands-down the most Sorkin line in this piece. 

Also, that opening was brilliant and riveting. I knew before the title card hit that I was in for a great film. Best film I've seen in a long time. Mark Rylance was absolutely phenomenal in this film.

After so many of his recent roles being quiet and reserved men, the moment he yells “NO HE DOESN’T” was a legitimately powerful and thundering moment. Good lord. The judge is fucking infuriating.

I’m still processing this movie. It’s... maddening. That was the most ""and that student's name? Albert Einstein""-ass ending I've ever seen. Can we give Frank Langella some props for being probably the best on screen villain since whoever the guy that played Skeletor in Masters Of The Universe is. The opening was fantastic. Sorkin does such a good job settling you in to a time and place. I immediately knew who everyone was and why they were important. The made-up ending felt very cheesy, especially when you have it coming right after Sacha Baron-Cohen delivered one the best scene in the film. That aside the film was fantastic. Judge was an asshole as he supposed to be so props to Langella. Refreshing to see Gordon-Levitt again, even though he has little room to wiggle through. 

That aside, delving down the wiki-hole after watching it was one hell of a ride. The Fred Hampton assassination was fucking disgusting, although it looked tame compared to the COINTELPRO shit the FBI did. [deleted] I suppose the ""one egg is an oeuf"" joke needs to be added to the grand list of Sorkinisms Abbie Hoffman was also portrayed in Forrest Gump.  The hippie at the Vietnam protest who gives him the microphone and says ""Viet Fucking Nam!"" Really enjoyed the movie. Did a great job of showing, as Hoffman said, the contempt the government had (and still has) for certain groups of people. Mayor’s office denying permits to the park, police armed to the teeth at a peaceful protest because of the lack of permits, the police hounding, cornering, and then starting the violence. Nixon’s White House and the DOJ making an example out of a group of people that the prior DOJ found to be innocent. A racist bigot senile judge who has already determined guilt before the trial began. It’s all so infuriating. Mark Rylance was amazing in this. Should be nominated for Supporting Actor. Sacha Baron Cohen, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Redmayne and Yahya Abdul-Mateen were also great. I know some people aren't happy with the name reading at the end, but I honestly found it touching and teared up some. The protest where about stopping more deaths in a unwinnable war.  I like to think it was also done to really echo whats going on today: too many innocent lives were lost that didn't need to be lost- from covid, to police brutality, and protest. It's too easy to just recognize the amount of deaths and not see them as individuals wiith families.

The acting was honestly amazing. I honestly forgot this was a Sorkin feature. The court transcript is available online and this trial really was a travesty of justice. 

I think this movie did a serviceable job in toe-ing the line to portray an infuriating situation without coming off as ham-fisted (i.e. making the prosecution cartoonish-ly evil and the defence cartoonishly good). In my opinion, the events speak for themselves without needing to take artistic license with the characters of anyone involved. 

However, these moments in particular felt contrived.

1) The final scene of Hayden reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers did not happen as far as I'm aware, and the change from what really happened seemed unnecessary. The actual closing statement made by Kunstler is really powerful, and I'll quote it at the end. 

2) The moment where Hoffman talks about pronouns and how he has actually read all of Hayden's publications was sort of a ""wink at the camera"" moment. 

3) Ramsey Clark's portrayal was a caricature. Making him a casual give-no-fucks badass was satisfying to watch as a viewer, but definitely was playing to the audience's sympathies. 

4) One of the most confusing additions is David Dellinger punching the deputy, which did not happen in real life. Dellinger was a radical pacifist and this addition is offensive. 

5) Showing Fred Hampton being murdered during the time of the trial - when he was murdered over a month later. 


-----------------------------------------


General thoughts:

I enjoyed the decision to humanize JGL by showing his internal struggle between his ethics and duty to the law- though I'm not sure as to the veracity of this.

Incredible performances by Judge Hoffman, Seale, Kunstler, Dellinger, Hayden, and Strong in particular. Eddie Redmayne pulled off a great accent, while surprisingly I felt that Sacha Baron Cohen's accent was a little sloppy at times. 

Sorkin is a master of dialogue, and could have done without some of the snarky whispers that are really directed at the audience. 	Most of Lee Weiner's dialogue consisted of these quips.

-----------------------------

All-in-all, the events that happened are really so absurd that it must have been hard to convey their realism. Things like Hoffman/Rubin wearing the robes, the treatment of Seale, gross bias from the judge, etc. 

The verdict of the trial in reality was not a feel-good moment, and I'm still confused as to why it was portrayed as such. Along with the sentences, the judge ordered the long hair of the defendants AND defense attorneys to be forcibly cut due to being deemed offensive. The real life events left many people angry, and I believe this movie should have left the viewer feeling angry as well - if true to history. 

-----------------------------

Parts of the closing statement from the (real life) trial:

>  ""When a new truth comes upon the earth, or a great idea necessary for mankind is born, where does it come from?  Not from the police force, or the prosecuting attorneys, or the judges, or the lawyers, or the doctors.  Not there.  It comes from the despised and the outcasts, and it comes perhaps from jails and prisons.  It comes from men who have dared to be rebels and think their thoughts, and their faith has been the faith of rebels.
    ""What do you suppose would have happened to the working men except for these rebels all the way down through history?  Think of the complacent cowardly people who never raise their voices against the powers that be.  If there had been only these, you gentlemen of the jury would be hewers of wood and drawers of water.  You gentlemen would have been slaves.  You gentlemen owe whatever you have and whatever you hope to these brave rebels who dared to think, and dared to speak, and dared to act.""


> An intolerable war abroad has divided and dismayed us all.  Racism at home and poverty at home are both causes of despair and discouragement.  In a so-called affluent society, we have people starving, and people who can't even begin to approximate the decent life.
    These are rough problems, terrible problems, and as has been said bv everybody in this country, they are so enormous that they stagger the imagination.  But they don't go away by destroying their critics.  They don't vanish by sending men to jail.  They never did and they never will.
    To use these problems by attempting to destroy those who protest against them is probably the most indecent thing that we can do.  You can crucify a Jesus, you can poison a Socrates, you can hand John Brown or Nathan Hale, you can kill a Che Guevara, you can jail a Eugene Debs or a Bobby Seale.  You can assassinate John Kennedy or a Martin Luther King, but the problems remain.  The solutions are essentially made by continuing and perpetuating with every breath you have the right of men to think, the right of men to speak boldly and unafraid, the right to be masters of their souls, the right to live free and to die free.  The hangman's rope never solved a single problem except that of one man. I've never had the beginning of a movie hype me up more than this one. The introduction of Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger, and Jerry Rubin finishing each other's sentences, mixed with the archival footage of the mounting tensions over Vietnam and the draft was spectacular. Like we were immediately rolling into the sixties. Honestly, I feel like this movie is perfect in its timing. The widespread protests, police violence, judicial appointments, political trials, the chaos behind the concept of “law and order”, etc. 

Being someone who lives in Portland and has attended numerous protests here (only to have the narrative be reconstructed in a misleading way 99% of the time) it felt somewhat justified to have a similar story told on screen.

I also loved the way they portrayed the differences between Bobby Seale and the rest of the group: Bobby was **not** treated like a human being with equal protections under the law during this trial. The scene where they gagged him actually made me feel sick. Obviously he’s not a huge part of the conclusion of the story, but I’m very happy that they gave us plenty of time to absorb what he went through and how he was treated in the initial phases rather than having them treat him like some sort of tangent. 

Then the differences between Hayden and Hoffman was great. I loved their dialogue and I feel like it tells a story about what’s currently happening with the left side of the US political spectrum. I’m someone who relates to Hayden a bit more than I relate to Hoffman, but when Hayden stands for the judge, I actually wanted to scream at him. I also loved when Hoffman gave his testimony and blew everyone out of the water. 

And that judge....I think the last “character” I hated more was Joffrey Baratheon (and Joff was fictional!). 

Overall, I can see why this movie might not be super satisfying for normal people who aren’t revolving their entire lives around the current political situation were in, but for myself, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Clap at the end felt like such a 90s scene. 

Still enjoyed the movie although I didn't know that much about that story. Best line: 

""Alright, raise your hands if any of you have ever shown up for jury duty. No? Then shut the fuck up."" Such a good film.

Frank Langella, SBC, Mark Rylance and Eddie Redmayne deserve to be up for awards consideration.

Really liked how Sorkin spliced real riot footage in between filmed riot footage. Made you fee like you were actually there.

The shots at Trump were kinda noticeable as well ""The President is not the client of the Attorney General.""

Definitely something to watch in history class to educate our kids. I loved the 'do you think there were only 7 people protesting and the rest were all FBI informants?' line. I've often wondered that myself pertaining to certain groups. Incredible, IMO. 

The acting ranged from passable to great. No bad performances. Frank langella was excellently frustrating as the judge. Cohen and Redmayne were really evocative of their respective counterparts, even if they weren't spot on impressions.

The writing was excellent, Sorkin-y but not outlandish. Witty but not to the point of not being believable. Often Sorkin's characters dont seem real becuase of how quick witted they all are. I felt he pulled back enough here though.
I believe I remember that egg joke from an episode of the westwing from Margaret to Leo, too.

Directing was pretty good too. The story moved along well. And the framing of the story around the trial was very well done.

For cons.. I do find it dipped in intensity a little bit once Bobby Seales mistrial was called, that really felt like a bigger ""win"" than the ending. And the ending wasnt great, but to be fair the ending in real life wasnt great either. I honestly cant think of a way for the real life ending to be portrayed optimistically, maybe it shouldnt have been. But I respect Sorkin for trying, there are enough pessimists.

Solid 9 / 10 I never wanted to beat a judge with a bat more in my life. Holy fuck if that person was real I would pay good money to see him get hit by a car. I was impressed by the performances (Jeremy Strong was particularly entertaining) and liked the ultimately anti-war messages even if the final scene was a little outlandish. Anyone else notice a few weird cuts, particularly towards the beginning of the trial when the judge shuts down Abbie? Loved this. Gripping story, legitimately funny, and genuinely moving. This movie felt like Sorkin really finding a way to blend so much of what makes his work so special-- snappy dialogue, quippy humor, courtroom drama, and serious, heavy-handed political themes. 

I went in with high expectations and Sorkin really exceeded them. As an aside-- at the end of the movie, when they gave us the coda about how the defendants lives progressed, I realized just how old-fashioned  this type of movie has become. Shout out to Netflix and Paramount for having the hudspa to put out a movie like this. I’m amazed by it! Is it mostly factual? There was really a bound and gagged defendant? I can't remember the last movie I saw with such an excellent ensemble cast. Nearly every performance in this movie is worthy of an Oscar nomination. Combined with Sorkin's writing and directing, it is my favorite movie of the year so far, and will likely remain so. Michael Keaton. What a fucking man. A bit late. But I ADORED THAT MOVIE, so so good. 

Eddie Redmayne is such a great actor. Can’t wait for Fantastic Beasts 3! Mark Rylance fucking killed it. Going into this film, with all the talent involved, he was kind of the last person I was looking at out of that cast. His performance told me “fuck you” and ended up and ended up overshadowing everyone else. You know you’re a great actor when you end up more noticeable than Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman with a giant afro. Bravo, Mark Rylance. You always surprise me. It has definitely been a hot minute since a film had me 100% hooked, this was a masterpiece. The most Sorkin thing I’ve ever seen and probably will ever see is how he made vague, haphazard grammar the literal direct cause of the riot, the major dramatic reveal of the movie, and due to causing the riot, the reason for the movie to exist in the first place.

Sorkin has gone mad with power. Honestly the more I’ve read into the trial the more it’s obvious Sorkin decided to forfeit real history with the sanitized, liberalized version of it. 

Hayden wasn’t a buttoned up, quiet bookish type. He regularly made harsh calls to arms and was described as a militant anti-war advocate. He embraced the antics of the defendants and even sported a bucket hat and fake goatee, and went to sleep on the table during the trial. 

Dellinger was by far the oldest but not a shrinking violet. HE read the names (of American AND  Viet-Cong soldiers) portrayed at the end of the movie, during which Hoffman and Hayden laid out an American AND Viet-Cong flag. The bailiffs then fought Hoffman for the Vietnamese flag but left the American one, pushing Hoffman to announce the court is okay with the defendants disrespecting America but not Vietnam. Dellinger also called Schultz and the judge racists and Nazis and was cited for contempt for that. 

Bobby Seale was tied up for 3 consecutive days before he was released and allowed a new trial. The bailiffs also punched him in the testicles during the trial at one point when his bonds slipped. 

Jerry Rubin was certainly a stoner and played the dumb hippie well. But also could be very articulate and was actually fairly intelligent, becoming a hugely successful businessman in the 80s. He also didn’t fall for the “honey pot.” The informant tied to him was an undercover male cop that largely tailed him and definitely didn’t use the same line on him as Margaret did in “The West Wing.”

The trial as a whole was a clown show at best. All the defendants AND the lawyers worked together to make a mockery of the judge because they knew it was a biased. 

I get artistic license and I understand making a good movie but this was pretty egregious. 

EDIT: spelling and grammar because mobile Here is a collection of \[historical reanacement\] audio recordings, I have clipped it to an [exchange between Hoffman and Bobby Seale](https://youtu.be/_ENAMIqEU_w?t=1025), outlining the numerous contempt charges which added up to 3 years in prison. Note Hoffman is longwinded. There is some context before [relating to Seale not having access to an attorney](https://youtu.be/_ENAMIqEU_w?t=412).

Just give Sorkin all the movies.  Any movie.

Guy is a goddamn genius with dialogue. I just watched this movie and I just wanna say that that judge is a complete bastard. This was a pretty amazing movie, one of the top movies of the year so far. The dialogue was excellent and very well-written, the actors performances were all Oscar worthy, and the story was great. It’s definitely one of the better movies I’ve seen in a while, and for you people complaining about Hollywood unoriginality, this is a nice break away from reboots/sequels/remakes/franchise movies. And plus for people like me who love courtroom dramas, it’s a surefire winner. Sacha Baron Cohen’s character portrayal was great. His accent, not so much. Turns out a career doing comedic accents doesn’t quite fully prepare you for the real thing. Rylance and Redmayne had it down pat, though. 

Everyone’s talking about the ending, because it’s the most blatant and obvious inaccuracy. It really took me out of the experience and I’m surprised nobody told him how lame that looked. If it was 1992 I’d get it but in 2020 it’s been done to death and feels so fake. 

The music during the riot scene was amazing. I’m surprised it wasn’t done by someone I’ve heard of. I really loved the movie.

Jeremy Strong Sach Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance were the standouts (either Rylance or SBC or both should get a nom). Redmayne was very good. Nobody disappointed.  Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale was a scene stealer, particularly in one scene (you know the one).

I particularly liked the contrast between Cohen and Redmayne's characters, and how they represented change in different ways.

The editing and the cinematography was also really great. It can make a scene carry weight.

The movie also seemed very relevant to today's society, and I'm sure that's no coincidence.

My only problem with it was the ending with everyone standing up and the inspirational music while the Judge suddenly is helpless to stop it. Felt very ""Robert Zumeckis"". But that's a neatpick. 

Edit: Also, Michael Keaton entire scene and testimony were so satisfying. And Ramsey Clark is STILL ALIVE! This is one of those great movies that came out at the perfect time Jeremy Strong and SBC really shone in this film imo. The whole cast was great but their performances went above and beyond imo I really enjoyed this film. One theme it touches is how power and control can be above justice and truth, very relevant for today's discourse. A great work of art. Jeremy Strong absolutely killed his role - between this and succession he’s quickly becoming one of my favorites. All around I loved the movie but I haven’t checked all the historical accuracies yet A lot of great performances in here. Very impressed with Sacha Baron Coen especially in the scene where he takes the stand. Mark Rylance was killing it the whole movie too. Eddie Redmayne gave a very quiet nuanced performance and spoke a lot with his body language. Yahya Abdul Mateen is really a scene stealer his scene in the jail is incredibly poignant. Jeremy Strong was pretty hilarious throughout. I loved Michael Keaton’s brief appearance as well. 

Great use of editing in this movie during the trial scenes loved the way it cut between flashbacks and people on the stand, different characters finishing sentences. 

The portrayal of the rivalry between Hoffman and Hayden was a great narrative thread that was pretty relevant to today. They both had good points and it was nice to see them sort of embracing each other in the final moments. Hoffman becomes more composed on the stand and Hayden creates a flashy display on the trials final day. 

The police scenes were hard to watch at times and man that judge is a piece of human garbage. This mirrors what's happening right now to a crazy degree. When was this filmed?! [deleted] Fun but random fact. The real life William Kunstler had a cameo in Spike Lee's Malcolm X. I have a feeling he took inspiration from a certain judge when he took on the role lol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JopWuajwVRQ Anyone got real-life video or pictures of the egg catch. That feels like one of those specific details that you don't make up. One of the wildest things about this great movie is that I actually saw Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a somewhat unlikable person. 

Academy Awards all around. Superb. Not Sorkin's best, but the snappy, infectious energy of his dialogue bled into the directing choices as well, and not a moment felt wasted. Unexpectedly hilarious, too.

Also, I'm so happy to see my man Jeremy Strong finally getting the spotlight he deserves. Seeing both Ken and Tabitha in this movie made me very happy as a Succession superfan. Damn Mark Rylance could read a phone book in from his cell phone in a phone booth and Id watch it on my phone for 2 hours Was anyone else mystified by Abbie Hoffman’s accent? Was that how he really sounded? I looked him up and the real person was from Worcester ma, so maybe it was supposed to be a Boston accent, but if so it was a really bad one. Sacha Baron Cohen is usually incredible at accents, impressions, etc so this surprised me. Otherwise he was great. I went into this a little apprehensive since I'm not the biggest fan of court room dramas and sadly/admittedly didn't know much about the subject matter. 

But I was thoroughly pleased by my viewing experience. I thought the writing (dialogue) was fantastic; the editing was really good as well, as it flew by for me and never seemed to drag. And the performances were all really great. I've read some comments about miscasting without giving further context on the matter, but I'm not sure I understand that perspective.

I did, however, find the inclusion of Bobby Seale a bit odd. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was amazing in the role, but I'm not sure what importance his character played in the narrative as a whole to propel the story forward. Then again, I'm not familiar with the history, so maybe his inclusion was necessary. 

Overall, a solid flick. One of my Top 10 for the year. I can see this getting a few nomes for Writing, Editing, and Performances. I think this movie was so well-written and had such great wit. ONE of my fav lines was when Abbie was on the stand and he said: Lincoln’s  speech states that when the people should grow weary of their constitutional right to amend their government they should exert their revolutionary right to dismember and overthrow that government. 

Lawyer: So how do you overthrow or dismember the government peacefully?

Abbie:In this country we do it every four years.

To me that was hilarious because it shows that them protesting caused more of a revolution than the voting system. 

I loved seeing that there are people in society that critically think and don’t just believe what authorities have to say. Rather than thinking the law is absolutely right, some people are willing to question it and revolt when necessary. These are my kind of people. Revolution with a purpose. If I was to rank the supporting actor performances for this year from what I’ve seen now, I honestly think these guys would take up 5 of the top 6 spots. The other being Malachi Kirby in Mangrove. These performances are all so amazing but here’s how I’d probably rank them.

1. Mark Rylance

2. Frank Langella who is absolutely despicable here

3. Eddie Redmayne

4. Sacha Baron Cohen

5. Jeremy Strong

6. Yahya Abdul-Matten

7. Joseph Gordon-Levitt

Also holy shit, I somehow had no idea it was Kelvin Harrison Jr. playing Fred Hampton. to me this was the most approachable sorkin script. super well written of course, but didn't sound like stereotypical sorkin-esque high-level dialogue. still witty and cunning but in a much more thoughtful way. 
  
also, can someone ELI5 why kunstler couldn't represent bobby? they kept explaining it and every time i just couldn't understand it

Edit: replies have answered now thanks :) “The president isn’t the client of the attorney general” Someone should tell that to the Donald. Watched this with my SO last night and we loved it. I've never seen a 2+ hour movie go so quickly. I could have watched that for 7 hours to be honest. Sorkin's dialogue always keeps me hooked, and the editing was incredible too. 

I'm also quite disconnected from the subject matter, given that I'm in my mid 20s and British, so I loved learning about the events taking place. [Here's a fact or fiction article for those interested ](https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/trial-chicago-seven-aaron-sorkin-accuracy-netflix.html) I thought the acting was fine to good, but man did he absolutely change way too much of the story for me. Like the actual people and a lot of what was said in court was really inspiring, but I guess Sorkin gonna Sorkin. 

And the last scene was literally the ""and then everybody clapped."" Meme in a movie. Felt like it belonged in a satire not a serious movie. I will illegally read “Steal this book” today .. not gonna pay for it just because.. you know I was not convinced Eddie Redmayne was a really great actor before this film (despite the Oscar), I NOW see he really is a skilled actor. He was fantastic in this. Loved the movie. While not exactly duplicating the events encompassing the Chicago 7 Trial, the movie caries the spirit and truth of this intense, mind shattering era. I loved the beginning, with the  monstrous death scythe of the draft , the murders of King and Kennedy, the corruption of government setting up the absolute necessity of a response in Chicago 1968. 
I was lucky enough to be living in Chicago in 1969, and so was able to do a bit of volunteer work at the Conspiracy office. I was 17 and right out of high school. This experience has had an enormous influence going forward in my life. Much respect for all, and rest in power Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. I love this film. That judge is really infuriating it's almost an exact representation of our current administration. I think the sharpest commentary in this film was by-far the conflict of ideology between Hoffman and Holden as placeholders for radical Idealism and Pragmatism.

Knowing Sorkin's politics going into the film, I knew the essential points that were going be made. I was NOT however, expecting an internal dialogue about frictions and in-fighting on the left (VERY relevant nowadays). What’s more important; playing the part until you can ascend the hierarchy enough to dismantle the system, or seeing the bigger picture and shaping hearts and minds to change the psychological landscape? The film did a great job of highlighting these different ideologies accurately, as well as making it clear that whilst one attitude is more sensible and agreeable, the other is a lot sexier and more immediately appealing. Ultimately though, these two voices have to come to an understanding and unite in the face of their common enemy (taking the form of the ‘thug’ judge). It takes a healthy mix of both idealistic and pragmatic thinking to make change.

This struck me as the most interesting and poignant theme in this film, and perhaps Sorkin’s main angle since he knew people on the right probably weren’t going to give the film a chance:
That everyone on the left needs to put aside their moral-elitism or smug-centrism and come together as a united front. Because people on the right have a fuck of a lot less in-fighting.

Yours Sincerely,

A smug centrist. I'm confused by the comments. I just watched the film and I loved it because of the storytelling style and the way it played with music and editing and the acting, but I don't know much about the director and I don't know much about cinema either, although I love it with passion. So, is this a good movie or not? Is it a good adaptation of history or not? 

I would love some insight on this, I'm really interested in your opinion! It’s the fact that they let that judge keep his job for so long that irritates me. You know there’s a ton of other judges just like that one still to this day. “I’m the boss, I AM the court and you WILL RESPECT MAH ATHORITAY” I loved it. Frank Langella was so good that I wanted to punch his character through the TV There were parts that were done phenomenally and fewer moments that stood out to me as kinda poorly done in comparison especially the ending which left a really sour taste in my mouth. For a movie so angry and sparky the ending felt completely out of touch with the rest of the film.

The movie has an excellent sense of pacing however, and from the first scene you are immediately drawn into the plot. I was not expecting Mark Rylance to show up and put on the best performance of the movie. His frustration was palpable. 

Some of the decisions to change facts im history however were pretty gross and unforgivable. I recognize sometimes movies should alter facts to tell an entertaining movie, but those changes should be made only if it serves to benefit the movie, which the historical deviations featured in the film didn't always do.

Still, well worth a watch and the film had moments that were some of my favorite in a movie for 2020.

7.5/10

Would have had a 9 if the film was more reflective of history and ended on a less jubilant, more bittersweet and somber note. Having thought on this a bit, I thought overall it was an excellent film. As I wrote elsewhere in the thread there was obviously a lot of back and forth that could not have made it in due to time. The two issues I had are quite simple:

&#x200B;

Dellinger should **not** have punched anyone. It would be like having a film of version MLK Jr or Gandhi punch someone - it simply was inaccurate and needless.

Secondly, I wish there was more of the defence witnesses shown. Defence witnesses were *incredible*: Alan Ginsburg, Judy Collins, Timothy Leary, Arlo Guthrie, etc. It was the who's who of the liberal left movement on the stand. Hell, Judy Collins *sang* [Where Have All the Flowers Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxsNKD6el5s) *into the record.* Anyone else get a Dead Poets vibe at the end? As much as I really really enjoyed this movie, I can’t help but feel that if I were to read up on the actual historical events that the movie probably dramatized a decent chunk of this. 

I know The Imitation Game isn’t really well-liked on Reddit, but I felt the same way about this as I did with that; super entertaining but it felt as though so much of it was historically inaccurate.

EDIT: to elaborate more, I know that Sorkin took liberties with The Social Network and Steve Jobs and that movies don’t NEED to be historically accurate but it’s just that it felt like the edges were sanded off and that the finished product felt a bit sanitized. I don’t get the problem with the movie being a bit inaccurate or dramatized because with 6 months being chunked into a film, it is bound to happen. I don’t rate the movie on accuracy but as a film. That said, this isn’t a perfect film however it is stylized in a way that accentuates Sorkin’s dialogue. And I think that is a great aspect of the film considering it does revolve arguments, wording, and wit. Pretty good film overall, and the problem I see people have with it are the inaccuracies and the ending. Subjective as everything is but nothing is ever accurate to a T and being any more accurate wouldn’t translate too well on film. I don't see enough people talking about the score! The two primary sequences of police brutality (Jerry and Rennie on the Hill and Tom's Tape) are both underscored with some absolutely electrifying pieces of music. 


Pemberton has made some very diverse scores over the years, but the way the score begins in universe with the drums from the protest, only to have them continue and build when the scene ends in stellar. You can literally hear the moment that the protest has gotten away from our main characters' control as the score becomes too fast for the chanting, too chaotic and frenetic in the moments before 'Take the hill!'.


Truly an outstanding couple of songs there. 


Which makes the horrible over the top music at the end that much more baffling. I just finished the movie and damn it may be one of the best movies I’ve ever seen it even made me put my phone away and watch the movie 10/10 would try again What a great film. One of the best ensemble casts I can remember, and no one does a court room drama better than Sorkin. Holy shit, what a cast, what a performance. Loved every second of it. I’m conflicted about this movie.

On the one hand, I really dislike how Sorkin portrays leftist politics. The tension between pragmatism and idealism is a gross oversimplification of the arguments on the left. When Abbie says that we have a revolution “every four years” I think I visibly winced. That felt, to me, at least, like Sorkin making leftists out to be liberals. The fact that many of these people were socialists seems to be unspoken on purpose, but at least the Black Panthers are depicted somewhat fairly. I think Sorkin’s liberal centrism shines through here even more than it does in The West Wing, where he’s replaced the actual closing statement with a feel-good ending. The ending was not feel-good in real life, and I think putting a liberal “good guys always win by taking the moral high ground” spin on what is really a tough leftist struggle, a disservice is done to all people involved. Same with having Dellinger, a radical pacifist, punch the cops in the courtroom.

On the other hand, hoooooly shit is this some good-ass Sorkin. I’m a fanboy and idgaf. Superb writing, direction, performances. Spectacular movie.

In short, I’m a radical leftist who gives Sorkin a pass because holy fucking shit is he good lmao Can anyone explain the political opinion differences between Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden? I saw the movie twice now, and was wondering. That scene where Hayden stood for the judge after Bobby Seale was gagged, did that actually ever happen or was that just added for dramatic effect/make Hayden look as if he was more worried about appearances? Great movie but I almost regret watching it, just to soul crushing. Makes me so angry and sad that there is so little justice in the world. Honestly crying, I just fucking hate everything about this being real. This kind of became one of my favourite movies. I never even heard it was coming out until I saw it on Netflix. Incredible surprise Can someone please explain to me why the fraternity guys were so pissed about the girl with the flag? Loved this movie. I thought most of the performances were amazing. Sometimes courtroom dramas like this can drag, but I think the whole thing was paced very well; I was gripped the whole time.

Wanted to give a shoutout to the Jack and the Beanstalk joke/conversation, actually made me laugh out loud in the middle of a somewhat tense scene haha. The script kind of felt all over the place at times, but overall was a pretty good film depicting how the government acted against protestors. Funny coincidence that it came out this year. I figured the scene where Bobby Seale is bound in court was dramatized for effect, but sounds like the reality was even worse than what Sorkin put in the film. So after reading the real history of the case, I think Sorkin did a very good job of showing how nuts this trial was while making sure it, for the most part, did not seem as literally unbelievable as the reality was.

Edit: It sounds like he didn't do as great a job with the characters themselves, which seems kind of strange. I feel like if he needed more drama there was more than enough real-life shit to draw on. But ah well. Abdul-Mateen deserves a ton of praise for his acting in this film and I'm glad to see him getting a lot of substantial roles lately. Absolutely loved this. Everyone was superb. Hated Frank Langella, so he must have been excellent. Not a single duff note. This movie was fine. I enjoy Sorkin as a writer just like most everyone, but this didn’t really have the sharp precision like Social Network or Steve Jobs. He’s good at emotional swells but he leaned on that a little too much for me and it made for some sentimental moments that I didn’t really connect with. I’ve seen this and Molly’s game and I have to say I’m not really a fan of his touch as a director. I’m not a filmmaker so I won’t pretend to know specifics but there’s something about his music choice and the way he shoots things that seems kind of bland. Die hard Sorkin heads will worship this movie and rightfully so, but I think a different directors approach would’ve taken a story like this to the heights it could reach. The film was entertaining.

HOWEVER the film pretty inaccurate. Idk much about the actual trial to be honest but I do know a lot about the Black Panthers and Fred Hampton's murder does not match the time line at all. Sorkin just threw that in there. Also Bobby Seale was bound and gagged for THREE DAYS straight not 10 minutes like the film made it seem.

The ""cop murder"" the movie mentions Seale was arrested for was actually a Black Panther member/suspected FBI informant.

I also think they tried too hard to make the prosecution look sympathetic to the 7. 

It was a good film though. Maybe I've been a little more starved for good new movies than normal, but I fucking adored this movie. Those who don't like Sorkin, this will likely not convert you to his writing, but his directing is a step up from his first effort, and the editing alongside the other tech elements are especially sharp and easily watchable.

The main draw here is the acting and the dialogue (who doesn't love to watch witty people argue, honestly?). While a lot of people have shouted the praises of the cast, Mark Rylance was the standout for me, just being so damn watchable and easy to root for. He stands a good chance at an Oscar nod. However, he'll be duking it out with Yahya Abdul Mateen who embodies everything frustrating about this trial and how it treated Bobby Seale in so many damn good ways, and Sacha Baron Cohen who starts out a bit one note, but really makes Abbie Hoffman truly interesting, deep, and compelling. While he probably won't get awards love, Frank Langella is also so fucking good at portraying how incompetent and scary Judge Hoffman was.

I'd also like to give a shoutout to the rest of the cast who probs won't get nominations; not a single one is giving a bad performance. Michael Keaton is stealing the show in two very noteworthy scenes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is showing up to remind us how much we've missed him recently and brings a little bit more to what could be a one-note character. JOHN FUCKING CAROLL LYNCH, the Zodiac Killer himself, is there being amazing and I really wanted to say his name, alongside Jeremy Strong who had me laughing way too damn much. Finally, I've had issues with him previously, and was originally worried about him in the first third, but Eddie Redmayne playing someone so different from his usual wheelhouse was a sight to see, especially his performance in the last third.

Watch this movie, and if you're voting a certain way coming up, really look for the similarities. While some of this movie was made with those modern similarities in mind, the events of this summer could not have been predicted to be so close to what unfolds in parts of this movie. Watch it, and really think about who you're voting for. Is this still a good movie to watch if I have zero interest in US politics?

EDIT: so I've watched it and for anyone else wondering the same thing, yes it's a still a good movie even if you don't care about US politics Every single actor did their job amazingly in this film! this movie was very very good...as expected of a film written by the one and only Aaron Sorkin.... Just finished watching.  Wow. I hated the judge so much I even hate Frank Langella now.  
Really great movie. Scary how much history is repeating itself. It's crazy how many parallels the events of this movie have to today. Just unbelievable Reading some of the criticism I just wanted to say that I think it’s 100% acceptable to take artistic license with historical events to convey an overall sentiment. If you want total historic accuracy read a book or watch a documentary, that’s not the point of narrative filmmaking. It's incredible that Sorkin wrote the script for this nearly a decade ago. It feels so tailored to the present moment. Cool movie. Performances were good all around. IRL he didn't actually read those names in court tho, right? I mean they would have obviously beat his ass and dragged him away by the 9th name. Eddie Redmayne was great. The music in this movie added so much energy, I loved it. This film was fantastic. Not gonna lie, when Jeremy Strong first came on the screen I burst into laughter and feared I wouldn’t be able to take it seriously. But I ended up being thoroughly impressed with the overall performances. Mark Rylance, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Eddie Redmayne in particular were absolutely wonderful. what accent was Sascha trying to portray?

Mark Rylance can do no wrong.  Jeremy Strong was also unrecognizable. Enjoyed the movie but man that last scene is 90’s prestige cheeseball ending. It stops just short of one person starting a slow clap. Im sorry but how the fuk did a guy like Julius fucking Cuntman become a judge? And how the fuk was he not punished? Excellent, particularly Keaton, Rylance, Yahya, and John Carroll Lynch. I found the ending to be a little too cheesy. If they had gotten rid of the swelling music and the shot of the son being proud of his dad or whatever and just let the gravity of the names hit it would’ve been perfect. Besides that though great movie Mark my words, this movie will easily win Best Picture in next year's Oscars. It was riveting and perfectly timed politically. I loved Molly's Game and I think The Trial of the Chicago 7 is even better. Sorkin starting his movie directing career 2 for 2 [deleted] Everyone's already said what I wanted to say but I still wish to publicly declare my love for this movie because I enjoyed it so much: I love this movie! It might genuinely be my favourite of the year.

Sorkin's really refining his craft, especially as a director. He's always been a good writer but from a directing standpoint this is a huge step up from Molly's Game. Keaton scene was my favorite. Dick on table fuck you pay me style This is pretty conclusive evidence that Sorkin shouldn't be directing. The difference between David Fincher or Danny Boyle is stark. It was really clear that he could have used an expert hand, especially to help him resolve some of the more glaring problems (fade to black during the Hoffman testimony, abrupt and corny ending). Honestly I think he benefits from having to share decision-making power.

Overall this was pretty good, and a great performance from SBC. I don't mind editorial choices made to tell a good story (like Steve Jobs) but a lot of the choices made here force Sorkin's own weak politics into the story where they don't belong. 

It was heartbreaking the way Rubin was portrayed as a burnout and the Panthers were represented as libs (though Abdul-Mateen was great) who thought the idea of Seale saying ""fry the pigs"" was out of line. Also the fictional well-meaning undercover FBI agent who was only trying to help the protests continue peacefully, or how Richard Schultz was *reluctantly* going along with the prosecution but was secretly a ""good guy.""

Abbie Hoffman was portrayed mostly pretty well, but it was pretty frustrating to hear him on the stand say that he thought the US had great institutions and the only problem is the wrong people in charge. Like he was an anarcho-communist, he didn't just want a more polite democrat president he really wanted to change the country fundamentally. But since that perspective isn't something Sorkin's brain can really handle because he has bad politics Hoffman has to be made into a dissenting liberal. 

All these changes reinforce Sorkin's politics, which are basically that the status quo is fine, the FBI is good actually, there may be some bad eggs in the justice system from time too time but thank God that Our Great American Institutions will correct their errors, the Vietnam war was a crime *because of the draft* not because it killed millions in South East Asia.

Through these choices the actual voices of the defendants are ironed over, flattened into mild critique. That's a bummer, you know?

Edit: [Chapo released a podcast today with the guys from The West Wing Thing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackWolfFeed/comments/jgoy0i/465_sorkinverse_rise_of_the_7_feat_dave_anthony/) on the film that expresses a similar opinion to mine, but with a much more detailed understanding of the individuals and historical events. If you are interested in a thorough examination of how Sorkin misrepresented the characters they do a better and funnier job than I did. Turns out be misrepresent the truth in a much more significant way than I understood. I may need to see it a second time. Definitely was hard to follow at first, but was filled with great performances all around. It’s not Sorkin’s strongest work but also the one with the least amount of his cliches - I think there was only one walk and talk scene (the discussion before the tire slashing) Did anyone else notice what Bill said to Bobby when he was gagged?

*Can he breath? Can you breath all right, Bobby?* Holy shit dude, was the Judge really that bad in real life? Between Skeletor, Nixon and this fucking Judge, I think a part of me just irrationally hates Frank Langella What a movie! Honestly, the performances were pretty much great across the board. Plenty of humor sprinkled in, but not enough to take away from the serious subject matter. 

A friend has said that he measures a movie by how quickly it flies by. Thought this one FLEW, and I mean that in the best way possible. So much hate going towards SBC in this movie makes no sense. He fucking killed it. Dude is a stud This movie was something.....I loved every minute of it, I was glued to the screen, incredible script and performances. I thought the film was absolutely fantastic. The performances were all great, particular from Redmayne and Baron-Cohen. The editing was really good and the script was brilliant. It was also surprisingly funny which I was not expecting but enjoyed. Overall, a absolutely great film and perhaps my favourite by the end of the year Very topical and very effective. I found myself truly emotionally invested despite recognizing some clichés and some heavyhanded moments. For instance, at the end when >!Eddie Redmayne started reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers, and the music swelled, and the whole courtroom stood up and clapped!< I was rolling my eyes but also simultaneously had tears welling up in that very same pair of eyes. I will say, however, those moments were very few and far between and I did genuinely like this movie a lot. I love it when comedic actors go dramatic, so Sacha Baron Cohen was a standout for me, but I feel like Frank Langella is going really unappreciated as the Judge. He did a fantastic job of being such a believable, unlikable, unqualified asshole. He really disappeared into the part, he's a great actor. 

Another - not so much a critique, I guess more of a comment - I had was it wasn't as ""zing-y"" as Sorkin's previous scripts. For me, that was a bit of a letdown because I love zing-y Sorkin (Steve Jobs is a personal favorite). But I also know a lot of people criticize him for that same zing-y-ness, so this could be seen as a positive for this film.

Regardless, I really enjoyed it, and I think how emotionally affected I ended up is a testament to the film's quality. I think every American interested in the coming election (which should be all of us) should give this a watch Great movie. Each one of the actors in it did a phenomenal job. I gotta say, that was one of the best movie intro's I've ever seen! I'm a sucker for Sorkin.  Film definitely reached that itch.  It's disappointing to read some of the liberties he took, especially with the closing scene.


Performances made the movie for me.  Rylance, Cohen, Strong, and Langella were all fantastic.  JGL and Redmayne seemed to mail in their standard good-to-great performances, but nothing spectacular.  Michael Keaton holds such a presence nowadays, his revival is the best. I thought Alex Sharp had a quietly fantastic performance. I almost felt protective over him because of his sort of timid demeanor, which ended up paying off in the third act. That’s tough to do given his limited screen time. 

Have followed him since he won the Tony - he’s a great actor. I really enjoyed this film overall. It's nice to see another Sorkin film centered around a trial, as it reminded me of ""A Few Good Men"" at times. 

I also found the argument between Hayden and Abbie Hoffman to be a pretty powerful illustration of the differences within the progressive movement that still exist today. I think my biggest criticism would be that ended on a note that was a smidge too feel-good in my opinion, even by Sorkin standards-- but I think it was at least a nice antidote to how goddamn infuriating I found the judge to be. Seriously, Frank Langella's character is up there with Nurse Ratched and Dolores Umbridge in the pantheon of characters that just get under your skin. Wow. So many emotions... from sadness to complete fury. One of my takeaways is that judges have way too much power. I didn’t know much about The Chicago 7 going into this movie, but I do want to read up on it, if anyone has any book suggestions. I like the ending even if it's kinda cheesy Fantastic movie. I think Sorkin needs to be given more credit as a director. Simply hiring great actors doesn’t automatically mean amazing performances, but it’s clear with this and Molly’s Game he knows how to make great movies. Excited for anything he directs in the future now too, though I hope he continues getting movies made outside of his own directorial projects too. honestly, fuck that judge lol. i need to research what actually happened, but if even half of this movie is true, idk how that shit was allowed. Dude really did treat the court like he was in a latin american dictatorship country. 

far as the movie goes, if you like the Sorkin vibes, its great. Great acting all around, the dialogue is exactly what you expect- quippy, funny, not at all how real humans talk but its entertaining as shit. The editing work was actually really good and helped tell the story well (the part with Redmayne recounting a protest event was probably the highlight) *The Trial of the Chicago 7* manages to overcome the tv-movie hokiness most biopics-of-the-now fall into (a ""biopic-of-the-now"" is a movie about a historical event that's really about today's politics). I was worried in the first several minutes because of Sorkin's soundtrack choice, which is less fitting in a film about police brutality, the criminal justice system, and free speech than it is in *Hairspray*, but Sorkin, as he usually does when he's on his A-game, is charming enough to overcome that, using quick edits to emphasize just how cut-together these disparate organizers are.

Kyle Smith panned this movie by writing Sorkin's highest aim is to ""write quips."" I disagree with him, and it's largely because of the movie's final image. People here are pointing out the trial never ended with Hayden reading a list of the fallen, that it would have been more powerful for Sorkin to use Kunstler's closing statements. I disagree. Martin Luther King, Jr. was never as disagreeable with LBJ as *Selma* depicted him to be, yet that movie is praised by almost everyone on this subreddit, even for all its tv-movie hokiness (the action in Bloody Sunday sequence is horrifying, but it's undermined by the after-school special narration from the *Times* reporter covering the events).

I will gladly accept Sorkin's artistic license so long as he can compose a final image that is like a Trumbull painting in scope and meaning. It is perhaps his most realized statement of what America can be—even when it fails—than his entire run on *The West Wing.* If a picture's worth a thousand words, how many words am I saying this last image has? The black and white men and women standing as Hayden reads the names of the fallen, as Judge Hoffman bangs his gavel for order with as much fury as he can, is an America that takes a stand for justice when its institutions fail them while respecting and upholding its ideals all the same. A beautiful and stirring statement for a vivid and by turns horrifying movie. [deleted] If it wasn't for Covid this would probably have been a surprise box office hit of 2020, God knows Paramount would've needed it I really enjoyed this, its pretty easily my favorite movie of the year to this point. I'm a big Sorkin fan, and this cast is stacked with actors I like, so it was always a good bet that I would like this one, and I think its a step up from Molly's Game (which I also really liked). For the record, I was pretty unaware of this story (I'm American, but our schools do a pretty bad job of teaching recent American History) and didn't really know anything going in.

What I liked: I can't talk about a Sorkin movie without mentioning his writing. I especially loved the opening scene as it cut between the different groups. The performances are pretty much great across the board, with only one that I didn't like. Frank Langella would be my MVP, he was so hate-able and from what I understand the character was actually turned down. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Mark Rylance were also standouts. In particular I've never really seen SBC in a serious role, and now I really wish we'd gotten his Freddy Mercury movie. I really liked the way the movie was structured, with the flashbacks and real footage integrated into the movie.

What I didn't like: I didn't much buy Jeremy Strong's performance. I don't know much about Jerry Rubin, so maybe that's just how he actually comes across, but in this film it felt more like an actor in a costume than a real person. I wish a few of the actors had gotten more to do, especially John Carroll Lynch and JGL. And while I admit it got me pretty emotional at the time, I think the ending being a work of fiction takes something away from its power.

Overall this is a 9/10 for me. I think Sorkin hit a home run and I hope the attention on this keeps up through awards season. Seeing sealed bound and gagged. Shows how america never  had cared about us and I don't think it ever will. Fuck Aaron Sorkin's propagandist ass for going anywhere near this radical historical moment. This is like if people allowed Newt Gingrich to make a movie about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Fuck Netflix and fuck Hollywood for allowing this modern day Leni Riefenstahl to ever get his hands on this. Damn, that was a fucking great film. One of my favorites of the year. Might be the best screenplay of Sorkin's career. If Mark Ryalnce hadn't won an oscar for Bridges of Spies, I would say he's the clear favourite to win one for this movie. Just got done watching it

I thought it was a phenomenal movie and kept me interested the whole way

Except for the ending. Incredibly cheesy and hollywood

Other than that, amazingly done, and some fantastic performances What's up with Sacha's accent lol Every time Frank Langella is involved, I want to hit him in the face. I guess that speaks for his performance. If you look past the amazing cast, it's just a run of the mill courtroom drama/biopic that uses title cards for its conclusion. I thought it would have a stronger anti-war message, and it almost got there, but not quite. I thought this was an outstanding movie, and really dug SBC throughout. Even if some events were altered, it was really powerful. My Trump loving dad was on the side of the government and the judge. T_T I'd love to see Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong starring in a stoner buddy movie after this I was glued to this movie the whole time! What an incredible cast. Solid movie, but this is exactly what you get when you think of ""Aaron Sorkin drama on the Chicago 7"". This doesn't really break any new ground for Sorkin (it's no Social Network), but it's still fantastic. When he showed up I was shocked. [deleted] ""Found some."" Jerry Rubin actually described the trial as ""the Academy Award of protest.""  The quote is on his Wikipedia page. The whole Jerry Rubin quote is a follows:  


>The day we were indicted we had a champagne and grass party. We were thrilled. It was like receiving the Academy Award of Protest. Funny enough, that line was actually only slightly modified from the real trial. Yup. Started watching this movie at 1 AM w/ the intention of watching the first half that night and the second half the next morning and once I saw the opening scene I was like 'shit I'm not going to sleep til this is over' This was honestly the first time I saw how great an actor this guy is. When he won his oscar for Bridge of Spies, I was incredulous and thought Stallone should have won instead. Its like hes not even acting hes just so natural he was amazing I'd just re-watched Dunkirk on Saturday and then being surprised by him on Sunday on such an opposite role gave me a bigger perspective on him. I have a much bigger admiration for him now. Unbelievable performance. I had no idea who it was till I googled it halfway through. He’s fantastic in Wolf Hall as well. He plays Cromwell during Henry VIII’s reign. I went back and watched that scene after the movie ended. His frustration is the audience’s frustration. It was cathartic to watch him yell it. He was phenomenal. OP just got held in contempt of court. On the bright side the judge being such a flagrantly incompetent lunatic is what got the convictions and contempt charges overturned by the court of appeals. They had to tone down the judge.   
From another thread I commented the following:

The infamous Barnyard Epithet incident from the testimony of James D. Riordan on February 4, 1970:

>**MR. SCHULTZ:** Did you see where he went?  
**THE WITNESS:** He left with the head of the group that were carrying the flags.  
**MR. DELLINGER:** Oh, bullshit. That is an absolute lie.  
**THE COURT:** Did you get that, Miss Reporter?  
**MR. DELLINGER:** Let's argue about what you stand for and what I stand for, but let's not make up things like that.  
**THE COURT:** All of those remarks were made in the presence of the Court and jury by Mr. Dellinger.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** Sometimes the human spirit can stand so much, and I think Mr. Dellinger reached the end of his.  
**THE COURT:** I have never heard in more than a half a century of the bar a man using profanity in this court or in a courtroom.  
**MR. HOFFMAN:** I've never been in an obscene Court, either.  
**THE COURT:** I never have as a spectator or as a judge. I never did.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** You never sat here as a defendant and heard liars on the stand, your Honor.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Now, your Honor, I move that that statement--how dare Mr Kunstler--  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** I say it openly and fully, your Honor.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Your Honor, we had to sit with our lips tight, listening to those defendants, to those two defendants, Mr. Hayden and Mr. Hoffman, perjure themselves. I mean Davis and Hoffman.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** A little Freudian slip, your Honor.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Your Honor, I have no further direct examination.  
**MR. DELLINGER:** You're a snake. We have to try to put you in jail for ten years for telling lies about us, Dick Schultz.  
**MARSHAL JONESON:** Be quiet, Mr. Dellinger.  
**MR. DELLINGER:** When it's all over, the judge will go to Florida, but if he has his way, we'll go to jail. That is what we're fighting for, not just for us, but for all the rest of the people in the country who are being oppressed.  
**VOICES:** Right on.  
**THE COURT:** Take that man into custody, Mr. Marshal. Take that man into custody.  
**VOICES:** Right on, right on.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** Into custody?  
**THE COURT:** Into custody.

\[after the jury was discharged\]

>**THE COURT:** I have some observations to make here, gentlemen.Time and again, as the record reveals, the defendant Dave Dellinger has disrupted sessions of this court with the use of vile and insulting language. Today again he used vile and obscene language which, of course, is revealed by the record.I propose to try to end the use of such language if possible, and such conduct, by terminating the bail of this defendant.I do not, if I can help it, intend to permit such tactics to make a mockery out of this trial.I hereby, Mr. Clerk, terminate the bail of the defendant David Dellinger and remand him to the custody of the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Illinois for the remainder of this trial.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** Your Honor, is there not going to be any argument on this?  
**THE COURT:** No argument.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** I would like to say my piece. He is my client, and I think this is an utterly--

*(There is disorder in the courtroom.)*

>**MR. KUNSTLER:** You brought this on, your Honor. This is your fault. This is what happened in Chicago. You exerted the power, and I would like to argue the point.  
**THE COURT:** You won't argue the point.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** I will argue, your Honor, that your Honor's action is completely and utterly vindictive, that there is no authority that says because a defendant blurts out a word in court--  
**THE COURT:** This isn't the first word, and I won't argue this.  
**MR. DAVIS:** This court is bullshit.  
**THE COURT:** There he is saying the same words again.  
**MR. DAVIS:** No, I say it.  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** That was not even David Dellinger who made the last remark.  
**MR. SCHULTZ:** It was Davis, the defendant Davis who just uttered the last--  
**MR. RUBIN:** Everything in this court is bullshit.  
**MR. DAVIS:** I associate myself with Dave Dellinger completely, 100 percent. This is the most obscene court I have ever seen.  
**MR. RUBIN:** You are going to separate us. Take us, too.Take us all. Show us what a big man you are. Take us all.  
**MR. DAVIS:** Mr. Rubin's wife they are now taking--  
**MR. RUBIN:** Keep your hands off her. You see them taking away my wife?  
**MR. DAVIS:** Why don't you gag the press, too, and the attorneys, gag them?  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** Your Honor, there was no need for your action.

Note that this was near the end of the trail and even Schultz had taken to addressing errors by the Court. I kept thinking they made the judge that bad as some sort of thing to artificially increase the drama of the movie.

But then I looked him up and if anything they kind of softened him. He was a piece of human garbage. Couldn’t even get names right. Fun story:

One of my favorite musicians is Folk/Country singer John Prine, who passed away this year.

On one of his most famous songs, **""Illegal Smile""**, he's paranoid about being caught smoking weed and dreams ""Well I went to court and the judge's name was... Hoffman"". 

I never knew what that meant and just heard the music for the first time in months before seeing the movie.

He's talking about **that** Judge Hoffman. **Julius Hoffman**. Never knew this till today. The guy literally bound and gagged a black man in front of a courtroom. Please tell me that didn't happen in real life. After Umbridge in Harry Potter, I hated that character with contempt. Shows how good of an actor Frank Langella is. I forgot it was him and was seething in anger at the character. Ya know, ive never wanted to piss on someone's grave before but this man was, at least if this is remotely true, a massive piece of shit ""Just get started on the appeal"" The ending is something you would see in a movie within a movie from Charlie Kaufman when he makes a parody of Hollywood endings. It was sappy and cheesy as fuck. The judge being suddenly ""helpless"" and banging on the gavel non stop while yelling just threw me completely off of the movie that I had just enjoyed.

I feel for the actors involved. Any other ending would've been better. For anyone who liked him in this I'd highly recommend checking out Frost vs Nixon if you haven't already. Langella plays Nixon and he's fantastic. He got Joffrey-level hatred out of me in such a short time. Give that dude all the awards. It warms my heart that it was his favorite role he’s ever played. Very true. It’s a very large main cast and I felt like I understood everyone’s motivations and goals. The upcoming film Judas and the Black Messiah will make a nice companion piece it’s about Hampton’s assassination. Agreed. I get the desire for a triumphant ending but it just felt so jarring after the previous scene. I actually would have preferred a more somber climax to match their sentencing. What do you mean by 'made up ending'?  Did Tom really stand up and read the names of the fallen? 
Was it not sent to an appeals court where the Justice department declined to retry them?  I'm not being disingenuous here, I'm genuinely asking. The triumphant music was so over the top The movie was great, but that ending was Sorkin's worst writing ever. I wonder if Paramount forced than in (when producing the movie, originally). It was over the top, overly sentimental, too on the nose... I was fine with the ending; I loved it cheesy music and all!!! It was cathartic and we deserve it after the year we’ve had in the US. 

It felt like a trial for 2020 protestors, mirrors of the past of the cops beating hippies in the park, the teargas  .... We have Breonna Taylor, a moment that mirrored the past with the Fred Hampton execution by law enforcement and death announcement in the movie... and the end mirrored the senseless deaths of today, it felt like someone reading the names of Covid deaths in front of the crooked Judge ... the judge being forced to listen to every name ... it felt like that judge is our Trump. 

Loved it.  I Cried.  

I’m exhilarated as the movie was so entertaining, inspiring,  educational and even funny.... but I’m devastated realizing how much hasn’t changed in America in the 50 years since this Trial of the Chicago 7. 

10/10 movie I found the ending so jarring. I’m like crying for the nearly 5,000 people who had died during the trial, and they’re all triumphantly raising their fists as if they’ve won something? The whole thing was a miscarriage of justice and I can’t see what we were supposed to be cheering in that moment. It should have been way more somber. I feel like the judge was one of the worst villains ever. I don’t have words for him. What an awful human being. Reminded me of Social Network and Steve Jobs. Definitely one of the highlights of the movie it was a standout scene for Redmayne. Just curious, on ‘our blood,’ with an impartial judge, could those papers have been brought in as evidence? Or is that too much of a stretch? That was a standout sequence. Should get Redmayne and Rylance noms. I have criticized Eddie Redmayne enunciation before, I don't like him mumbling in other roles, here he is phenomenal it is like he projects his voice somewhat and it really works, Sacha is great in the scene too. Oh, that's an old joke I swear I just heard that joke in the West Wing and I died when it came up in this movie and he liked to say the f-word. a LOT It was a character based on him, he's never named.

Abbie Hoffman is also known for disrupting the set of The Who in Woodstock. It’s all so the same after 50 years. > Mark Rylance

He was fantastic as was Cohen as Abbie Hoffman.  I agree Rylance's performance was one of the best I've seen all year. His back and forth against Langella is fantastic. I think Rylance, Coen, and Abdul-Mateen will all get nominated. Redmayne is an academy darling so I can see him getting nominated too but I’d be surprised if they get 3 actors all in supporting. I got emotional too and so many people are adverse to cheesy scenes in movies, but honestly, cheesy moments like these happen in real life too. 

I know the scene was a bit of dramatic license, but still drove the point home that the whole trial and all of this was happening because young American men were being forced to go fight in a war and die. 

The only thing I didn't like was seeing Rennie Davis with his arm raised in the most goofy way possible. Thank you for this. Even if it is cheesy, it was a good reminder to the audience of what these men were actually fighting for. Hard to have an opinion nowadays without Reddit attacking it whole lol I agree. It doesn't matter that that's not what happened in real life. That was Sorkin telling you what should have happened because those men were what the 7 were fighting for all along. > One of the most confusing additions is David Dellinger punching the deputy, which did not happen in real life. Dellinger was a radical pacifist and this addition is offensive.

That is really confusing. I'm a Brit, so really have no knowledge of this event. 

That's massively shitting on that guys legacy as a pacifist. I'd assumed it actually happened, because it'd be mad to put that in a film based on real life if it hadn't happened. Fuck, that closing statement is amazing. I would have loved to hear Mark Rylance deliver that. Incredible to me, and it wasn't shown, was the Court (Hoffman) trying to suggest Kunstler was responsible. 

The judge robe moment:

>**THE COURT:** Where are the defendants?  
**THE COURT:** May the record show defendants Hoffman and Rubin came in at 1:28, attired in what might be called collegiate robes.  
**MR. RUBIN:** Judges' robes, sir.  
**A DEFENDANT:** Death robes.  
**THE COURT:** Some might even consider them judicial robes.  
**MR. RUBIN:** Judicial robes.  
**THE COURT:** Your idea, Mr. Kunstler? Another one of your brilliant ideas?  
**MR. KUNSTLER:** Your Honor, I can't take credit for this one.  
**THE COURT:** That amazes me. Man, Sorkin should have just shot that closing statement verbatim. Mark Rylance would've monologued the shit out of that ending. >I enjoyed the decision to humanize JGL by showing his internal struggle between his ethics and duty to the law- though I'm not sure as to the veracity of this.

According to this review, Schultz's portrayal in the movie is not true to what he was like irl: https://film.avclub.com/aaron-sorkin-finds-another-zingy-corny-courtroom-drama-1845175146

>While the real Richard Schultz has been described as a “pit bull” for his attack-dog reputation, Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays him as a conflicted, principled patriot, reluctant to even take the case; I really felt like Sorkin's West Wing politics were forced onto a real historical event that has serious contradictions with that kind of political view and it detracted from the movie. Great write up, agree 100% That closing statement should have been the end of the film. Great comment. How has no one mentioned that Bobby Seale was physically gagged for several days??? “Defense attorney Kunstler declared, ‘This is no longer a court of order, Your Honor, this is a medieval torture chamber.’” Source: https://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-6-4-the-case-of-the-defendant-who-was-bound-and-gagged Yeah Weiner was just treated as Sorkin’s quip outlet

Doesn’t mean I wasn’t amused by the quips. The 10 protestors leading thousands of undercover cops line after that sequence I thought landed really well >) One of the most confusing additions is David Dellinger punching the deputy, which did not happen in real life. Dellinger was a radical pacifist and this addition is offensive. 


This seems like a pretty fucking shitty thing to do. Damn.

Reading this I like the movie less now and wish they’d stuck more to real life events. While obviously different, I was strongly reminded of the intro (not prologue) to the Watchmen movie. In the sense that I haven't seen such a tight well made opening, establishing the whole context of a world/ movie/ society since it. This was well said. I enjoyed your perspective here. I had to pause the movie for a second when they did that to Bobby Seale. I was so upset and knew it could've happened and I was sickened to find out it did happen. Nobody deserves that kind of treatment, not in a court of law, not anywhere.

Definitely Joffrey levels of assholery. While I'm sure there were parts smoothed out for the screen, this felt timely and important at a time where people are protesting a government that refuses to hear the dialogue or admit wrongdoing. It is patriotic to protest: you care enough to push for change you want to see in the country It even ended on a freeze-frame. (Though that's an 80's thing, more or less.) The last five minutes were godawful. The rest of it I enjoyed quite a bit. I really liked SBC’s performance but his accent was way off for me. Who would you put as passable? Everyone seemed at least good > I believe I remember that egg joke from an episode of the westwing from Margaret to Leo

Spot on with the egg joke. Turns out there were a few callbacks. https://twitter.com/KevinTPorter/status/1317595206502371328 That person is real.... this is based on a true story. The actual judge was like that so yeah, they had a terrible judge. Jeremy Strong.  Our Number One Boy. 

“L to the OG” I felt the Joseph Gordon Levitt was wasted in that role.  He didn't really have a lot to do in that role that required such a skilled actor.  They could have gotten by with giving a lesser named actor some major screen time. Yes. It seemed intentional to get the judges tone across early, but still weird Sorkin did a good job not over indulging himself. There isn’t motor mouth dialogue and long monologues every few minutes and doesn’t feel preachy. He did a great job letting each character feel unique. Couldn’t have said it better myself! But I would’ve said Chutzpah. Cheers. From [Bobby Seale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Seale#cite_note-20) on Wikipedia:

>*During the trial, one of Seale's many vociferous protests led Judge* [*Julius Hoffman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Hoffman) *to have him bound and gagged,* *as commemorated in the song ""*[*Chicago*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_(Graham_Nash_song))*"" written by* [*Graham Nash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Nash) *and mentioned in the poem and song ""H2Ogate Blues"" by* [*Gil Scott-Heron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Scott-Heron)*.*

Yep. > There was really a bound and gagged defendant?

[Yuuuuuuup.](https://www.loc.gov/exhibitions/drawing-justice-courtroom-illustrations/about-this-exhibition/political-activists-on-trial/bobby-seale-bound-and-gagged/) There was even [a song](https://youtu.be/5BtxOubtOwc) by Graham Nash about this trial that I am stunned didn't play over the closing credits.

*Though your brother's bound and gagged*

*And they've chained him to a chair*

*Won't you please come to Chicago*

*Just to sing*

*In a land that's known as freedom*

*How can such a thing be fair?*

*Won't you please come to Chicago*

*For the help we can bring* Yes, but they let him gagged there for three days. They didn't immediately declare a mistrial. Slate has an article fact-checking the movie here:

https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/trial-chicago-seven-aaron-sorkin-accuracy-netflix.html

Seale was actually bound and gagged, but much of the rest is fiction. Unfortunately. Yes it was very true, but I dont believe the mistrial occurred that same day in real life. If you want a good summary of the absolute nonsense you can [review the overturned contempt charges](https://famous-trials.com/chicago8/1376-inredellinger). 

&#x200B;

Some highlights  [against William Kuntsler](https://famous-trials.com/chicago8/1377-kunstlercontempt) alone include:   


 

**MR. KUNSTLER:** When you interpret it as a laugh at you --

""**THE COURT:** Some people here don't seem to know about it.

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** No, but, your Honor, when you try to interpret a laugh as meaning you are the butt of a joke, then you react - -

""**THE COURT:** I will ask you to sit down. Did you hear me?

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** I just don't want to get thrown in my chair by the marshal, so I will have to sit down, but I just don't think it is fair to do that.

""**MR. HOFFMAN:** I laughed anyway.

""**THE COURT:** Will you be quiet, Mr. --

""**MR. HOFFMAN:** I laughed. It wasn't Jerry. It was me.

""**THE COURT:** Did you get that, Miss Reporter?

""**MR. HOFFMAN:** \- - at that ruling. I laughed. He didn't.

""**THE COURT:** That was Mr. Dellinger.

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** That was not Mr. Dellinger.""  


  
and also  


 

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** May I go and tell him?

""**THE COURT:** I ask you to sit down.

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** Your Honor, just to tell him so that, if the Government is going to permit him to testify - -

""**THE COURT:** I have had enough of your insults this morning.

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** Your Honor, this being insulting.

""**THE COURT:** You were this morning.

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** I was not insulting. I told you the truth this morning. I told you what the New York Times said - -

""**THE COURT:** All right.

""**MR. KUNSTLER:** about the refusal to put a witness on the stand.

""**THE COURT:** Sit down, sir, or we will arrange to have you put down."" I agree 100 percent! It was a perfect movie imo, rare that I get this excited for a movie these days.  

10/10 Saw it yesterday basically while all the drama was happening in DC. watched it today, great movie and the reading of the names at the end had me in tears Rylance’s performance actually made me proud of the real person all the way through.  Man did I feel everything he was feeling!!! He was an all-star lawyer in those days, defending civil right activists like Malcolm X and MLK.  There should be an entire television series about him alone and Rylance should star! He looks and acts so much like the real lawyer.  

It’s so ridiculous how much of the dialog was real from the trial- I shouldn’t be shocked at that judges blatant bias but I was a bit.  SBC, Jeremy Strong, Keaton and of course Sorkin were all brilliant. 

10/10 movie. Its a great feeling when youre watching a movie and a half an hour in you think to yourself ""man I am loving this"" Well said! I was glued to the TV and never felt a lull in its pace. [deleted] Having Dellinger punch that guy in court was so offensive. And the undercover bimbo FBI agent that was trying to be the voice of reason over these guys was so gross. I didn't hate the movie but those two points really bothered me. Decent assessment. I didn’t have huge problems with the movie. I wasn’t alive during the trial as I was born a few years later but I’ve met all the defendants in the 1980’s most during a get together during rehearsals for a play about the trial.
 I thought Jerry Rubin, Dellinger, and Hayden were fictionalized the most to their detriment. There were also significant others of the defendants that did a lot of the groundwork for them. Jerry wasn’t this lonely guy vulnerable to the feminine wiles of an FBI agent. That was fiction.

I didn’t feel like Abbie’s charisma showed but that’s subjective. I can forgive the accent. I don’t think anyone could be cast well as Abbie so that might forfeit my critique. At the very least, the movie wasn’t attacking him. It felt old fashioned but it fits with the throwback vibe. Rylance and Yahya are probably in pretty good shape for noms. Rylance has some of my favorite moments for sure. 
>My only problem with it was the ending with everyone standing up and the inspirational music while the Judge suddenly is helpless to stop it. Felt very ""Robert Zumeckis"". But that's a neatpick. 

Sorkin is very cheesey and overly optimistic in a lot of his writing. I think that's why his best work is usually when he's collaborating with someone like Fincher to knock it down a few pegs > But that's a neatpick

I think you meant to say ""nitpick"" but that is a neat comment so I guess it works. I think Redmayne could get a nom for the same reason SBC could. For some people watching, something this subdued from either of them is uncharted territory Amen to that. I felt like this could have taken place in our own time. he became rubin. amazing acting Apparently it was made up :( Was he unlikeable though? I thought he was allways just slightly sympethatic towards The movement and questioned the side he was on. Only so much that it was ambiguous and not clear >Sacha Baron Cohen admitted he was ""terrified"" of having to do an American accent for the film. He had used a few different variations of the accent before for comedic reasons, but never for a dramatic role. He knew Abbie Hoffman had a unique voice, having a Massachusetts accent but also having gone to school in California, and was worried he would ""sound wrong"". Aaron Sorkin had to reassure him that the role was ""not an impersonation, but an interpretation"", which Baron Cohen claimed did not help much.

From imdb It’s basically the same accent he used for Nira Cane in his Who Is America? Show which really is the only other time I’ve heard him use an American accent so maybe that’s the only one he knows how to do? 

Funny enough, I listened to the audio recordings of the real Abbie Hoffman & I think the spirit of the voice was definitely there. Yeah I agree, the accent reeaally threw me off even though I liked his performance overall. It sounded like Chicago mixed with his natural English accent which made for a weird mix Bobby Seale was charged with the same crime as the 7 but was later aquited due to a mistrail based on the denial of his right to attorney.  They were orginialy called the Chicago 8, or conspiracy 8. I really appreciated his role and his speech he gives Tom and Kuntsler at prison. It doesn’t just remind them that he’s fighting a totally different fight but it reminds the viewer as well. I loved this movie. Saw the trailer and was intrigued even though I knew nothing about it. 10 minutes in and I’m like ‘this has to be Sorkin...’ and sure enough. Every fucking beat of it was perfect. I have a new favorite courtroom movie now and respect for Sacha JGL's two huge scenes were so good (his intro and his reaction to Bobby Seale being bound and gagged) I forgot how good he was. Mangrove is so good and an interesting counter/comparison to this. My take as an attorney: he was refusing to represent Seale because allowing Seale to go through the trial without an attorney was such a flagrant miscarriage of justice that it was going to provide Seale with additional grounds to have the trial overturned if he was convicted. If he would have opted to rep Seale, Seale wouldn’t have been able to argue that he was actively denied representation in court. My understanding was that in the time period being covered by the movie, Bobby was calling for a mistrial citing (among other things) that he was being denied representation. 
This is why he was having to go out of his way to make it clear that the trial had moved forward without his lawyer and any suggestion that he was being represented along with the other seven would weaken that claim. Was it that he legally couldn’t? I thought that it might be that Bobby wanted his trial severed from the others and postponed until his lawyer was well, which it should’ve been u/turcois While there were a lot of good answers here they are incorrect. 

Note that Seale attempted to file a motion for self-representation and repeatedly requested to cross examine the witnesses. This wasn't to make some sort of the point, nor was it, as u/DowntownYorickBrown suggested so create some sort of scenario by which to appeal on the grounds of a miscarriage of justice.  


Seale had an attorney but that man was in the hospital. Seale rejected Kunstler's offer thereafter because ***Seale was representing himself*** during the trial. However, the Court kept forgetting or simply could not understand that so kept holding Seale in contempt. Due to this Seale *wasn't being denied presentation because his attorney was absent*, **he was being denied representation because he wasn't being allowed to speak in court**. And Barr I mean, it's definitely a ham fisted message aimed at the current administration. He toned down what they did to seale. It's fucking wrong Abbie Hoffman spoke at my college in the mid-1980s. The library didn’t have “Steal This Book” so I stole a copy of “Soon to be a Major Motion Picture” and asked him to autograph it.

He asked me, “Did you really steal this from the library?” Of course, I told him.

He inscribed it: “To ___, owner of stolen property” with his autograph. yeah, but to be honest Sacha Baron Cohen impressed me even more. I knew he is a good actor, but that great? Wow. Anyway, fantastic cast (maincast and all the secondary as well) Yeah, this was the first time where it wasn't Eddie Redmayne just playing Eddie Redmayne. I'm not usually a fan. I thought the film's centrist politics ultimately clashed with its portrayal of leftists. Its essentially an outsider looking in, a ""white moderate's"" take on protesting and activism. 

Ultimately, like most centrists, he's afraid of portraying radical politics at all, or failing that, in a good light. So of course he tones down the politics of many of the characters. Of course he portrays people to the left of him as ""not as sensible or agreeable"" because that is his ideology speaking - not any kind of objective fact. Of course he will make a milquetoast message of unity. Even portraying one side as ""pragmatic"" is an ideological statement, and assume they share the same goals when anyone with an understanding of history or politics can correctly identify the left and center as bitter political enemies. This kind of faulty political foundation is what the entire film stands on. 

And the movie suffered for it. I would have liked to actually see Hoffman's hostility to the court rather than the milquetoast we got. Sorkin's centrism ultimately whitewashes and sanitizes the whole affair. His insistence on ""showing good people on both sides"" with the prosecutor also muddles the message. Then you got Sorkin again touting the superiority of the serious, moderate liberal . . . in the context of 2020 when decades of serious, moderate liberal approach nothing has really changed. Plus the ending, by god the ending. Threw away the entire message of the movie to invent a feelgood scene where the good guys win and happily ever after. ""Is this a good movie or not"" -- to answer that question, I say that's entirely up to you! If you loved it, then you love it, I don't see anything wrong with that. That's the beauty of all art, we all take different things away from it.

I did think this movie was ""good,"" but I wouldn't go as far as to say it's ""great."" For context, the writer/director of this film Aaron Sorkin is known for his rapid-fire dialogue & wit. You know that conversations that he writes can't happen in real-life, it almost feels like music the way everything is paced. 

So to me, in The Social Network (not sure if you've seen that), that worked out perfectly because I think David Fincher found a way to make Sorkin's ""music"" really pop off the screen. But in The Trial of the Chicago 7 (I just watched this for the first time last night) it just felt a little too ""clean"" and vanilla, and I felt that there weren't too many creative risks to make the movie feel all the more profound. The beats happened exactly when they were supposed to -- I didn't feel the intensity that I thought I would have given the intense subject matter. 

But the actors' performances I thought were pretty great (special shoutouts to Sacha Baron Cohen & Yahya Abdul-Mateen). 

All in all, I did like this movie, but wouldn't be running to the hills saying it's one of the best movies of 2020. Though the timeliness & relevance of this movie works in its favor -- it packs a bit more of a punch now than if it were released 10 years ago. He didn’t though. After the appeal they didn’t give him any new cases. He saw out the final ones he was presiding with over before he retired and died a year later. What did they change? Yes this. I reckon, In decades to comes I bet I would’ve watched this movie like 20 times 

Just like I have already seen west wing 10 times. I liked this movie, and I think it's an important story that needs to be told, but I'm pretty saddened by how they portrayed Harden and others.

Like you said, having Dellinger punch that marshall was dumb. I would argue almost insulting.

Having the protesters try to take the hill, instead of them already being on the hill and getting beat by the cops, muddies the water on whether or not they started the riots. Of course the movie itself has a part where they literally say the cops started it, so I hope that's what most people take away from it.

I just wish Sorkin didn't sugarcoat the narrative to make it palatable for both sides. It's as if he had make the left more flawed to not look biased or something. Abbie wanted to focus more on changing culture through his monologues and mass gatherings in order to end the war, and facilitate a cultural shift in the country.

Tom Hayden recognized that even if you change the culture itself, you still need the legislative power to make real systemic change.  That's why he says he isn't looking to end the war.  He's certainly passionate about trying to end the conflict, but it's just one objective of a grand plan to work from w/i the framework of the system to make positive changes.  Ending the war itself doesn't change Nixon being in power, or his subordinates carrying out his will.

It's similar to the state of current political affairs where once again we have a Commander in Chief frequently abusing his power, disparaging anyone they don't agree w/, and threatening legal action at a moment's notice to make examples out of them. They aren’t really portrayed accurately in the film. They made a mockery of the process and didn’t take the trial seriously. Also, they didn’t hate each other or were at each other’s throats. 

They were just young yippee don't know if you'll see this being so a whole month later, but I actually bumped out how I felt Tom Hayden was treated a little too unfairly for that detail (and whether it also happened in real life or not). Sure when the sitting idea was broached by the one more mousey of the 7, Hayden was in, yeah makes sense, sounds more than fair. But then several minutes of real time go by where other machinations of the trial (many of them absurd) are going on, the idea simply slipped out of his mind, his rising was nothing more than muscle memory. Hoffman and Rubin were the ones of the 7 whose full intention was to play up every possible circus aspect of the trial, so of course the plan never left their minds for a second once originated. Hayden was the one more than any of them that was trying to also ""properly"" engage with the trial as a key defendant, it's the most understandable thing in the world he could've momentarily just spaced about it and stood out of habit. Most other people could've made the same mistake. He's like looked at as a total pariah for it when he didn't at all mean to do it. If THIS COURTROOM made you furious and upset about the justice system, do yourself a favour and NEVER watch When They See Us on Netflix. Makes this film look like some Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney shit. Because her carrying that flag means she's disrespecting what they think it means. They feel that they have to put her in her place. They were conservatives Because it's supposed to be their country not hers. I think they didn't wanted to associate America as whole with what those people were doing ie protest against govt Because in real life she was holding a soviet flag, not an American one. I was surprised how toned down the Chicago 7 and Seale were. Hoffman and Rubin were more goofballs during the actual trial than the film's depiction. It took me a bit to adjust to Redmayne’s voice but he really won me over fantastic performance. Sacha being incredibly theatrical at first and then breaking it down to show his real thoughts was a site to see. I think it is. You don't really need to grasp the details or nuances, this was written as a pretty clear-cut scrappy underdogs vs. big corrupt government courtroom drama. It's got the trademark Sorkin zip and wit, very fun to watch. History never stopped :/ It's a common theme, regardless of the era. The screenplay was written in 2007. But Sorkin didn’t convey the overall sentiment. He liberalized the whole event, framing the 7’s (and Bobby Seales) fight for systemic change as a fight against a few bad actors. A person who knew nothing about the real life story would leave this thinking that the accused were fighting to save the established system, not dismantle it. Artistic license is different from whitewashing history and documentaries can be just as fictionalized as feature films. A similar moment happened in the middle of the trial. About a month into the trial, the defendants placed a US and South Vietnamese flag on the table and read aloud the names of the dead. Redmayne's accent was amazing. His voice was just completely different than his normal British one. I would have totally thought he was an actual American if I didn't know him. I can't say the same about other British actors. BostoFrenchItalian? It was really all over the place I feel like he gave up on it halfway through. that list of names had to come to light at some point! he sure spent the whole whole movie writing them down. you saw how old he was there were probably hundreds like him if i had to guess most judges were like him bc they were appointed during times of segregation and such. It's what Mitch McConnell's been doing the entire time Trump's been in office, just packing those courts tighter and tighter with judges probably just like Julie here > Im sorry but how the fuk did a guy like Julius fucking Cuntman become a judge?

You're sure as shit going to be asking yourself that question over and over again over the next twenty years - mark my words. It may not be popular with older members of the Academy who can remember (and not fondly) the people depicted, and know that much of the film is fiction. His Court Room scene he answered the judge in the same tone and vocal range as Beatljuce, threw me for a second lol >This is pretty conclusive evidence that Sorkin shouldn't be directing

This. I share a similer sentiment about the movie, although I enjoyed it. But I actually interpreted Hoffman's statement at the stand as him biting his tongue and trying to not get them convicted, and that it wasn't a heartfelt statement but maybe I misinterpreted that. It's not a documentary. It's a movie. As far as it can get to what it wants to say, I'd say it was a pretty terrific movie. There were definitely a ton of Sorkinisms in there.  The egg joke, social revolution vs real revolution, priorities vs winning elections... lots more.  I'm currently on my first watch of the West Wing so they stood way out there. I was definitely shocked by the way Bobby Seale was gagged in court, and when it happened in the movie I thought it was a metaphor to represent the abuse of power by the judge. Turns out it was something that actually happened. Many are.  Justice in the USA is broken.

Try the Georgia vs Fenton case: https://new.legalreader.com/wp-content//uploads/sites/3/2016/07/transcript.pdf  

helped made infamous by the rick and morty crew:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vN_PEmeKb0&list=LLKH0MTYxKw-QQrjHLgto7LQ&index=3780 I could have used another 20 mins really enjoyed it but I think the ending was a bit abrupt. Should have had one more scene between Hoffman on the stand and Hayden reading the names. I thought the cast was great all around, but Cohen and Strong definitely killed it.  John Carroll Lynch was great as well - hes such an underrated character actor. Conspiracy in the Streets: The Extraordinary Trial of the Chicago Seven

Is a good one and I remember it giving background on the people and their actual politics. Wait until you hear about prosecutors He did gag Bobby Seale so that's all I need to know he was a terrible person. After watching this, Watchmen and Lovecraft Country, I can confirm that as an American, our schools did a lousy job at teaching us American History. I had no idea this or the Tulsa massacre happened. You should watch The Spy, another one of SBC's serious roles, and he kills it there.

Also about Jeremy Strong, personally I think he nailed ""The stoner"" vibe. At the start of the trail, I was like this dude is stoned, later it was revealed that the character actually was. It also irritates me because  i’m pretty sure this was in the 70s or 80s and I guarantee people were still saying that happened over 20 years ago why ago we’re all equal and everything is fair. Yet there were still racist and biased judges that were appointed to the bench during before laws were put in place. And when they visited Seale in jail and he explained how different their situations were and pointed out the first thing pushing them to be so liberal was to upset their fathers while for Seale he literally could be killed because of his color and that’s why he wanted reform. So I guess you are a fan of the government denying constitutional rights to its inhabitants.... That’s what Abbie sounded like

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gcXKeuOW3lQ SBC talked about how he nervous to tackle the accent, because the real Abbie Hoffman was from Massachusetts but also lived in California (I think), so his voice was pretty distinct. I would have been fine if this was another hour longer. Felt like he was pressed for time. I saw the trailer and still forgot he was in it lol. When they were talking about the Attorney General and how they should've called him from the beginning or something like that, I was literally trying to remember which actor from the beginning they were talking about Exactly. His brevity lent even more gravitas to the importance of the former AG’s role in this and made it resonate even that much more. Tbf, Stallone absolutely *should* have won that Oscar I saw Rylance in a Broadway show some years ago and that man is truly a force of nature. The end scene was basically just this wild drum solo on a huge drum and I’ve rarely ever been so riveted by anything I’ve seen in a theatre. Immense talent. He was incredible in Bridge of Spies, elevated every scene he's in. And he was sharing most of his screentime with Tom Hanks! One count. It’s more the thought that there have been and still are judges like him who determine the fate of everyday people. He didn't have a great reputation amongst Chicago's lawyers even before this case.  They knew he was abrasive and confrontational and struggled to stay objective long before this case. I just read that in real life, that judge was born in 1895. It makes total sense, he's in his 70's during a trial in 1969. But it just took me back when I read it. 1895!!! That is forever ago. He was a fascist. Now *THIS* would've been interesting to show in the film, (although basically worthless) it would've really outlined the judge as even more crazy than it already showed. 

Side note: I wonder if the doctors/psychiatrists that 
Kunstler said he wanted in the court, ended up doing anything about the state of the judge Holy shit apparently [according to time](https://time.com/5900527/trial-of-the-chicago-7-true-story/) hoffman did this

>And when he was finally sentenced and given a $5,000 fine, he called out to the judge, “Could you make that three-fifty?

The man was a fucking visionary. [https://time.com/5900527/trial-of-the-chicago-7-true-story/](https://time.com/5900527/trial-of-the-chicago-7-true-story/) Seale was gagged for 3 days, they dialed down a lot... Yup, I believe they didn't show some of his even worst moments. He actually did everything portrayed here, and more. I believe towards the end of the trial he even ordered Abbie, Rubin, and Kunstler's hair cut. Man I just googled him to see how similar the actor looked to him and dear god he even looks like an insufferable asshole.

https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/chicago-illinois-u-s-district-court-judge-julius-hoffman-news-photo/515302136 right! In real life he forced them all to get haircuts because he didn't like their long hair...wtf He was around 75 when the trial took place, he was VERY old school and borderline senile. They picked him mostly because he would never side for hippies. It backfired, as his incompetence cost the convictions on appeal. He didn't try to get the names right I watched the film last night having never heard of this trial, and then today on the radio that song came on during a tribute to John Prine, who I'd never heard of before. That lyric stood out, was a strange coincidence! RIP John. Such a gift to the world My husband is a huge Prine fan and I just BLEW HIS MIND with this fact. Thanks for sharing that!! It was actually for 3 days of the trial in real life. That guy played Dolores Umbridge? Skeletor has now been bumped to the seceond least sympathetic character played by Langella. It’s all true. He was truly this terrible, and then some. Some other commenters in this thread have posted evidence if you’d like to dig around. He was horrible and represents everything that’s wrong with our justice system. “Directed by Robert Zemeckis” By far the best film Nixon performance IMO. Yea..

They just needed to tone it down. You can have that ending just take the music down a ton. Its too Hollywood > As for the film’s grand finale, in which Tom Hayden uses his allocution statement to read the names of the Americans who died in the Vietnam War while the trial was being conducted, it never happened. On Oct. 15, 1969, the defendants did attempt to observe the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam by reading the names of some of the war dead from both sides, but it seems to have been David Dellinger actually reading the names. (Abbie Hoffman got into a tug of war with a marshal trying to confiscate the North Vietnamese flag he’d brought.) Hayden gave two allocution statements during the trial—one for the initial charges and one for the contempt charges Hoffman brought—and used both to give speeches, but didn’t speak about the war dead.
In real life, Rennie did not keep a notebook in which he recorded the names of all the Americans killed in the Vietnam War since he was arrested; that was invented to set up Tom Hayden’s big scene.

https://slate.com/culture/2020/10/trial-chicago-seven-aaron-sorkin-accuracy-netflix.amp If they completely gutted that it would have been 100 times better

For a movie that was so well edited that was such an odd choice You dont think Sorkin is capable of being over the top, overly sentimental, and too on the nose, all by himself? The ending felt like it was written in the 90s. The slow pan out with that font all felt very 90s Disney to me. The judge yelling order over the cheering crowd felt like a scene out of a parody movie. I cringed really hard at that moment I would have preferred that it did not feel carthatic. This was a travesty of a trial and we should have left the film feeling frustrated and angry We got robbed of Michael Keaton's screentime thanks to that asshole smh 100% reminded me of the Zuckerberg/Eduardo argument in Social Network, as well as the Jobs/Sculley scene in Steve Jobs. All incredibly written scenes but also complimented by the scores, editing and performances wonderfully. Sorkin learned from the best. [deleted] He's specifically named in the credits. I loved Townshend's response to that event after the fact, that he actually agreed with what Hoffman was saying but was just angry that he went up on stage like that. What blows my mind is most of the filming was done in 2019. The movie felt way too relevant for everything thats gone on in 2020 I thought it was meant to intentionally be an allusion to it. Turns out it was just a coincidence Cohen's accent was very strange.  He had the right presence, but I'd be incredibly surprised if he got an Oscar nod for such a weird accent.

[The real Abbie Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4LJKSMVFPo). Langella should get a nod. I do see how its cheesy in a sense since he repeats the 'brief' comment a few times before starting, but they did mention it earlier so it wasn't a huge turn to left field at least. It's really inexcusable.

Sorkin had the opportunity to show that it doesn't matter if you are a ""clean cut"" family-man who swears off any form of violence - you will be viewed in the same company of what they consider radical troublemakers. 

But instead Sorkin has Dellinger abandon a cornerstone of his moral identity and adds a scene of his son looking on teary-eyed in disapproval.

Perhaps he was trying to show how people are pushed to violence after being mistreated so badly - even pacifists. But this message was illustrated with the larger protest and could have been conveyed without shitting on that man's legacy. Seriously – that wasn't dramatic enough for Sorkin? [deleted] Thanks for looking that up. The article you linked perfectly encapsulates what I was trying to say.

There is value, I guess, in that decision to show that many unjust acts were perpetrated by ""good"" men just following orders. 

I really wish this movie was more firmly rooted as a serious drama (while still letting the actions of Hoffman/Rubin provide moments of levity). Sorkin was successful in his tone from an entertainment standpoint - but it doesn't do justice to the real life events. I actually got the notion that he had a lot of contempt for the protestors. I interpreted the scene with his daughters as a demonstration that he didnt align with their ideals at all, despite his youth. 

I’m sad to see this wasnt the case. Can you explain what you mean? (honest question) The fist five minutes more than made up for those weird last five minutes imo A fair amount of people didnt have enough screen time for me to really say they were good as with any movie that has a large cast. Keaton comes to mind. Nothing wrong with his performance and he certainly hits his marks.  Just nothing to write home about. John carrol lynch also didnt have enough to do to really give a great performance. Same with Levitt. I think what they meant is; a lot of times in these movies they take a lot of creative liberties and add or make things up to make it more dramatic and shocking.

Apparently, his portrayal in the movie was pretty accurate to real life, maybe even **toned down.**  
For example; he also ordered the barbers at the county jail to cut off the hair of the lawyers and the defendants because he thought it was too long.

The saddest and scariest part is, after all of that, still, 80% of Americans agreed with the prosecution/court and felt the demonstrators were to blame/guilty rather than the police. unfortunately the judge still continued overseeing cases after being given an unfavorable survey by his peers. the movie should have not pretended there was some righteous retribution in the outro You’ve got to be a killer It was also a little funny that the undercover cop plays Roman’s “GF” in the show Dude be the OG It's a smaller role, but there's some nuance. His character is trying to do the job he's been tasked with, but he clearly has personal reservations. So JGL has to both believably command the room and telegraph his own misgivings. This comes out especially in the scene when Seale is gagged.

Plus audiences typically know JGL as the good guy, which I think helps pull off this tug of allegiances.

Notice they went with a lesser name for his partner, the other prosecutor. That character was more one-dimensional. I don't remember what the exact line is but it seemed like an actual editing error, he was cut off mid-line and then said the exact same thing again with a sudden tone shift that made it clear it was a different take. [deleted] jesus fucking christ that court sketch is brutal, cannot imagine being in that room (or what Seale must have felt) The end credits song was terribly out of place. The fact that Abbie Hoffman was toned *down* for the movie is wild to me. The ending was terrible but other than that it was great. We watched this last night and it takes on a completely new context after DC. Great movie! The scene that's the actual dramatic crux of the movie is where it's revealed that Eddie Redmayne meant to say ""our blood"" in his speech to the protestors but was too vague about the grammar, so the protestors interpreted his speech as a command to attack, which they did. This directly led to the cops taking off their badges and beating Eddie and co. through the restaurant window.

After Eddie's grammar mishap reveal, Sacha Baron Cohen even made a whole deal about how Eddie Redmayne is a good writer but actually always fucks up his possessive pronouns (or whatever it was). Between this and Waiting for the Barbarians if Rylance doesn't get a nom it'll be a crime I think this is the sort of true story that is very well suited to Sorkin's style, because it's one where the ""good guys"" win in the end by maintaining the moral high ground, and the ""bad guys"" end up losing because the wider audience of the world sees their bad behavior for what it is. That's a very reductive summary but it's basically what happened with the Trial of the Chicago 7 - the convictions all got overturned because the judge was so demonstrably biased.

Even though it's based on a true story, it's got that Sorkin fantasy/wish fulfilment/escapist flavor to it. And honestly I'm fine with a slice of that kind of escapism in a world where people keep doing terrible stuff in plain view and getting away with it. The Sorkin/Fincher pairing really is perfect. They both flawlessly complement each other’s strengths and cover each other’s weaknesses. Only other Director/Screenwriter combo I like as much is Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman. Absolutely agree. I love his writing but when he doesn't have an equally talented peer to keep him in check he tends to ""overindulge"", you could say. When he has someone willing to really challenge him though, on every word, he makes some great stuff. This is why I couldn't stand the Newsroom. Basically every episode was some variation of ""Newsman says something profound... and then everyone clapped."" *Sustained!* It is. Definitely an interesting choice for the role, because I think as an audience we're just naturally sort of conditioned to like or be sympathetic towards Levitt. Maybe Sorkin was hoping to challenge the collective unconscious thing by casting an actor people typically like (and want to like) and upsetting that. I think Levitt is just naturally too likeable to pull off that tightrope act though. Interesting, thanks for providing that! As someone from Boston I know it’s not the easiest accent. I think it probably would have been better/less distracting if he’d gone with a more general American accent. Ah, that makes sense. Thank you! > he was refusing to represent Seale 

Bobby Seale fired Kunstler before the actual trial began and chose his own representation, Charles Garry, who was on retainer for the Black Panthers. Seale wanted a continuance until he could have his lawyer, or to represent himself. He was denied both. But he didn't refuse. He told Bobby he is there for him if he needs him. Bobby didn't want Kunstler as his lawyer. That's how I got it anyway. A lot of what you're saying here is probably on the money, the question is whether the intention was to make them more palatable to the broadest possible audience (it's always a product at the end of the day, sadly) or whether it was to further Sorkin's own political agenda. The characters were certainly more glossy and Hollywood than their real-life counterparts. Ideologically speaking too, as you say.

Personally, I felt that being less dogmatic in its representation of The Chicago Eight and espousing any one voice as 'the correct one' helped convey the message of the film. Maybe the choice to try and make Shultz sympathetic in the end did a feel a little forced and schlocky, but would that many people have really sat out on the honouring of dead teenage soldiers? (In a courtroom? Quite possibly.) That said, I didn't find Hoffman to be 'less agreeable' than Hayden, nor any of the main eight any more-or-less sensible than the rest. Perhaps others would feel more passionately opposed to one over the other, though I fear those viewers may have their own biases and missed the point somewhat, in a similar vein to someone who watches and roots for the prosecutors.

Of course, that's all relative to what you think the film's ultimate message is. I can't say I share your sentiment on the left and centre being 'bitter enemies', but I suppose our understanding of that point hinges on our own selective definitions of each term.  
For example, I'm no great fan of neoliberalism or communism. I say I'm a centrist in so much as I'm very wary about factional politics and radicals, which is not to say I always disagree with them. I also said it at the end as a funny little joke. >	Of course he portrays people to the left of him as ""not as sensible or agreeable"" because that is his ideology speaking - not any kind of objective fact. 

This wasn’t really my takeaway at all. He gives Hoffman the last word in the argument between him and Hayden, and I felt like he was allowing Hoffman a slight victory by revealing him as more serious and strategic than he initially lets on. Really, from what I’ve researched, not a lot. The reading of Vietnam War victims was true to an extent. It didn’t happen at the end of the trial, but it did happen. Just occurred at an earlier time. It was cut off by the judge, as is totally believable. By many accounts, the judge was worse than what the film showed. Also, the prosecutor was not known to be sympathetic to the defendants. Bobby Seale, the chairman of the black panthers, was in reality bound and gagged in a US district court room for THREE DAYS before his mistrial. Abbie Hoffman was a huge antagonist and even more so than the film showed. In many ways, the movie dulled down how truly dramatic this case was. In others, it was dramatized. Overall, a fair representation of an increasingly believable event in our nations history. Yeah that's definitely worse. It's one of the best but also most horrifying miniseries I've seen. I could not watch two episodes in a row, made me sick. True.  90% of the time watching this is was mostly enraged.  Sorkin did a great job. Late to this thread but, I can say I just watched this film as someone that had no idea about this trial or anyone in it - and I did not leave this film thinking this group wanted to save the established system at all. It was pretty clear they were incredibly angry and driven *at* the current establishment and were all willing to get their hands dirty to fundamentally change or dismantle it, despite the fact that their individual approaches might have been different or dissonant. sounded like NY Jewish/Chicago/Ali G Chekhov’s list for sure haha. Well, the film stripped away most of the actual socialist beliefs the characters held and made their activism all about opposing the war in Vietnam, a position that became retroactively popular over time. >This is pretty conclusive evidence that Sorkin shouldn't be directing.

Sounds more to me like circumstantial evidence that he shouldn't make documentaries. The movie was an effective and entertaining drama. Yeah i felt that too. SBC's portrayal Hoffman made him out to be pretty radical it was even worse. IRL he was gagged for 3 days. The guy freaks me out ever since Zodiac. I love seeing him in things and he is a great actor but he has this sinister quality to him now. He also had him gagged for several days, not just part of one. Almost like they purposefully choose not to teach about events where certain people were attacked, framed, or brutalized with no repercussions for the people who did it Yeah this is literally our lives while it's just their rebellion Oo! One of the suggested videos right after was used in the movie! Glad to find out this line was actually his.

https://youtu.be/h4LJKSMVFPo Agreed.  Especially since we all know that was Stallone's last shot at winning an Oscar. He stayed on the bench until he died. By the end, they weren't giving him new matters because he was so deranged, but he kept running the stuff he already had. Its nuts. Listen to the podcast series “Serial” where a reporter hangs out in the Cleveland courthouse for a year. One of the highlights is a judge ordering someone not to have any more kids. This is why stacking the courts with political judges is a really big fucking deal that more people should care about. That's exactly why he was chosen to run this case though. It really highlights the dangers of a political AG such as Barr and political judges. [https://time.com/5900527/trial-of-the-chicago-7-true-story/](https://time.com/5900527/trial-of-the-chicago-7-true-story/)  He confused Woodstock with something from India, enough said. I think you mean you were *taken aback*.  To say ""it took me back"" implies that you were alive in 1895 and personally remember it yourself.  I'm going to assume you're not more than 125 years old and that instead you meant that it was shocking that the judge was born then. I'm not sure that the exchanges would have made good TV - as shown in these  \[historical reanacement\] audio recordings, like this [exchange between the Court and Bobby Seale](https://youtu.be/_ENAMIqEU_w?t=2588) it is emotional and incredible but takes a while, but does not say, further the plot. [Here is the infamous exchange about who is representing Seale.](https://youtu.be/_ENAMIqEU_w?t=2722)

&#x200B;

As far as I know, the comment about a doctor was flippant, there was never one in court or gallery that observed the judge. *3 DAYS????* But still that alone would be grounds for why the fuck should this guy be making decisions.  Technically if he isn't saying your name right, you shouldn't have to listen to him that would show how good of an actor he is for sure If you’re curious look up interviews with Langella about Skeletor, he genuinely loved that character and wanted more than anything to play him again Langella played Nixon in the stage show version over 150+ times before the movie was ever made. He won the Tony for it and it shows in the film. That's Aaron Sorkin for you. He always does this kind of thing in otherwise fantastic work. The West Wing is another perfect example. Overall excellent, but occasionally way too over the top and sappy to where it detracts from the legitimate message. Ah gotcha, thanks. The Viet Cong? But they're the BAD GUYS!

I'm sorry, as a middle American, I like my beer cold, my endings happy, and morals anything BUT ambiguous.

Lets see what Michael Bay has to offer. The scene still works in my opinion. The whole riots were about the war. Obviously it's tough to do what they did in court in real life. I don't mind Hollywood magic done tastefully. Doesn't really sound like him 


/s Usually when he does it the writing is better lmao. It feels cheap to say it, but it was a West Wing ending. We were hit over the head with the reality of that travesty of a trial for 110 minutes in the movie, and not in a bad way.  No one watching doesn’t get the point, and draw parallels to today.  The watcher can see how little has changed in the 50 years since the trial and be frustrated. 

I say give me that end moment to cry and to focus on what the film was about for those men in that time.  Of course it’s more complicated than just opposing the Vietnam war, as the movie showed, but for me it worked. 

Loving the ending style is my personal preference in this moment in time. We don’t always have to feel like crap when the credits roll in order for a film to make an impact.  Just my opinion, I think I deserved the feel-good ending. It didn’t take away from all I learned through the movie. I still came away feeling frustrated and angry. For me at least, that edge wasn't blunted by the ending. It was a nice moment, but the entire film was a reminder of how the truth is often completely irrelevant when the powers-that-be have determined how they want things to proceed. And these were defendants who at least had competent and passionate lawyers, and who eventually had their verdict overturned. For every situation like that, there are SO many more where people just get thrown in jail to rot for life. I certainly didn't feel uplifted at the end thinking about that. Himself? Yeah, reading the room perfectly. 

I really liked all the performances in this I was really impressed by his performance in that scene. He did a great job showing the thoughts going through Hoffman’s head and sort of peeling back who he is behind all the theatrics. It was definitely a good point and needed to be brought up, but having Addie Hoffman testify to what Tom Hayden meant while Hayden was sitting right there as a co-defendant would have been suspect.  There likely would have been an objection from prosecution that this was speculation on the part of Hoffman (i.e. how could Hoffman know what Hayden meant?).  Hoffman could have explained that Hayden subsequently told him this (which is allowable hearsay as Hayden and Hoffman are co-conspirators in the alleged crime).  But still... if Hayden is right there, why not have Hayden be the one to testify as to what he meant?  The jury would likely have inferred that the Defense was hiding something by raising this point but not having Hayden himself testify. yeah I thought they were going to re-iterate that on the stand, but i guess that would have been redundant writing? I was thinking, when are they going to tell jurors that revelation?

Also, how the hell do these movies come out so well-timed? Sorkin had to of started writing this well before the events of this year, and then producing and releasing it. How long ago was this written? I just feel like its amazing the synchronicity with real events Oh ok then If I was Aaron Sorkin I would have added that scene just to better portrait who Hoffman was. But it'd probably cost a lot to shoot it. I know! All the comments from people like “They just had to shoehorn in all of the current events and issues from this year, why couldn’t Sorkin just tell the story!!??”....  and I’m thinking, well this screenplay was written more than seven years ago, and the making fo the movie and production had to be last year, how did they shoehorn the current world mess into it??? 

They didn’t know and Sorkin didn’t know what the last six months would be like. But also, they DID know, and it’s the brilliance of the script by Sorkin.  it’s reality NOW and the rest of us just got a front row seat to the reality this movie portrays.  We were supposed to know and see that not much has changed in 50 years when watching, they just didn’t know that the world would explode right before the movie dropped. 

If Rubin and Hoffman were still alive they would probably be protesting with us! 

Makes it that much more brilliant. It is weird. Glad I'm not the only one who noticed. At first i thought he's doing some kind of New York accent but then i just kept hearing Sacha's natural accent mixed in with General Aladeen from The Dictator? Great performance overall but that accent was all over the place. Sounded like Australian at times to me. A younger Michael Imperioli would have looked just liked Hoffman. I heard once that sometimes people just sound a bit too atypical or high-pitched, etc.  And if an actor copies them exactly, it would stand out too much and the audience wouldn't buy it.  If SBC came in sounding like that, it definitely would've stood out too much. Wow, that's such a different character than what Cohen portrayed. The complete lack of hesitation. He knew what the answer was before  the guy asked, whereas in the movie it was a thing Hoffman had to mull over. They could have surely just had literally any other character do the punching, if they needed a scene where someone gets punched in court lmao.. The weedy dude who got hit over the head and was the 'cause' of the riot, for example. Didn't look like he could hurt a fly, so that'd work well enough for the intention of showing anyone could be pushed to violence. 

Such an odd choice. I'd like to know what Sorkins justification was. He was probably jealous he got out dialogued. Lately, I’ve seen that problem in many true stories told in media. In general, the bad guys have to be toned down in order to make the story believable. The story that actually happened. It amazes and saddens me very much. I agree, but I think John Carroll Lynch got as much as he could out of what he was given I loved Keaton here; all the acting was great.  I don’t actually have any negatives... 10/10 for me.  It is very rare that I get excited about a movie and find it flawless... but here we are. ! This might make you (slightly) happy then. First, society is changed, and the majority would now agree with the defendants.

Secondly, a majority of professionals hated the man and even the state mostly benched him in the end. From Wiki:

*In 1974, author Joseph Goulden wrote a book called The Benchwarmers, which was an exposé of the powerful and often private world of federal judges. Goulden conducted an in-depth investigation of Judge Hoffman and pointed out that he had an abrasive reputation among Chicago lawyers even before his most famous case. Goulden mentioned a survey that had been done among Chicago attorneys who had recently appeared before the judge and 78% had an unfavorable opinion of him. They responded overwhelmingly negatively to the questions, ""Does he display an impartial attitude?"" and ""Is he courteous to both the prosecution and defense?""*

*In 1982, the Executive Committee of the United States District Court ordered that Hoffman not be assigned any new cases because of his age and complaints that he was acting erratically and abusively from the bench. However, he continued to preside over his ongoing cases until his death from natural causes the next year, a week before his 88th birthday*

Further:

""*The Seventh Circuit reversed all of the convictions in 1972, ruling that the judge’s “deprecatory and often antagonistic attitude toward the defense is evident in the record from the very beginning. It appears in remarks and actions both in the presence and absence of the jury.”""*

And us being who we are... What memory of this man will be imprinted in our collective knowledge, if any? The movie version, it's the movie version. He was a power hungry, ridculously biased shit-heel on the wrong side of history, and if remembered at all, he will be remembered as such. 

And that, in the end, is justice. Oh shit that's where I know her from! I don't understand why they made the prosecutor so sympathetic to the audience and the 7? > Plus audiences typically know JGL as the good guy, which I think helps pull off this tug of allegiances.

This is actually why I didn't really like him as a choice for this role. From the get go I knew he was going to play the role of a ""bad guy but not really bad guy"" which made the character's actions quite predictable. No that was just to show an exasperated old man like “no! You....you sit down!” They toned everybody down! Even Bobby Seale got toned down. Most of the film he's on the defensive, in reality I think he was much more forthright. I really hoped that more of Abbie's statements had made in it. My personal favourites are the following:   


ONE

 **MR. HOFFMAN:** The judges in Nazi Germany ordered sterilization. Why don't you do that, Judge Hoffman?   


TWO

**MR. HOFFMAN:**   Your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room. Vo den? Shanda fur de goyem? Huh.   


THREE

**THE COURT:** I decide each motion on its own papers, sir, and I am not aware of any witnesses that the Government has sought to bring here. I don't know whether --

**MR. HOFFMAN:** We are very confused about this. Is the Government going to present our defense as well as our prosecution?

**THE COURT:** Have you gotten that -- what is the name of that defendant speaking?

**MR. HOFFMAN:** Just Abbie. I don't have a last name, Judge. I lost it. We can't respect the law when it's tyranny.

**THE COURT:** Are you able to hear the defendant Hoffman speaking?

**MR. HOFFMAN:** Abbie.

&#x200B;

 FOUR

**THE COURT:** Let the record show that Mr. Hoffman stood up, lifted his shirt up, and bared his body in the presence of the jury - -

**MR. KUNSTLER:** Your Honor, that is Mr. Hoffman's way.

**THE COURT:** \- - dancing around.

(There was laughter in the courtroom.)

**MR. KUNSTLER:** Your Honor, that is Mr. Hoffman's way.

**THE COURT:** It is a bad way in a courtroom.""

\* \* \*

""**Q** Mr. Phillips, my question before we had the little colloquy had to do with - -

**THE COURT:** It was not a little colloquy, that was taking Mr. Hoffman to task for improper conduct in the courtroom.

**BY MR. KUNSTLER:**

**Q** Before Mr. Hoffman was taken to task for improper conduct in the courtroom, I asked you whether he was in hippie dress.

**MR. HOFFMAN:** That would make it hippie dress, naked. They *really* made Rubin a lot more fun than he was. I fully support the ideals of the movie and what Rubin claimed to stand for but he just behaved like an ass most of the time and just liking the camera like Haden accuses Hoffman of in the movie. There's an interview Jerry did with Donahue on YouTube and he just wastes most of his time making jokes. Dude was very much into himself and his own legend. [deleted] Watched Barbarians just this week.  I spent this whole movie wondering where Rylance has been all my life. Sorry, I'm late, but I need to vent somewhere.

I agree with your post, but I do so relcutantly. I can forgive most changes for movie/ drama sake. The cheesy ending is fine to me. It's all mostly fine, the message remains mostly the same. Creative liberty and all that.

But the one thing I HATED, truly, truly hated was the scene in which Dellinger hit a Bailiff. The man never did that. He was as much a steadfast pacifist as he claimed to be. Why was this complete fabrication necessary? For additional drama? Wasn't there enough drama? Did we really need a regretful shot of his son for this movie to work? It lessens the memory of a man that was just what he said a was, and that happens to be something we should all aspire to be.

When a student, he *did* hit a man. Which *led* to him becoming a pacifist. This is what he said at a later time about that event: 

*''I shall never forget the horror I felt the instant my fist struck solid flesh. When my victim fell, I dropped to my knees, lifted his head and I cradled him until he came to. I walked him home. I never saw my enemy again.''*

That man lived his live as a pacifist from then on. He never broke. FFS he stayed active his entire life. He joined protests at the *very next* Chicago Democratic Convention in 1996 and was promptly arrested *again* for taking part in a sit-in. That man is a legend and an inspiration!

Read up on the guy, he has his flaws but he lived an *exceptional* life!!! And for that reason that single scene just pisses me off to no end. It stains that mans memory all while being wholly unnecessary.

Thanks for listening. I fully agree with you but I can't believe he missed the opportunity to mention the fact Mailer Leary or Ginsberg where in the court, I just read that and that seems kinda relevant. That's why I loved it.  Personally, I don't need every show I watch to beat me down with darkness,irony and cynicism.  I love Breaking Bad, the Wire, and Boardwalk Empire, but sometimes I need a palate cleanser.  Sorkin provides that. He was giving Bobby that choice, he made the argument above at the outset but ultimately if Bobby decides he wants representation at some point during the trial then he would have given him it To be fair to the prosector, he was just doing his job and he DID go after cops who beat protesters as well. First time in my life where an intense watch wasn't improved or mellowed even slightly by smoking a joint. Probably did make me cry more though. Sucks for Sly that Rocky came out in 1976. He would have almost definitely won for Best Original Screenplay most years.

Instead he was up against one of the best (IMO *the* best) screenplays of all time: Network. This is the problem with lifetime judicial appointments. The only way they could've forced him out was if Congress impeached him, and while judges have been successfully impeached and removed in the past, it's always been for things like bribery and tax evasion. There's just no other mechanism for dealing with someone who's as flagrantly unfit as this guy was. Hoffman (the judge) took Senior status in 1972 (at age 76). Judges who take senior status open a seat up for an appointment while still retaining a full salary and a reduced caseload. The chief judge in a circuit is able to assign the senior judge to perform any duty in the circuit that the senior judge is willing/able to perform.

Sandra Day O’Connor did a form of this after retiring from the Supreme Court in 2005. She would fill in whenever vacancies left openings in federal appellate courts in order to have the minimum number of judges for a panel. I read the Supreme Court case Buck v Bell for class where the fucking Supreme Court allowed forced sterilization by the state on the ""mentally unfit."" Its worse when you read about the history of the woman that was sterilized and all the fucked up trauma she had. To this day it has not been overturned Incredible. Calling the court obscene was just brilliant.


Thanks for taking the time to copy/paste this part. While I was watching the movie I kept saying that I needed to get my hands on the transcripts to see the real story! The thing is, I don’t think it was done tastefully. Felt incredibly artificial and shoehorned in to appease the crowd pleaser demographic. It’s meant to capture the Green Book audience. >No one watching doesn't get the point

I'm going to respectfully disagree. There is a whole swath of middle-America out there right now who would fail to see the parallels between that moment and ours. I loved this movie, but that ending feels cheap and unless you're already bought into the parallel, you'll just walk away thinking ""of course, justice won!"" and then continue hem-hawing about BLM protestors.

An example of a completely opposite approach would be the ending of *BlacKkKlansman,* in which I think Spike Lee understood that moderate Americans' blindness to their own role in history could only be met with an incredibly abrasive illustration to the contrary.

The wish-fulfillment ending like this is classic Sorkin. I'm not too surprised that he put it in there, and you're right, it's nice to see. Personally I would have just preferred something a little more realistic. Boyle and Fincher. Unfortunately, this story never stopped being relevant since it happened. I thought it was pretty straight forward trying to do a thick Boston accent Huh?  Abbie Hoffman's actual accent wasn't strange.  What Sascha Barron Cohen did was legit weird sounding. I can only assume it’s for a narrative arc of that character. Otherwise he remains the same throughout, which may be accurate but I guess feels flawed from a writing perspective. >i'd like to know what Sorkins justification was. 

He's a liberal who can't handle the idea that there might be people further left/more principled than him.

He can't imagine how it's impossible for a good person to be anti-american or anti-american army because he's an idiot who's been drinking the koolaid for years Probably to show even if you’re on the “other side”, you don’t have to stand with them entirely on everything. Also to probably avoid him being cartoonishly a “bad guy”, even if that’s what was true. Now you're into a different conversation. I didn't *love* the movie, and this type of thing is a reason why. To me, it was feel-good to the point of being powerless. ""There are 8 really good guys here to save the day! Hell, even one of the bad guys is actually a good guy!"" As in The West Wing (specifically John Goodman as the republican Speaker of the House), Sorkin always tries to write the other side extremely charitably. Reddit used to love that about his work, now it's what they hate about his work. This is a good point. JGL never plays a villain (except in 500 Days of Summer, ba-dum tshh) so the audience views him as more sympathetic from the start. The Dollop (podcast) does an amazing job covering Abbie Hoffman before, leading up to, and during the trial. It is much clearer from the podcast how much of what happened he either planned or knew would go down. The main guy who makes the Dollop is definitely very biased though and hates Sorkin's portrayal (though he doesn't attempt to shy away from this at all). He basically is annoyed that Sorkin, as a Democrat, attempts to co-opt a leftist hero for the cause when in reality Democrats were against Hoffman and the seven in general.

From what else came out of the podcast, I think they were most insulted by ""Schultz"" (the prosecutor) being sympathetic and someone the audience can connect with. Personally though, while I am very far from an expert, I think the movie captured the tone of most of the events well, even if details were made up here or there (or all over). I do appreciate Abbie a whole lot more after the podcast though, he was a true genius. Did you not watch the movie? The scene is that Mark Rylance receives an audio recording of Redmayne shouting a line into the mic at the protestors that the court will perceive as a direct command to attack (because it basically is). That’s the literal scene, and Rylance tells Redmayne this is why Redmayne cannot take the stand.

It is revealed Redmayne misspoke due to grammar vagueness (Cohen literally gives a little monologue about it), and didn’t mean for his line at the protest to come out the way it did. The misspoken line directs the protestors to march on, where they meet the cops, which leads them to find the unblocked bridge, which then leads them to getting beat up at the restaurant.

The whole entire protest march happens because, as Cohen literally monologues, Redmayne has this one hiccup with his grammar where he meant to say “our blood” but didn’t due to said hiccup that is also prevalent throughout his other writings. [Ginsberg's transcript](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Chicago7/Ginsberg.html) is fucking hilarious. When the judge got too worked up Ginsberg started going ""Oooommmmm"" to try and calm him down. Newsroom was liberal porn, even more than West Wing. I fucking love The Newsroom. It’s one of my favorite shows of the last decade. But I can see how someone might think it’s message is a bit much It’s this sense of infallibility that upsets me most about the judicial system. The system is far from impartial and fair. Shouldn't they have some sort of periodic psych/medical evaluation for judges? As depicted in the movie at least, this guy was clearly dealing with some sort of cognitive issues, perhaps dementia or simply senility. Shouldn't someone be able to step in and say, ""Hey, we need to test this person's cognitive abilities""? It's terrifying that someone who can't even remember from one moment to the next who is representing whom would be allowed to influence decisions and render any sort of sentencing that could effectively end someone's life. If you ask your local library you might be able to get a copy of the transcript. The whole thing is worth a read. There are some parts available online, like [here](https://famous-trials.com/chicago8/1335-chi7-trial). You'll note the defence witness were incredible: Alan Ginsburg, Judy Collins, Timothy Leary, Arlo Guthrie, etc. It's straight from /r/thathappened.

To have the judge lose control in this way is weird because for the whole movie the judge has been a tyrannical power that shows you how parts of the justice system are broken and how some people have power over you while not listening to reason and you have no power to stop them.

To have the main characters overcome that by winning the crowd does a disservice to the reality that there are systems of power that are unfair against minorities and fringe groups.

You can end it by having them found guilty, sentences and then show text where they appeal and win because of course, in the end, the land of the free and the home of the brave won't stand up to this kind of gross injustice. Middle America not seeing the point isn't going to change because of the ending. Middle America isn't watching this movie anyways. 

I didn't even think about the ending until people were shitting on it on Reddit. Yeah I thought that was pretty clear with the way he was really hitting the 'ahs'. But otherwise he was doing a generic American accent most of the time probably because he wasn't confident or sure how to do Bostonian on other sounds. As someone who had never heard the real Abbie’s voice before the movie, I totally bought into SBC’s portrayal, but idk maybe that was just me Yeah, they even had to tone down the judge probably for the same reason. Nobody would believe a real person could be that awful. So fucking funny, I can’t believe how stupid the conversation is. It's also annoying that Sorkin made these people some kind of ""Respect the troops"" losers while the judge was trying to shut them up for respecting the troops too hard?

They were reading out American and Vietcong names, Sorkin left out the Vietnamese names because he doesn't understand politics. Yeah it was a bit uneven and I could even hear a bit of his British accent coming through. Great performance, otherwise. I can't believe the prosecution's entire angle with Ginsberg was ""ur gay!"" Like Foran's line of questioning is just asking suggestive questions about whether Ginsberg has an ""intimate"" friendship with the defendants and then making him read out one of his gay erotica poems.

What I wouldn't give to have been in the courtroom when Ginsberg read the line about the ""cock in the darkness"" in front of that particular judge. ",1
118,"Sorry for the late discussion thread, /u/mi-16evil went into the shimmer 2 days ago and he mutated into an Ivysaur. RIP.

[Here's a link to the previous pseudo-official discussion thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7zpv3a/psuedoofficial_discussion_annihilation_spoilers/)

EDIT: Discussion is temporarily stickied again for the Netflix release. That fucking bear with a woman's scream. Nightmares I don't know if my comment posted but I was intrigued that the house the team stayed in within the Shimmer looked just like Portman's house. Also when Portman drinks water at the end two water circles are created out of the sip which is very interesting imagery.  I went into my second viewing having absorbed the consensus theory online about how this was all about the characters' various forms of ""self-destruction"", but I came away this time with a pretty strong sense of what it was really about on a higher level. I think the self-destruction angle is definitely a theme, but it can't be everything because a) it's too on-the-nose since that concept was explicitly discussed in at least two different conversations between characters and this is definitely a movie that wants to be smarter than that, and b) it's a really sad and bleak message, and I actually think this is ultimately a hopeful, if somewhat solemn, movie. I'm curious to see what people think about my interpretation.

What I think this movie is about is: Personal change. It's like Lena says at the end-- the Shimmer wasn't destroying, it was changing, making ""something new"". I started thinking about this concept during my second viewing when I realized just how strongly the film seems to revolve around her relationship with Kane. It starts out with ""him"" returning to her, and it ends with the two of them together, with all those intervening flashbacks. Obviously this movie ultimately wants to be *about them* and perhaps say something about the nature of relationships. 

Before Kane goes into the Shimmer, their marriage is damaged-- she's having an affair and he knows about it. We see that they have a legitimate spark, but we know that something is broken. We see him distant, struggling with what to do. So he goes off on his quest of ""self-destruction"". But I think the Shimmer actually represents something more- a place people find themselves at times in their lives, a sort of mental purgatory where some kind of facing of fears and personal change is required in order to move on. Some kind of ""self-destruction"" might be a necessary part of that process, if one needs to shed parts of themselves that hold back progress. It also requires facing your anger and deepest anxieties. And like Josie says, some people when they encounter a stage of personal transformation, will be eager to face it, some will fight it, and some might just peacefully accept. 

So here's how I see the events of the movie from a totally metaphorical standpoint:
Kane goes off on his journey. He's so hurt, sad, and damaged that when he faces the possibility of drastically changing who he is, he yields to this impulse and allows the doppelganger to return in his place. He comes back to Lena but he's not the same man, and his new self is unstable, and too alien for her to accept. His transformation has threatened to be their final separation. Lena feels responsibility for what has happened, and is now given a choice, and posed to her by Ventress at the base: she could retreat and ""go home"", abandoning Kane and their relationship. But she has given up her affair and resolved that she ""want[s] to be with him"", which will require her own journey of self-appraisal, facing down of fears, and transformation. So she sets out on her personal struggle as well, to face her lies, anxieties, and yearnings. When her turn comes to face the new person that threatens to take over her identity, she cannot accept it as readily, and mostly preserves her current self. But having resolved her internal struggle and committed to enough of this journey of transformation, she returns to Kane and accepts him in his current state. They embrace, having a shared experience and newfound understanding. It doesn't matter who either of them once were or is now-- they have accepted and forgiven the past and will move forward together. 
 
People face all kinds of internal struggles and crises, and usually don't stay the way they were when we first met them. Staying committed to a relationship, or any endeavor in life, takes hard work, and asks that people take a hard look at themselves, decide which parts they can live with, and allow themselves to grow and change with each other. When times of struggle and transformation come, it's up to each individual how much to resist and struggle against change, and how much to accept it. Sometimes we don't have that much control over it. But at the end of the day, only through waging our own lonely internal battles can we understand and accept others as flawed and dynamic fellow human beings, and learn to move forward together, whether in a romantic relationship or otherwise.

I think ""annihilation"" here refers to the annihilation of the broken past, or parts of the self, that is sometimes needed to move on constructively.

Whew, I hope this makes some sense to people and I'm not just a crazy rambler. My jaw was on the floor during the whole bear scene. Absolutely dreadful yet amazing at the same time Anyone else obsessed with that one theme that played towards the end? It was hauntingly mesmerizing and cosmic sounding.  An interesting allusion I saw during the movie was immediately after they killed the freaky skeleton bear thing.

The physicist, reflecting on what just happened, talks about how ""it must be horrible to die scared and in pain and only having your screams of fear live on as the only remnant of you"" or something to that effect referring to how the voice of the woman who got dragged off by the bear still lived on in that bear. 

Later on, we see a scene where Lena is reading ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" next to Kane in a flashback. The book details the story of Henrietta Lacks, a woman who died from cancer in the middle 20th century but who had her cervical cancer cells taken during her treatment by a physician (without Lacks' consent or knowledge) for research purposes. Those cancer cells from Lacks live on today as the HeLa immortal cell line and have been used (and continue to be used) extensively as a study model for many important biological innovations (e.g. Salk tested his polio vaccine on these cells).

It seems like Garland is pointing to Lacks as a real life example of what happened to the woman who got killed by the bear; it would be terrible for you and your family to know that the only part of you physically living on is the mutated cancer cells that ultimately killed you. No matter how much good has and will be done with these cells, these cells that were once you and that ultimately unmade you will be the only vestiges that define your legacy. This movie has to win some type of award for set design or art direction. Natalie Portman is stellar in this movie.  During he scene where her husband returns, her facial expressions go from 0-60 in 3 seconds flat and it is amazing. The ending reminded me of that movie Under The Skin...like a lot. Anyone agree? Okay when her copy/alien thing got into a crouch position and that weird trailer sound played , I literally got goosebumps it was so beautiful  My dad was furious that they left the tower to go to some tiny tiny stand for 'guard duty' vs staying up top. Like he was furious.  If I remember correctly, was the house they entered in the shimmer (where the bear attacks) the same as her house outside the shimmer? The stairs and rooms looked identical. Was that on purpose? The bear skeleton with a human voice is the creepiest fucking thing I've seen and *heard* in years. Holy shit. Me during the first act: This is OK.  Acting is weirdly wooden, and some of this dialogue is really hammy.  Also this reminds me a bit too much of Arrival. 

Me during the second act: Alright, I'm enjoying this more now.  Also it's become a combo of Aliens and The Thing, so that's cool.  Refracting movie DNA. 

Me during the final act: DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN. 


Five stars.  Would've liked a little more time spent on Tessa Thompson's character. Her last scene was such a punch to the gut.  I can understand why the director was upset about this movie not being seen in theaters overseas. This film is absolutely meant to be seen on the big screen. The first shot of Lena cheating is a few second clip of her riding her colleague. When the movie cuts back to her, that's the moment she enters the shimmer.

At the military base, there is a cut back to Lena and Kane's home where Kane is leaving early. He brings her orange juice and sets it by the bedside table. This scene ends with Kane saying, ""I do love you Lena."" The cut back is of a cell dividing into two that Lena is looking at through a microscope. 

In the house in the shimmer where the team stays, which looks like Lena and Kane's home, Lena is looking at her own cells divide. Then a scene change to where Lena, having fucked her colleague, says that has to stop and she'll never do it again. The cut back to the house is ""You lying bitch!"" as Anya slams Lena's head with the butt of a rifle. There is a cut for a couple of seconds back to Kane and Lena's empty bed with the orange juice on the bedside on the table (so this is a reference to Kane's departure scene.) The cut back to the house has Ventress, Lena, and Josie tied up.

The final cut from the shimmer to Kane and Lena is immediately after we see ""The Lighthouse"" title screen. Kane and Lena are on the couch reading. They say ""Hey"" to each other. The body language, the way they say something as simple as ""Hey"" to each other - it's clear they're in love. They have something special. Cut back to the shimmer and Lena is doubled over crying.

There's been a few scattered comments that the affair wasn't needed to tell the story. The affair and the destruction it created? That is the story. Everything else in the movie is an exploration of that.

At its heart, Annihilation is a love story - though a tragic one. It's about love lost. Lena damages her own marriage (Ventress explicitly states how happy people do things like that, to make sure the audience gets the point) and then takes a journey to try and save it. It can't be saved though. The Kane she loved is gone.  

It has been really enjoyable reading redditors' interpretations of this film. Metaphysics, Jungian, fractals, self-destruction, depression, and more. These are amazing to read and give much to think about. Alex Garland - the director and screenwriter - was a literature writer before making movies. Like many writers, he's probably extremely well-read. The number of different influences people spot in this film are unlikely accidental. I'm going to guess Garland really, really knows his shit. This is a monumental work and, in my view, one of the most intelligent and greatest films ever created.

You know how sometimes you're talking about a great movie from decades past and think, ""It must have been insane to haves seen that in the theaters when it first came out. I wonder what that must have been like."" I suspect that 20-30 years from now, film fans will be saying that about Annihilation. If you've ever suffered personal pain so intense that you've entered a period of self-destruction, you've entered the shimmer.

* Time gets distorted. If you've been in a dark place of depression or self-destruction, it's easy to lose days, weeks, or months.

* Communication to the outside world is cut off. If you've been in a hole, you know it's tough for others to reach you and you to reach out.

* Reality gets distorted. Events of the past and who you are get reflected in a way that is a mutation of reality. This could lead to seeing things horrifically but also can lead to seeing creative, beautiful things too - as Lena noted. (And why many artists have periods of self-destruction.) 

* There's a chance monsters (aka ""personal demons"") will tear you apart.

* Some who enter the shimmer don't want answers and they don't want out. The fight is gone. They just want to fade out and disappear, like the physicist who gently becomes part of the landscape. This is a moving portrayal of depression and would guess this part hits some people very, very hard.

For those in the shimmer fighting to find the truth - or ""the light"" - many will die before they get there. (The soldier's bones outside the lighthouse)

Kane does reach the lighthouse but he can't defeat the alien. Sometimes in life one reaches a situation so painful that one does not have the ability to handle it - something like a mental breakdown. At that point in life, who somebody is - their identity - incapable of handling the present situation has no choice but to blow themselves up. The Kane that survives the shimmer is a clone, he's not the Kane that went in. This could be seen as a metaphor for those who when entering a period of self-destruction get hammered and destroyed. They make it out, but the person who makes it out is not the same person who entered.

Lena reaches the lighthouse and the alien, her enemy, the one that blocks the door from her escaping, the one that mirrors and mimics her, she sees as herself. 

This is perhaps an inspirational message to those dealing with self-destructive issues. It's you who is blocking you and the only way you make it out of the shimmer is to blow that shit up.

Once she does that, the shimmer vanishes and Kane recovers. This may be a metaphor for somebody who successfully is able to defeat  their self-destructive tendencies. Things return to normal and those around them heal, even if nobody is quite the same as before they entered.

And for the shimmer appearing in their eyes. If you have been through a period of self-destruction, you can often see it in the eyes of others who have been there too. This may sound silly to some but those experiences really do change one's character. One can often pick out others who have been down a similar path. A take-away I got from this film is that there are so many more dimensions to gore than gallons of blood. The bear and the pool wall have been discussed heavily already, but I was most disturbed by [the quick shot of Gina Rodriguez's tongue lolling out of her torn face after she was mauled.](#spoiler) The shimmer mimics and refracts what was there originally as well as what and who enters it. Every person that entered the shimmer was chosen or volunteered because really they had nothing to live for. Ventress says that people don't commit suicide, they self-destruct. So she sends purely self-destructive people into the shimmer which is I assume why the shimmer was growing. The shimmer didn't have a want or desire, it changed based on what went into it. The people going into the shimmer were destructive so the shimmer was destructive. Lena was the first to break that cycle because she had something to go back for. Her mirrored shimmer self didn't have a want, which is why she could destroy it without it fighting back. Kane didn't have a want to go back so he self-destructed and sent the new innocent shimmer version of himself back to Lena, the shimmer version doesn't know their past. While the real Lena does and will have to live with her decisions. The shimmer will continue to mimic and change and create based on what it encounters. The way I see it is that there is potential for it to create new good in the world if thats what its shown, but throughout the movie it is only shown bad. I see the ending as hopeful, that there is a chance of positive change, or just a lot more bad. Is it just me or did Kane (the real one) have a weird southern accent on the lighthouse tape?   That motherfucking wall in the pool, guys...

I've never seen body-horror *so* disturbing yet *so* beautiful.

I felt an insane amount of dread and uneasy but absolutely could not peel away from it.

To make matters worse/better, the projector in my screening fucked up shortly after that scene so when they got the projector up and running, they started back just as they were walking into the beginning of the pool scene, so I got to marvel at it twice! I really, really enjoyed Annihilation. Despite leaving out significant themes from the book, the movie told a complete, hallucinogenic, and engrossing story. The film left things out in a way that wasn't annoying or manipulative. 

I really loved the feeling, tone, and pace of the whole production. The soundrack/score were wonderful. And, of course, the Rob Hardy's cinematography/imagery were brilliant. Manbearpig was terrifying. The Crawler’s description in the book was so vague that Alex Garland was like “nah, I’m not putting that in the movie.” In one of the flashback scene's Lena is reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks which is about how a line of mutant cancer cells taken from the titular Henrietta Lacks, become immortal, spread across the globe, and raises the question of whether or not she's technically still alive in a way, even if she's just millions of tons of immortal cancer cells. 

Which I thought couldn't have been more thematically appropriate. Did both Lena and Anya have the 8 tattoo the whole time or did it move to Lena after the ""screaming bear scene."" I was trying to find it on Lena in the shimmer after they showed it in her debriefing scene but they never had a good angle of her arm until after Anya was killed.

I feel like it moved from Anya to Lena and if thats the case think it's a really awesome subtle effect of what's happening.  **How The Area X Border Works - A Primer**

*SPOILERS FOR BOTH THE BOOKS AND FILM BELOW*

&nbsp;

I've noticed a lot of posts in this thread asking questions along the lines of:

&nbsp;

- Why not enter Area X by sea?
- Why not use aircraft?
- Why not use vehicles instead of walking? 
- Why not go in a few hundred yards past the border and then immediately come back out?

&nbsp;

These types of questions are all addressed in the books (which are excellent by the way... anyone who enjoyed the film should buy them). Given that Jeff Vandermeer gave Alex Garland input on the script, and that filming began two years after the trilogy was completed, I can only assume that a lot of this information was left out of the film for the sake of simplicity and/or keeping the runtime shorter. This is a shame though, because I think that an additional 30 seconds of exposition to flesh out the nature of the border/shimmer 
(perhaps during the scene when Lena first meets the other team members) might've helped some viewers enjoy the film more.  

&nbsp;

The film doesn't state it explicitly (although I suppose it's implied by the Southern Reach base location), but the only way into Area X is through a small entrance twenty feet high and twelve feet wide. As for the border's other characteristics, according to the books:



>[The border] had a door or passageway through it into Area X...



>[The border] did not allow half measures: Once you touched it, it pulled you in (or across?). It had discrete boundaries, including to about one mile out to sea. The military had put up floating berms and patrolled the area ceaselessly...



>The border extended about seventy miles inland from the lighthouse and approximately forty miles east and forty miles west along the coast. It ended just below the stratosphere and, underground, just above the asthenosphere... You could not get under the border by any means on the seaward side. You could not tunnel under it on the landward side. You could not penetrate it with advanced instrumentation or radar or sonar. From satellites peering down from above, you would see only wilderness in apparent real time, nothing out of the ordinary. Even though this was an optical lie.

&nbsp;

So, what happens if a person or aircraft or ship comes in contact with the border at some point other than its tiny entrance? Basically he/she/it vanishes/is obliterated:



>The night the border had come down, it had taken ships and planes and trucks with it, anything that happened to be on or approaching that imaginary but too-real line at the moment of its creation... The plaintive groan of metal and the vibration of engines that continued running as they disappeared into something, somewhere. A smoldering, apocalyptic vision, the con towers of a destroyer “sliding into nothing” as one observer put it… Some [of the sailors], though, just stood there, watching as their ship disintegrated, and then they crossed over or died or went somewhere else…

&nbsp;

As for why expeditions have to go in on foot rather than using Jeeps or ATVs: crossing through the entrance into Area X is far more treacherous and stressful than it appears from the outside. This is why the expedition members need to be hypnotized beforehand (the film gives a nod toward this when the characters suddenly ""wake up"" in Area X with no recollection of anything beyond approaching the border). It takes hours to traverse, and even though the entrance is twenty feet high and twelve feet wide, it becomes extremely narrow at certain points, making it impossible to get any sort of vehicles though:



>Even though it’s such a tall corridor and so wide, you have to crawl with your pack as close to the middle as possible. As far away from the sides as possible.” [said the scientist] Cheney... Like cats with duct tape on their backs, slinking forward on their bellies. “No matter how you feel about enclosed or open spaces, it’ll be strange in there, because you will feel simultaneously as if you are progressing across a wide open field and as if you’re on a narrow precipice without guardrails and could fall off at any moment. So you exist in a confined and limitless space all.



>Nor did the length of the passageway correspond to the width of the invisible border. Some reports indicated that the passageway meandered, while others described it as straight. The point was, it varied and the time to travel through it into Area X could not be estimated except within a rough parameter of a “norm” of three hours to ten hours.

&nbsp;

So it isn't quite as simple as stepping into Area X and then stepping back out again. And this assumes that the expedition members can even *find* their way out, as once inside Area X there is no longer a border. In the book the biologist comes across a written journal from a previous expedition that had traveled up the coastline in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the border from inside Area X:



>Instead, the same habitat confronted them day after day. “We’re heading north, I believe,” he wrote, “but even though we cover a good fifteen to twenty miles by nightfall, nothing has changed. It is all the same,” although he also was quite emphatic that he did not mean they were somehow “caught in a strange recurring loop.” Yet he knew that “by all rights, we should have encountered the border by now.”



>The return trip to the lighthouse took four days, not seven, “as if the land had contracted.”

&nbsp; 

In all I found the border to be one of the most fascinating parts of the Southern Reach trilogy. I wish it had gotten a bit more screen time in the film, but then the same could be said for a number of other aspects of the book (the writing on the walls, the Crawler, the hypnotic commands, etc...). That said, I was still blown away by the film and will buy it as soon as it becomes available for home viewing in the US.
 Man that third act was like listening to the philharmonic bass division on psychedelics. Definitely merits some nomination in screen adaption, visuals, or sound editing/mixing.   The mimic of Portman's character scene where she tries escaping the lighthouse was some of most dread I've felt for a character ever. There was something so beautiful, yet morbid about a mirror of yourself becoming the cause of your death. The faceless shimmer monster and the bear were some of the best uses of science fiction horror since The Thing for me. 

Garland may have upped himself just on nailing his ambition alone. After the climax ([the humanoid and destruction of the shimmer]) The sound was so loud that the speakers busted and we saw the last scenes in silence, but everyone was so shook at what happened that we thought that was how it was suppose to be until an employee came in and said they would rewind. MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW: Just my interpretation of the movie after a second viewing.

Just watched the movie a second time. I think I had a strange experience watching the film on both viewings. After my initial viewing, I understood the message of the movie and its themes about ""self destruction"". The idea of ""That which nourishes me also destroys me"". I understood that Lena and Kane both had to go through the destruction of the self to become anew. I didn't quite read what their hug at the end meant (let alone what happened in the lighthouse sequence). All I knew was that Kane was the alien and Lena was still herself. I was able to grasp how the psychologies of all the characters in the movie reflected their outcomes by the end of the film.

On my second viewing, I was absolutely blown away. I think I understand the larger picture Alex Garland was attempting to explain about the nature of our existence, life, and the idea of self destruction. I think there are a few key lines of dialogue that I think elevate the film towards ""the cosmic horror"" sense that is rooted in existentialism and the existence of higher dimensional beings/cosmic entities. These quotes aren't word for word, but just my recollection of it.

1. Lena in her classroom: ""All cells come from a singular organism from this planet, maybe the universe""

2. Lena and Kane in bed. ""God doesn't make mistakes"" - Kane
Lena then talks about the nature of senescence - how we think aging is natural but perhaps aging, death, and decay are actually a mutation on the cellular level that wasn't meant to be. I don't have the quote on this but this is what I read it as.

So from these two lines, I started viewing the film moreso among the lines of Alex Garland actually trying to explain the nature of our existence. Did we all truly derive from a singular organism?  Is the nature of the entity that Lena encounters in the tunnel of the lighthouse always to mutate and envelop the things that surround it? (Both living and nonliving - you can see plantlike structures/vines covered in the paint of the lighthouse, and also with the glass trees outside the lighthouse on the sand).

With the lighthouse sequence, when Lena first watches the video that was stored, we see the ""entity"" (The trippy psychedelic visuals at the bottom of the tunnel) and also ""the clone"" (By clone, I'm referring to the metallic body you see briefly in the cam footage looking through the tunnel, as well as the one Lena has an encounter with. These are both the same thing but different form). When we see Kane about to blow himself up, hes actually looking at someone behind the camera. On the first viewing, I took the dialogue as Kane speaking to the audience and super on the nose, but he is actually talking to the clone. He says:

 ""I thought I was Kane in this life. What was I before? Was I you? Were you me?""

He then asks: ""Have you ever seen a phosphorous grenade go off?"" It's pretty bright. Shield your eyes. If you make it out of here find Lena"" 

The clone(off camera): ""I will"" - Kane blows up and the alien/duplicate of Kane steps in front of the camera. Its clear to me on second viewing that Kane's motivation for going into the shimmer was because he felt like he wasn't enough for Lena. He felt he was the reason Lena was cheating on him. It's clear he still loves her, but he isn't enough for her (That's how I read his acting throughout the movie). When he looks into the entity, I think he has the vision about the nature of our existence and also comes to understanding that if he wants to be good enough for Lena, he has to destroy his old body. The clone in itself isn't malevolent - its just its nature. While we as humans may see the changes the entity is making as bad, its essentially merging all microscopic cells that it encounters. Its why we can hear Shephard's voice in the Skelebear, and why we see different species of flowers merging on the same plant structure. The nature of it being able to merge with other cells and organisms is very important and leads us to...

Lena proceeding to go into the tunnel where she finds Ventress. At that point, her and the singular entity have already merged. I honestly can't remember the exact dialogue but she says something along the lines of:

""We talked. Remember how I told you I wanted to find what's inside the lighthouse? I found it. Its inside me. Inside all of us. We will all be just fragments until we are one... ANNIHILATION"" - again not exactly but its what I can remember.

Lena then has the psychedelic vision, her blood gets enveloped in the entity, and it creates a ""blank canvas""/clone of her anatomical structure. She tries to shoot it, but its impervious to her bullets. It mirrors her, she tries to hit it and it hits back. She tries to run from it, but it prevents her. The clone sees itself and Lena very much as a part of each other, and doesn't want her to run away from it. She needs to go through the destruction of her self if she wants to move on from the guilt of her marriage and become anew (this seems like the primary motivation for Lena to enter the shimmer). 

The clone that formed from the entity views everything as part of itself. It wants to adapt and become better - but to become better you have to destroy your old self. When Lena touches its hand, it begins taking her appearance. She then puts the grenade in its hand. The clone is unaware of what this grenade is. That's why Lena pulls the pin, waits, and and is able to run out at the last second. The clone wasn't harmed by it - but the clone is still the entity. The nature of the entity is to mutate and evolve to its surroundings. Lena has left the lighthouse and the clone has returned to its metallic form. It is set afire in a blue plasma, and is looking for a form of life. It touches Kane's dead body - his body contains the physical form of ash. The clone then touches the vines that are in the lighthouse and they are cast afire. By touching Kane's ash body, the clone absorbed the physical reaction of something being burned to ash. It is set ablaze and dies in ash, and we see the glass trees surrounding the lighthouse light up and disintegrate into ash. Benedict Wong's character then clarifies in the interview room that a team has reached the lighthouse and it is all ash.

What I take from this, is that all life on Earth has derived from a singular organism. Maybe not the one that landed in the movie, but something similar that landed on Earth long ago. It begs the question - was the meteorite sent by some higher cosmic entity? Or is the entity itself just a higher life form/the original life form?

Now I can read the hug at the end between Kane and Lena two different ways.

1. Her hug was more just that she understands the clone is not malevolent. We are all apart of it and it is just trying to be itself.

2. Lena realizes that they are the only people to have entered the shimmer and return. They are both different on a cellular level. They are the evolved version of humanity. Does she realize they should still be together to reproduce and pass on these cellular mutations to another generation? Will them reproducing create a new life form on Earth? The film with this interpretation delves more into the importance of a man and woman in a relationship and that both are needed to reproduce (Like BR2049). 

These definitely aren't the only interpretations from the ending but I love the discourse about it from everyone.

 Can someone PLEASE explain to me why the psychologist/Ventress didnt have eyes for like 8 seconds when they were down in the hole under the lighthouse?  I thought I was on an acid trip at the end the movie. can we talk about how all the skeletons were lined up in that weird way outside the light house This movie was like candy for the eyes. The flowers and mushrooms were so *beautiful,* and the alien fractal was mesmerizing. 

I liked the interaction between the interviewer and Lena when she explains that the alien wasn't malicious, that it didn't want, that it just created. It took what earth had to offer and reflected upon it, falling inevitably into self destruction. Man, what a movie.  Props to everyone involved.  I've rambled about the books elsewhere in this thread, and I don't mean to be that guy, but this movie is much more impressive in light of the books.  Book spoilers ahead (though hopefully nothing that would ruin the experience of reading them).

This is possibly the hardest book adaptation I can think of.  I remember coming away from reading Annihilation, and thinking that I would never see a screen adaptation.  The book is just too hard!  It reads like someone dared Jeff Vandermeer to write a horror novel set in the least threatening environment he can think of.  Not only is it set mostly during the day in a state park in sunny Florida, it seems like every character makes some kind of reference to how beautiful and peaceful the wilderness is.  The biologist is constantly talking about how the light bounces off the leaves, or how there's a clump of wildflowers in the distance, and the sun is shining, etc.

On top of that, the horror is Lovecraftian, which means that Jeff instills fear by describing how it make the characters feel in the first-person.  [Animals are portrayed as normal, but feel vaguely human to the characters - Jeff describes how it makes them feel unsettled.  Walking through the wilderness feels weird, but there's no outward signs of anything wrong.  Interpersonal relationships are warped and strained as time goes on, but the changes to the characters are told via their internal monologues.  Plants are clearly derived from human cells, but the biologist discovers that by looking at them in the microscope.](#spoiler)

There are some moments where the horror is shown, not just thought about from the perspective of one of the characters - there just aren't as many of them as you might expect.  [They see a video where the team members are conversing to each other in gibberish, but look like they understand each other.  Encountering the crawler in the tunnel/tower.](#spoiler)

I can't imagine how I would even begin adapting this.  [The part where the boar charges at them, and it's a totally normal-looking boar but feels disturbingly human - how do you ""show, not tell"" that?  I mean, Jeff writes it very well, but it boils down to ""it's normal but they think it's weird"".](#spoiler)  Then they creatively showed the link between the dead humans and animals by giving the bear the voice of the dead linguist.  Incredible creativity there.  In the book, the border is described as clear, showing the beauty of the consumed state park but being creepy at the same time.  They chose that bubble-wash effect to give an unsettling feeling without sacrificing light or color, which I would never have thought of myself.

The set design & screenwriting was just fantastic.  I can't imagine how I would preserve the tone of a book like that in a visual medium.  Great job to everyone involved. My wife had a really interesting theory that Lena was happy about her husband being the Shimmer Kane because he wouldn't know about her infidelity. It would have been an opportunity to start over. I really hope this movie does well at the box office. Ambitious, creative, thought provoking film. Absolutely beautiful. Not for everyone but I don’t think there are enough movies like this. Did anyone else get “The Last Of Us” video game vibe when they saw the guys body consumed by the mold/fungus? Spoilers, for those who've ventured into this thread without seeing the movie. Currently too drunk and too in-thought about the movie to format them properly.

Was I the only one who felt bad for Kane as a character?

We're shown a history of he and his wife, met in the military, probably had some life-threatening and bonding situations during that time; he finds out she's cheating on him, he silently suffers, then decides that he wants to go on whats essentially a suicide mission because he's just done?

And then we're shown his final moments of life, where he's presumably spoken to not!Kane about his wife, how much he cares for her, and how he wants not!Kane to find her when he gets out, then commits suicide after spending months to a year in a specialized hell.

Like, goddamn. 

Maybe I'm reading too much into it or am being too empathetic, but the tragedy behind that character is really palpable. The score really set this movie over the top for me. That final 15 minutes where the sound and score just overcomes everything was perfectly overwhelming. 

ScreamBear was gnarly and terrifying, the flower people were beautiful. It was so fresh feeling, I can't wait to pick up the books and dive into those. 

 I think Alex Garland can direct a Last of Us adaptation. There were some visual effects that immediately made me recall aspects of the game.  This would be the perfect movie and also the worst movie to watch on shrooms  Uh, can I get the rest of that footage they found on the memory card ASAP as possible?? Saw this last night at a 7 pm screening. Probably about 30 people in the theater. I'd never read the book so I only knew what to expect from the first trailer.

Really, really loved it. The concept of the Shimmer was so interesting to me - the movie had this underlying dread with bursts of grotesque violence and horror but it was so beautiful at the same time. I was hypnotized by it, couldn't look away. Yes, even during the damn video camera ""stomach"" scene.

That was nuts. 

Overall, really loved it. Natalie Portman is the stand-out of the cast with special mention to Tuva Novotny as Cass. Jennifer Jason Leigh I felt was a little bland but her character is supposed to be disconnected from the others.

Also - there was some goofy dialogue at times. Clunky is probably a better description. But I was completely encompassed in this movie. Would love to see more of this world explored but it seems to be a standalone which I'm totally fine with, too. [deleted] I like seeing something I've never seen in horror before.  I'm a big fan of cosmic horror (though HP Lovecraft throwing tentacles and alien symmetry on monsters seems a little quaint by today's standards).  I love seeing characters in unnerving, threatening situations where they're confronted with something so alien, you're not even sure if it's possible to get out alive.

Was it weird?  Oh yeah.  The perfect kind.  It entertains the possibility mankind might one day come up against something truly alien -- an affront to everything we think we know about nature.  The constructs of motivation, empathy, and choice may not apply to it.

""I'm not even sure it was *aware* of me.""  What if you don't find an alien?  What if you find a *process?*

This is a rare gem in horror.  Not a perfect movie, but instant classic for me. I can't believe Tessa Thompson's character literally made like a tree and leaf(ed).  That bear was scury. It’s just dawned on me that everyone that went into the Shimmer was knowingly going on a suicide mission, so everyone had something in common and were essentially damaged goods ... including Kane because he knew Lena was cheating on him. Everyone’s psychology was that of self destruction and the effect of the Shimmer exacerbated that to the point of suicide or madness induced murder.  The alien duplication was its evolutionary solution to this inevitable self destruction... make a copy before it dies.

Lena’s psychology was different ... she didn’t have a death wish and was driven by the opposite.. saving Kane’s life and in the process paying off the emotional debt she was in. Rather than wanting herself to die, or give in like the others ... she had the psychology to survive... there wasn’t a need for a duplicate and the alien seemed to almost accept the challenge to self destruct itself (the casual walking around the lighthouse whilst on fire, torching the walls was telling).

The scene at the end with Kane and Lena was amazing in all this context. Whether one was duplicate Kane and the other real Lena is irrelevant ... cells make perfect copies... the point was that Lena had atoned herself through this badass mission, and Kane has no knowledge of the affair... they can start again and make each other whole.

The Shimmer in their eyes at the end was a bit hokey but I get it...they are changed forever and have that alien dna within them...the story of psychology and redemption, personally, could have been grounded a little better by Garland throughout for an even bigger hard hitting emotional payoff at the end..which Arrival and Villeneuve nailed so well.  Garland had a similar opportunity here in my opinion...and could have turned what I believe is a great movie into a real masterpiece. [deleted] Deeply Jungian movie. The tripartite struggle with the shadow across three different individuals, Kane, Ventress, and Lena, is where the meat of this movie is.

[Kane is replaced by his shadow. Ventress succumbs to her shadow, and Lena integrates her shadow.](#spoiler)

In Jungian psychology, the ""shadow"", ""Id"", or ""shadow aspect/archetype"" may refer to (1) an unconscious aspect of the personality which the conscious ego does **not identify** in itself, or (2) the entirety of the unconscious, i.e., everything of which a person is not **fully conscious**. In short, the shadow is the ""dark side"".

Because one tends to **reject or remain ignorant** of the least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is largely negative. There are, however, positive aspects which may also remain hidden in one's shadow (especially in people with low self-esteem, anxieties, and false beliefs).[1] To know oneself, one must **accept one's dark side.**

Contrary to a Freudian definition of shadow, therefore, the Jungian shadow can include everything outside the light of consciousness and may be positive or negative. ""Everyone carries a shadow,"" Jung wrote, ""and the less it is **embodied** in the individual's **conscious life**, the **blacker** and **denser** it is.""[2] It may be (in part) one's link to more **primitive animal instincts**,[3] which are **superseded** during **early childhood** by the **conscious mind**.

Carl Jung stated the shadow to be the unknown dark side of the personality.[4][5] According to Jung, the shadow, in being instinctive and irrational, is prone to psychological projection, in which a perceived personal inferiority is recognized as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else. Jung writes that if these projections **remain hidden**, ""The projection-making factor (the Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can **realize its object**—if it has one—or bring about some other situation characteristic of its power.""[6] These projections **insulate and harm** individuals by acting as a constantly **thickening veil of illusion** between the ego and the real world.

[I emboldened certain text for emphasis. Kane's (also an allusion to the biblical Cain's) failure in his confrontation with the shadow is his lack of self awareness (also echoed in the bible story). In the movie, this manifests in his occupation as a soldier--purely body, taking orders--and his absence from all scenes involving the side conflict of Lena's affair. He's never depicted as finding out. He seems oblivious. So when his shadow manifests, and he does not see it coming, he loses himself and only his shadow remains. In the link at the bottom, this falls under the section ""Encounter With.""](#spoiler)

[Ventress' failure manifests in the opposite manner. She has no body--she has cancer--yet is fully aware of her own desire for self destruction, as is noted by her conversation with Lena during the Area X section. Her encounter with the shadow leads not to alienation and duplication, as with Lena and Kane, but to merging, to becoming. Ventress projects her desires onto the shadow. She says that she has come to understand that it does not want. It only annihilates. But as we come to see, the shadow simply imitates its subject. So the truth of Ventress' understanding is dubious; she confuses it with herself. She then gets what she wants, in horrifying, spectacular fashion. This falls under the section in the wikipedia link, ""Merger with""](#spoiler)

[Lena wins. She is a combination of both previous attempts, both soldier and thinker. I emboldened the part of text explaining that Jung's shadow is in everyone and the less it is embodied in conscious life, the blacker and denser it becomes. Lena takes his advice and literally dances with her shadow, or to use Jung's word, ""embodies it."" Imitation is the most basic form of learning. Lena starts as a child would, with her body through action and imitation, not rumination like Ventress. Lena's embodied confrontation and struggle with her shadow leads to a breakthrough in her awareness, just as a child's repeated action and imitation leads to higher-order cognition. This breakthrough leads her to formulate her scheme. Jung wrote, ""To know oneself, one must accept one's dark side."" So, Lena allows it to approach and joins hands with it, which is the moment the shadow becomes vulnerable, like her. She takes this opportunity to fully ""illuminate"" it, to reduce its ""blackness and density,"" with a phosphorous grenade. In the wikipedia article, this is in the ""Assimilation of"" section.](#spoiler)

[The true cleansing of the shadow leads to the destruction of that ""constantly thickening veil of illusion between the ego and the real world,"" i.e. the shimmer, since the shadow is the source of that veil, insofar as it remains un-articulated, un-confronted, un-accepted, and un-assimilated.](#spoiler)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)


Edit: It's also worth noting that Jung dedicated an entire book, called The Red Book, to his experiments with psychedelics and the archetypal and religious experiences that they could induce. That this movie took on a cosmetically psychedelic varnish is no coincidence.

Edit 2: The topic of the Ouroboros has come up in places in this discussion thread and it turns out Jung also had his own thoughts on its significance.  It lends to the validity of this movie as inspired by a Jungian archetypal narrative on the encounter with the Shadow:

""The alchemists, who in their own way knew more about the nature of the individuation process than we moderns do, expressed this paradox through the symbol of the Ouroboros, the snake that eats its own tail. The Ouroboros has been said to have a meaning of infinity or wholeness. In the age-old image of the Ouroboros lies the thought of devouring oneself and turning oneself into a circulatory process, for it was clear to the more astute alchemists that the prima materia of the art was man himself. The Ouroboros is a **dramatic symbol** for the **integration** and **assimilation** of the opposite, i.e. of **the shadow**. This 'feed-back' process is at the same time a **symbol of immortality**, since it is said of the Ouroboros that he **slays himself** and **brings himself to life**, **fertilizes** himself and **gives birth** to himself. He symbolizes the One, who **proceeds from the clash of opposites**, and he therefore constitutes the secret of the prima materia which ... unquestionably stems from man's unconscious.""

Edit 3: Just a little extra thought on what exactly the alien is. So, if the movie, essentially, is the journey to an encounter with the shadow, then the alien is ""that which facilitates the encounter with the shadow."" In my first edit I wrote that the psychedelic aesthetic was just a cosmetic varnish, but that's wrong, now, I think. 

Sometimes what happens when people take psychedelics, is they have a ""bad trip."" Through some very interesting recorded experiences, it sounds like these bad trips are unexpected and unwanted encounters with, what's essentially the Jungian shadow, just induced chemically. I remember hearing that--I believe it was south american--shamans used strong doses of psychedelics for initiations, for the express purpose of adventuring out into the mental landscape, encountering ""something"" that, to paraphrase, would strip them down to their bones, and then reconstitute them anew, and equipped them with the ""wisdom of the gods."" ""Annihilation"" is a word that often comes up in these accounts. They would then return to their tribe with the wisdom they'd found on their trip. 

Anyways, it seems reasonable to interpret the alien as some sort of psychedelic, but that induces an actual experience, not a mental one (though users of psychedelics will often argue that their induced experiences are more ""actual"" than normal life). Funny enough, Johns Hopkins, the hospital sharing a name with the university in the movie, did some research on psychedelics and it's viability in curing nicotine addiction, with some outrageous success rate like 80% after six months. Don't quote me on that though.

Ah here it is...
http://time.com/3399433/quit-smoking-psychedelic-drugs-acid-test/ Those screams from that bear will be something I will Never be able to forget! I’m going to take a wild guess here and take this movie very literal. I feel like the shimmer was an airlock / science lab for the aliens. A place that mimicked their own environment to survive, while they tried to find a way to live in earths regular environment. All of the DNA changes and crossovers were experiments to see how to infiltrate their DNA into that of the earths creatures to see what works and what is most effective. 

When Kane (alien) comes home, he bleeds and gets sick, because he has yet to fully adapt to our environment. Water / air makes him sick. When Lena drinks the water, she looks for blood and sees none; the adaption is complete and they no longer needed the shimmer to survive. 

Not sure this is fully sound / perfect, but I like the overall concept. I don't think I've ever seen a scarier monster in any media than that shimmer bear. For a movie that I wouldn't consider within the horror genre, that was one of the most effective horror scenes in years.  Typically when I come out of a movie, my tendency is to immediately analyze the themes or messages expressed in the film. For this movie, I just haven't done that. It's not that I don't think there are interesting themes, and the analysis in this and the other thread about the nature of self-destruction is very intriguing stuff - I just seem to be stuck in the experience of watching. 

It's like, the more I think about it and what it means and how it comes together and how it's all explained, the farther I get from the movie. Just sitting there, enthralled and sweating, as a bear screamed like a human or an alien tried to become one was mesmerizing and thrilling and horrifying and just unique, full-stop. I'm sure I'll think about it more analytically in the future, but for now I just want to linger in that sense of wonder/curiosity/dread. [deleted] The scene with the bear as well as the finale were easily the best parts. 

Don’t think I liked it as much as Ex Machina or Arrival for that matter, but it was still quite the trip. 

Existential horror done right.  How is it a movie that isn’t even listed as horror turned it to be more horrifying than any horror movie put out in the last 5+ years? The Alien scene was out of this world ;-;  One thing I noticed, wondering if anyone else did. Portman in the interview room with the man in the hazmat, she had a tattoo of a infinity symbol made by a snake on her left forearm.  This was the exact tattoo that the other second woman had who got eaten by the bear mutation, sorry I forget her name, the one with the changing hand veins who got her jaw ripped off. That tattoo wasn’t on Portman before right? Could this be the alien creature mimicking things again? Or did I get a detail wrong? [deleted] 'I think the main thematic preoccupation probably belongs primarily to the film, which is really about self-destruction...It’s about the nature of self-destruction in a literal sense...But also psychological forms of self-destruction.' -Alex Garland, director [taken from https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/21/17029500/annihilation-ex-machina-director-alex-garland-sci-fi]

This movie is about our human nature, specifically, our self destructive nature that is 'coded within our DNA' as Dr.V mentions in the movie. 

We started out from a single cell, a singularly, and from there continued to evolve and change. The scientists (and Lena) go through this progression backwards: they walk into a world that is in constant evolution, and as Lena approaches the lighthouse everything begins to become one- the singularity. It’s almost like the history of the universe in reverse- but this singularity envelops humanity’s nature with it. And the nature it envelopes is our self destructive nature. Dr.V mentions that our self destructive nature is a part of our DNA, and we see how this nature manifests in Lena’s life through her history of cheating on her husband. But self-destructive tendencies are also seen in the fellow scientists lives- the physicist was known to use cutting as a way of experiencing feeling, Dr.V has a brash personality that makes it difficult for people to get along with her, etc.

As the scientists start to near the singularity they start to reflect their self destructive nature- threats to kill each other, the physicist (who we know has been having self destructive thoughts about herself) is willing to become plant-like, lose her original form, and therefore destroy her humanity. As they approach the lighthouse everything begins to become one. Lena starts to develop a tattoo that one of the other scientists has, the bear has echos of a human voice, plants can take the form of humans. Like the physicist mentions, their DNA is refracted onto different species. Everything that exists is becoming one thing the closer they get to the singularity. Everything started as one cell and evolved into something else. In the shimmer, everything begins at the evolution stage and becomes the one cell- but this one cell reflects the nature of everything that evolved before it. Most importantly, it reflects the human nature of self destruction: annihilation.

When Lena enters the lighthouse she sees her husband in the video, but this is (in my own interpretation) is actually the singularity that took his likeness and his self destructive nature- his willingness to kill himself shows this nature. The husband that is behind the camera is Kane's real self, but he has been constantly mutating like Lena explains earlier in the movie when she says her cells are constantly changing. When Lena finds Dr.V, Dr.V has given herself up to the singularity. Dr.V says one of the most important and poignant lines in the movie, in paraphrase: 'everything is headed towards annihilation'. Self-destruction is inherent in everything- in everything from human nature to cells. At the beginning of the movie, Lena mentions that she will be giving a lecture on autophagy, which is a mechanism cells use to break down its cellular contents into their basic macromolecular form.  Self-destruction is a part of our biology.

When Lena approaches the singularity, it took some of her blood, allowing it to take some of her likeness. Once it touches her later on it takes her form, including her human nature- self destruction, annihilation. The next part I’d have to watch again, I can’t tell if the singularity was trying to kill itself or have Lena kill herself. Regardless, the singularity lights on fire and again reflects humanity by destroying the lighthouse. Lena escapes but, like her husband, is changed by entering the shimmer. Her dividing cells were completely changing in likeness while she was in the shimmer, and even though she’s out she’s physically a very different person.

This movie has a lot of similarity to Apocalypse Now, where the deeper into the jungle or shimmer they travel, the more we see of humanities true form. In Apocalypse Now it was madness, in Annihilation it is self-destruction.
 Movies like this really get under my skin. I know NOTHING yet I am insanely intrigued and I desperately want to see more!! 

I think I love this movie even though I have no idea what the hell was going on...

Time to read the novels I guess.  Some of you guys in here are trying way too hard to make sense of something that is inherently not supposed to make sense. They are playing at the idea that if alien life exists it would be something beyond our comprehension. Everyone is talking about the ""massive amount"" of plotholes, but when you compare it to something like A Quiet Place (95&#37; on rotten tomatoes) it absolutely pales in comparison. A few of the characters were underdeveloped, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, which made all of their deaths fairly uneventful. However, it was a gorgeous movie and Natalie Portman was fantastic in my opinion. I enjoyed it a lot overall. Movie was far out, don't know if it was as deep as it was trying to be but that fuckin bear monster screaming like a lady was badass. I thought it was a stunning follow-up to *Ex Machina*, though I can see why the studio worried about its appeal.

I thought the cancer references were an interesting motif; the film is full of them. It opens with Lena giving a lecture on cancer cells. She is later seen reading *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*, which is about a woman who died of cancer and produced the first immortal line of human cells. Ventress is said to have cancer. Shepard's daughter died of leukemia. So many shots of cells dividing. I think the Shimmer's effects are a kind of cancer, in a way. It caused all of the normal cellular mechanisms to fall apart and bodies to grow in unregulated ways. That's exactly what a cancer does, too.

In some ways, the Shimmer appears to symbolize the reversal of evolution rather than evolution itself. Evolution has been a 4-billion-year process of differentiation. But inside the Shimmer, the characters and creatures steal different parts of each other and all begin to lose the features that make them unique individuals.

I loved the ambiguity of the ending. Was Lena still herself? How much of her original personality remained intact after the Shimmer? Was the Kane in the hospital facility an alien? Definitely thought-provoking. Can't wait to re-watch it! Seeing a lot of comments on this but I wanted to put up a valid challenge to the claim of 

“Lena being an untrustworthy narrator/Lena is the clone”

While it is true that the story is told entirely in her perspective, if she is the clone, why would she lie and say the real Lena made it out? Why would the clone manipulate the audience? I think it’s very clear that the Alien/clone has no evil intent. The sole purpose and nature of it is to mutate things and make them become reborn in a sense. The Alien wasn’t able to comprehend what the grenade actually was or what it could do. I don’t think it would be able to manipulate the Southern Reach/the audience. 

I also think people are focusing too much on her eye having the same effect as Clone Kane. It’s not so much that because they have the same eye they’re both the clone, it’s that Lena is still a changed person after her journey into the shimmer either way. We’ve already seen her look at her own blood cells and she saw they were already mutating.

 Jesus... That whole end sequence, of Natalie Portman’s character being mimicked by that... replicant alien surrounded by that rotting / thriving scenery left me absolutely breathless.

The whole film was both beautiful and horrifying, and I loved it so much. Just saw the movie and I really liked everything excluding the plot holes, many of which could be fixed by a few lines of exposition in the movie. Yeah yeah, I know the point of the movie wasn't to make perfect sense, but suspension of disbelief only works when it's supposed to be fantastical (DNA mixing and fractals), not when it's something that would have obviously been done by people in that situation or setting.


For example, not using a helicopter to quickly get to the lighthouse. Hahaha, ""Well everyone else we sent in never came back on foot or on boat, let's try more on-foot expeditions!"" As I stated earlier, a quick explanation as to why they couldn't do that would have fixed this issue.

Also, I'm wondering why the military there wouldn't already know about the mutations occurring. If they wanted, stick a few mice in cages tied to ropes right at the edge of the shimmer and allowing to it envelope them before pulling them out at different intervals would have quickly made clear to scientists there that something weird was going on with the mice cells. This could have been fixed by simply allowing the military to know at least this problem with the shimmer.

Has no one entered the shimmer, sat just outside of the perimeter for a few hours, and then walked out for testing? Having someone walk in with a camera, take some footage, and then walk back out within the day would have probably been a good idea as well.

***Why didn't they send people in by vehicle on the beach to reach the lighthouse within a day?*** Unfortunately this isn't easily explained away unless people begin to lose their minds as soon as the enter the shimmer. An older car running on combustion has no excuse to not work when entering the shimmer from what we heard in the movie so... Yeah that's a rather big plot hole that needed some explanation in the film. I can imagine some awful sea-monster prevented teams by boat from entering and returning, but again, explanations to tape over plot holes would have been nice.

Cool use of an unreliable narrator. Cool visuals. Cool alien life that works in a hard-to-fathom way. No real complaints for the concepts, though the woman who thought that the bear mutant ""absorbed"" the last thoughts of the first woman it killed was really stupid conjecture for a *scientist*, it was more likely just mimicry, which fits in well with the theme and plot of the film.

Obviously the main character is no longer herself because of various mutations due to the shimmer as shown by her eyes at the end, but uh... Why did the copy of Kane get better after the shimmer got cancer and uncontrollably multiplied the fire until it died? It would have made more sense for it to die instead of suddenly getting better, with the revelation that Kane wasn't really Kane made known to the scientist because of that. Or maybe it was really Kane and leaving the shimmer was killing him because he had been in it so long that he relied on it to live? That still wouldn't make much sense if both he and the main character survived without the shimmer around any longer.

I noticed that Natalie Portman's character had the tattoo that the man who had his stomach cut open on her arm at the end of the movie as well. I'm guessing that the ""refracting"" occurs with appearances as well, so I'm willing to let that go, because DNA transfer recreating a tattoo doesn't make any sense.

I also wish the psychologist acted like... Well... A psychologist and actually gave explanations as to what was going on in the minds of the other characters that was more than just, ""Our minds are breaking down like early onset dementia"". She should have been keeping track of the mental stability of everyone else but she instead was belligerent and strong-headed.

Unfortunately I haven't read the book, so it may have explained things better than the movie. I also would have changed the title of the movie to ""Apoptosis"" based on the way things were presented, because the physics explanation fell really flat, especially with how nonsensical the theories given by the physicist were. I personally wish Christopher Nolan directed this movie, he'd most likely do a wonderful job with it based on his previous work. His brother would have most likely been a better writer for the screenplay too.

The music was pretty good for the movie, don't have any complaints.

If giving it a score, I'd probably go for 6 or 7/10. Leaning more towards 6. Careful attention to patching potential plot holes while the movie was being written would have probably made them movie an 8 or 9/10 for me. That pool scene body horror reminded me of the last of us so much!! This film is what should have happened in any other movie about aliens or parallel universes. I hate it when alien movies are ruined by aliens which look exactly like tall humans with big eyes!! I gotta say, it was a little jarring having read the book first, since the film was wildly different.  I didn't like the ending but the rest of the movie I loved.  Not sure anything has made my hair stand on end quite like [that goddamn bear screaming in Cass's voice](#spoiler) However you feel about this movie:

Holy shit, the sound design! I know everyone wants to talk about the mutated bear thing but also just the atmospheric warps and booms and horns. Just a treat for the ears.

That being said, the ending was a little too out there for me to keep up with, even after doing my best but maybe I just need to accept what we saw and not try to think about it? 

Otherwise, great flick. Really had me wondering what would happen next. I think the pacing was perfect. No boring moment for me. I feel like Helplessly Hoping by Crosby Stills and Nash was chosen for a reason. ""They are one person, they are two alone, they are three together, they are four/for each other"" certainly reminds me of the theme of cell division The scene with the bear in the house is quite possible the scariest fucking thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  

Pennywise the Dancing Clown? Never heard of him.  

Jason Voorhees? Get outta here.  

Nameless (and partially faceless) bear? Now *that’s* what I’m talking about.  

This movie has some moments that are reminiscent of *The Thing*, but that bear is the closest thing to The Thing (the alien from *The Thing*) in the entire movie.  

Also, can we talk about how the camera stays on the image of the girl’s jawless body for way too long in the best way possible? It’s so quick, maybe only a second, but it’s so disturbing. I loved this movie, it's one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in years. Great story, great soundtrack, great cinematics.

Fuck that scream-bear though, good fucking god, I've had nightmares for days. As good as Arrival; I really like weird, thoughtful Sci-fi.  Enjoyed this one. I would have sent in robots first, with pre-programmed movements. Send the first one in set to venture in just a few feet then reverse back out. Plot the next course based on what you see from it's recordings. Send it in a little deeper each time. If the videocameras worked surely they could have designed some sort of robot to do the dirty work.  I really loved this movie, and I can safely say that I have never seen anything like it. What stuck out to me most at surface level was the insanely disturbing idea of your own biology being changed by an unstoppable force, and when people described how they could see their flesh moving. That was super creepy. Also, the sound the bear made was one of the most horrific sounds I have ever heard. I really hope that the academy considers this for sound design and mixing, as it was just as bizarre an auditory experience as a visual one. Jesus fuck the screaming bear was made out of fucking nightmares is there any particular reason why virtually NO ONE discusses the last scene with [Ventress in the lighthouse - and the things she says: ""Unfathomable mind, now beacon, now sea""? that's a quote from Samuel Beckett...] (#spoiler)

I haven't really known anything about [him or his creations before](#spoiler) - so it really made me curious why this was used in the movie, and whether this is [intended to be just some ""borrowed line""](#spoiler) - or whether [she's actually quoting Beckett within the film...](#spoiler)?

and what is it supposed to mean? I liked it. My only gripe was with how they tested the Shimmer. Why not just grab specimens near the edge and study them. Or go to simple measures like tying someone to a rope and go 1 meter and then go back, next try 2 meters and then go back. They could've first figured out the DNA alteration if they did a couple of tests first. It took them what, 3 years? So me and my friends saw this at a screening a couple of days ago and I've been dying to talk about some specific questions.

If we follow the adage of ""I don't know"" (something the main characters say a lot, justifiably so) vs ""there's 2 theories, it's 1 of the 2"" (stated a few times), merge that with the whole cell division theme, we arrive at my conundrum.

Is there anything Natalie Portman says whilst being interviewed that could help us parse out whether she is still her or an alien. Because that's the 1 of 2 theories bit. You could chalk it up to idk because truly there is some part of her that was inside of that ""thing"". While the other part of me thinks she might mention something that couldn't have been fabricated by the alien, because the alien exhibited signs that it wanted to copy, not harm, when Portman went limp, it went limp, so it wouldn't necessarily lie to survive in a Darwinian sense.

Secondly, I thought it was amazing that Oscar Isaac had enough forethought to ""teach"" the thing that the white phosphorous is for holding and blowing yourself up. Without teaching it that, it never would've stood there and taken the hit when Natalie Portman gives it to it.

Just fucking genius, I will have to go see it again to settle all the small details in my head. 

Edit: lots of commas and run on's....fuck it I still can’t get over how crazy and beautiful the score was in the climax. Perfect fit for the movie.  I don't know If I have ever seen an adaptation that so heavily deviated from the source material while also staying true to it at the same time.  It's almost like they took the skeleton of the book and put all new body parts on it. There are many parts of the novel that wouldn't have worked without explaining it more or having a sequel ie. the lighthouse keeper, the name Ghostbird. But there are also portions of the book I would have liked to see play a much bigger part. Namely the hypnosis by the psychologist and what the word "" Annihilation"" means in that context. That part specifically was one of the stand out moments in the book and I wish I got to see it on screen. That being said when I heard they were making a movie I didn't think it would work and they made it work. It's nice to see a movie be ambiguous and ask questions of the audience, that is a risk not many filmmakers are willing to make these days.  Also I always seem to forget how strong of an actress Natalie Portman is. I really liked the way the alien thing was depicted. I'm a big fan of the idea that if/when we find alien life, it'll be totally different than any existing ideas or fictional depictions we have of it. The alien was confusing and hard to describe and that's awesome, it actually feels *alien*, super different. Just realized that Annihilation is asking us which part of ourselves we are going to split off into a new version of ourselves, much like the recurring motif of cell division. Individually, each one of us is an entirely different group of cells than we were 10 years ago. Our choices, and our focus, determines who we become. Life doesn't end. It just keeps morphing and changing. We absorb parts and pieces of everyone and everything in our environment, little by little. Be mindful, then, of who your crew is, and what your surroundings are. Allow yourself to divide into your highest potential!  [removed] ^^^h ^^*E* ^***l*** ***P*** ^M ^^e PLEASE

for the love of God stop taking your nine-year-old children to movies like this one. I saw today at the dollar theater, whole families with three and four kids, little ones, at least three such families that I saw. pandemonium and tears whenever shit went down, and parents telling their kids to be quiet. c’mon you fucks wait till it hits Netflix (in the USA), take your kids to Coco or something The scene where Lena is underneath the lighthouse combined with the soundtrack is the best shit I’ve ever seen.  So here’s my interpretation: The Shimmer is an allegory for grief, guilt, depression, anxiety.


The Shimmer and the journey within is an allegory for grief, depression, anxiety, or guilt. 

The women “enter” because they all suffer from something — cancer, the grief of a loss, addiction, self harm, guilt over sabotaging a happy marriage, etc.

Once inside this altered state — in which reality is still there but it’s experienced in a distorted, illogical, slightly off way — the way people suffering from emotional or psychological distress often feel — the women face a choice. Do they confront it? Overcome it? Succumb to it? Deny it’s existence?

Gina’s chacater denies it and simply tries to escape without confronting its reality. Sheppard is blindsided by it. Josie succumbs to it willingly. Ventress merely strives to understand it. Only Lena is determined to overcome it (i.e. overcome her guilt from cheating on her husband and driving him away). 

The will to resist and overcome is symbolized in the film by the delayed physical distortion of Ventress and Lena — their determination to confront the Lighthouse (or in the allegory, what’s ailing them) keeps their original selves in tact longer.

Lena literally confronts it — herself, literally getting in her own way — and finds a way to escape from this facsimile of her and destroys the shimmer (i.e. overcomes her emotional distress). 

However, although both she and Kane come through this traumatic emotional period (symbolized by The Shimmer) in tact, they are not the same people they were before entering it, just as anyone who overcomes a period of anxiety or depression is permanently altered by the experience. They are not the same person coming out the other side as they were when they went in. 

And though the Shimmer (acute period of depression or anxiety) is destroyed, they will always carry a little bit of it with them (the flicker of the Shimmer in their eyes and in Lena’s blood) — they’ve just learned to live with it and manage it. I really liked this. This is not a movie I would normally see (Thanks MoviePass!) but it was really well done and thought provoking. 

Maybe someone can explain this to me though: I didn’t quite understand the affair scenes. To me, it didn’t add much and it felt out of place. Am I wrong on this? Did I miss something important there? That bear scene. 

Holy fucking shit.  I've seen it twice, I think it's a masterpiece. One of the best sci fi films I have ever seen. 

Those final 30 minutes or so, basically everything from when she makes it to the beach to the end...unreal. 
 So to the jerk who brought his young daughters to the movie (think six and eight years old): what were you thinking, and how did it take you until the bear to bail?! It was so justified before that! The stranger I was sitting next to and I had a great conversation at your expense.  I gotta give this movie a 9/10.  Disclaimer:  I only go out to the movies, like, twice a year.

My only 2 gripes were:  First alien Kane suddenly gets better when the shimmer goes down.  I thought the shimmer, albeit growing, was a closed system.  This suggests that the shimmer has some effect outside of its zone of influence.  Second is basic dumb character moves like dropping your weapon to chase after your party member who just got yoinked into the shack.  The second gripe doesn't change the story but I like when details are paid attention to.

I read the wiki page and this paragraph stuck out:

>Due to a poorly received test screening, David Ellison, a financier at Paramount, became concerned that the film was ""too intellectual"" and ""too complicated"", and demanded changes to make it appeal to a wider audience, including making Portman's character more sympathetic and changing the ending. Producer Scott Rudin sided with Garland in his desire to not alter the film, defending the film and refusing to take notes. Rudin had final cut.[2]

So I'm thinking; who is this David Ellison guy that thinks this?

>David Ellison (born January 9, 1983) is an inbred mongoloid American film producer and the founder and CEO of Skydance Media. He was born into tons of money, and now uses it for gene therapy and making awful movies

No joke it's his wiki page.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ellison  Someone doesn't like him.

I'm glad Garland got his ending.  I would be disappointed in a lighthouse scene with a sentient alien monologuing about taking the world over and enslaving humanity with the protagonist heroically killing the alien then popping off a one liner or a pun.  I've already seen that movie, like, a million times. The mimick-bear scene HAD to have been inspired by The Thing (1982), right? Like they're tied up in chairs, chick starts questioning who's human/sane, who's not. ""Alien"" attacks while they're all trapped, causing chaos. It felt really really similar to The Thing, but maybe that's just because there's not a lot of movies with a scene involving multiple people tied to chairs and an alien presence.  spoiler tag doesn't work for me, so please: SPOILERS ahead.


i watched the movie a second time yesterday with my girlfriend, just to realise, i don't think its a great movie. now i think its a really great movie.

i really like about the movie, that it doesn't take your hand like most of hollyweirds productions these days. it's not shallow, or trivial. it has a deeper meaning and requiers a deeper understanding in some themes/metaphers. thanks for that!

i've read a few of the postings here, and really liked some of the ideas and interpretations, now i want to add some of mine:

do you guys know ""the power of 10""?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0

for me the movie mostly covers the overall theme of ""tumors"" in all its entirety. it addresses the ""cancer tumor"" inside our bodys, but also the human beeing as a ""tumor"", destroying itself - knowing or unconscious - but also its own habitat, but firstly the closest thing beside itself, its social environment (a love affair, the splitting of a couple, like a cell, just to combine itself again with something new, to ""infest"" something new, maybe to realise it doesn't fit...you can call it cheating ending up one way ;)). then ""it"" arrives, and is the next tumor, holding up a mirror to the human, as a nice metaphor of what the tumor we know is, just to show it's not ""evil"", it simply is.

now there are actually humans afflicted with tumors, which are tumors themselfs inside another tumor to investigate. that's exciting imho. :)

the movie also reminded my of ""stalker"" and ""solaris"" by tarkowsky in a good way, by keeping it original and give some unique ideas on its own. it resonates, which is always great.

it's so sad, that i wasn't be able to watch this at the cinema - even more sad, that americans were allowed to, but it ended in an boxoffice-disaster... the movie has good reviews, but nobody wants to see it/knows it. :/

what i just realized while watching it the second time:

the kane that kills itself isn't the original kane either, i think. he has an southern accent, the real one hasn't, so he's already a copy, the accent coming from imitating another crewmember/combining the two, or even someone from an older expidition maybe...

for me, the lena copy is an incarnation of her self-destroying self and as she realises, that she has to stop fighting herself to be free, the copy/mimic (still based/Created on her older self, still learning) knows, that it has no right to be anymore, also because there is probalby enough of ""it"" inside the lena leaving, but also inside the new kane outside the shimmer already... i also think, that ""it"" understands, that the ""new"" lena and the ""mimic kane"" are now a good fit, and on this planet, it will create something new through these two?! so the copy of lena inside the lighthouse destroys itself, because thats its programming as this version of lena (the circle closes ;)

the soundtrack is fantastic! the monologs and the images most of the time too and the cast is okay, imho.

the small details superb:
the glass/refraction scenes, with lena/kane only touching herself. that was fantastic.

and something important imho, regarding bad reviews and the bad boxoffice results: the movie assums more then a ""golfball sized understanding"" regarding most of its topics, some of them more complicated then watching a football game or the new thor movie ->

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2UHLMVr4vg

that sayed, i dont want to lift myself as something more intelligent, as a person, who gives the movie a thumbsdown or doesnt even want to watch it. its also interest and knowing some themes/metaphers. i am glad such movies exists. :)

wall of texts, sorry. The detail in this movie is amazing. How the glass trees where growing out of sand, because glass is made out of sand. And also the bones growing from the sand. The alien scene was mind blowing and probably my favorite scene from a movie ever. What a visual masterpiece that scene was.  Just came in to say that.... well, I absolutely loved this movie.

Saddened by the fact that everyone sat on it, but overall impressed immensely by it.

First I should say that this is the closest to generating the 'feel' of the HP Lovecraft mythos that I've ever seen. Sure, there's a lot of 80s and 70s body horror movies, and of course Jacob's Ladder, but none of those movies really compare to the feeling of dread I got when watching this movie. The only other time I've felt that kind of dread was while reading At the Mountains of Madness, so take that as  you will.

I think the only wasted thread in the whole movie was the near-duplicate house within The Shimmer and the infidelity subplot. I think that these plot points could have been removed or tightened with additional dialogue. It didn't feel like they used those two things to their full potential.

I think people who watched it and expected it to be more lucid in terms of plot were missing the point. It was very dream like, and there are few other movies that I've seen that did that dream-like state so well. I felt like I was dreaming throughout most of The Shimmer scenes, and this I felt was done on purpose.

Overall I loved the movie. Definitely in the top 3 of my favorite movies of the year so far.  I watched the movie over the weekend and I have to say that I enjoyed watching it as well as reading all the related to it.

I definitely have to say that Scream Bear was one of the more unsettling monsters I have seen in a long time. One thing that stands out on the horror of the monster was its face. Because on the right side of the face, you have a human skull blended into it. Now if you look closer at it, it also has an eye, that is very human. In addition, the eye color is the same as Cass. I am not sure, but it does seem similar.

Also, if anyone has ever read the DnD Elder Evils, there is a creature called Ragnorra which is corrupting force that is like cancer reaches a world like a comet crashing into it. Could they not take a helicopter to the lighthouse? Or parachute in? It was a waste of time just getting there and a sacrifice of a lot of men... It was one of the better ""The Colour Out of Space"" adaptations I've seen in a while. Wow I have really mixed emotions about this movie. The beginning and middle seemed to drag on longer than it should. Then there are the various scenes that didn't seem to make much sense to me. First the all girls team, nothing wrong with that but why no escort?  What about cars? Do they work in the shimmer? 

Why wasn't there a biologist in this science group before you know who shows up?

 And the first scene where they are attacked and Natalie goes all Rambo to save her comrade against what turned out to be a god damn [crocodile?   ](#spoiler) 
That scene could only work in a movie, since everyone came out amazingly ok, I mean everyone. 

Are we also going to forget that the one who goes crazy first is a [paramedic? They go through so much shit that I'm not convinced she would freak out like that, sorry movie you crazy.](#spoiler)

Also the various explanations in the movie, especially the Physical girls sounds like nonsense.

This movie seems to think its smart, but doesn't seem to show its smart. For me the main redeeming qualities are the thing that kills crazy girl ( I love its tactic), and the very last part when [Natalie sees the fractal creature and her low poly version](#spoiler) That made me like the movie a bit more. 

Also in the first scene we know [Natalie survives whatever happens](#spoiler) I did not like how this movie spoils that part even though yes we were expecting it to some degree. 

Overall the visuals were cool and all. But eh this wasn't as good as it should be. 


 Plot Twist: Lena cheated on her husband because she out he was Poe Dameron, fighter pilot for the Resistance. She was devastated that she was so old and that Anakin had died as Darth Vader and that her son Luke had died and that her daughter Leia had floated in space like Mary Poppins.  I can take the film at face value as a sci fi film.  It works completely that way.   But symbolically,  I took the film as a statement on infidelity and going through infidelity as a couple.   Once she cheats on her husband,  she is no longer the same person.   Neither is he.    At the end they come back to each other as a couple but both are entirely different people.    Also the title,  Annihilation is what infidelity does to the people involved.   (And no,  I've never been cheated on,  nor have I ever cheated.   But I've seen it happen to other people and I consider it akin to murdering your partner from the inside out.) Manbearpig was amazing.  The Alien doesn't really have motives. It's Alien in a way that we dont understand each other, not Alien as in ""human but with 4 arms and 6 eyes"". It's ""motive"" if such a thing exists for it should be seen as its ""nature"". It merges life together. In a sense it can be seen as a reverse big bang, we're all becoming one again. 

When the Alien replicates Lena it replicates her almost completely, or at least enough to replicate her desire to destroy the Alien. It may be that the Alien came to understsnd humans self destructive nature so it became complicit in destroying itself.

In the end they are both changed. Kane is replica Kane. Lenas DNA has been altered. But it doesn't matter because neither are the same person anymore. The theme of annihilation is entwined with evolution, divergence, and immortality. All of that is only found through mutation.

The shimmer is distorting everything in an attempt to find perfection, but it keeps dissolving into a kind of cancer instead. Our cells self destruct, our lives, our minds. For the shimmer, it's everything. Existence falls apart. It attempts new divisions to find something perfect.

Lena reads The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. That's your key. Cancer cells that became something more - a kind of immortality scientists still don't understand.

The fire that destroys the shimmer is a chemotherapy. Lena is freed and made perfect. Kane's connection to the failed tumor that is the shimmer is burned out.

Kane was one potential new cell, but he was sick and about to fail.

Now Lena, driven to face this cancer and survive, is another.

Next, will they continue to replicate? This movie is visually great, has a good soundtrack and you can't really complain about the photography and editing, but boy, was the screenplay a mess.

Sending in a small group of untrained scientists (and a paramedic) armed with assault rifles - with which they have brief experience, if any - and no support? Check. Making them walk through a forest, ""what are those strange things called helicopters and motorboats let them roam the forest of death and let's hope for the best""? Check. Sending in psychologically unstable people hoping they won't flunk the possibly existential-threat-level mission? Check. Not even a fucking exobiologist? Check (where is Dustin Hoffman when you need him). Not having tried before to send people in with a safety rope secured around every limb and many em-shielded cameras (which if I'm not mistaken are standard army equipment) independently secured? Check. Not having sent in a sizeable army of air-borne and ground-borne camera drones, with a pre-estabilished flight path when you figure out they lose signal? Check. Not having placed a transmitter-receiver with a shielded cable all the way from the inside to the outside of the shimmer border? Check. Not having dropped stinger missiles on the lighthouse just for good measure? Well, I would call this last one smart, if there was any hint that they were smart enough to *consider* the option.

And by the way, if you want to say that it's implied they tried all that but nothing worked, sorry but no. The outcome of any of these tests is non-trivial, we can't just infer how it would have gone to justify their failure, and I would say that after team over team of trained soldiers sent inside with no progress whatsoever, flinging in four academics and a health-worker is really not the best of moves.

And let's not even talk about the science. The *genes* are reflected inwards? Are you kidding me? That's like saying ""Oh yes, seems like the shimmer is reflecting the knots of our shoelaces, that's why we're experiencing vascular problems"". What? And mind, I'm not saying that it's impossible in a sci-fi context, I'm just saying no sane scientist who knew even remotely what they were talking about would ever propose that hypothesis without a vast, *vast* wealth of evidence, because it doesn't make any fucking sense given what we know reality.

The plants have human silhouettes and you think it's because they have *copied the human body-plans*?! That's not how this works. That's not how *any* of this works. If those plants had gotten our DNA inside them by some strange alien exofuckery, they would need to grow from a fetus-shape up, because our shape is an emergent property of our genes and first development. The plants in that scene made little sense, but what really made no sense was the biologist confirming it. What would've been way, *way* more reasonable would've been to suggest that those plants grew around human bodies like a [strangler fig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangler_fig) and then the bodies decayed away. That a plant would incorporate our DNA and then end up like a normal tree with a human profile makes absolutely no sense.

The bear thing? Please. A strange rotten bear copies the dying scream of your teammate and the first thing you can think about is that it absorbed her DNA, **and therefore her mind?!** THAT'S utter bullshit. What about parrots? What about blackbirds? Was [aggressive mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggressive_mimicry) too mundane for the *biologist* to consider?

And the ending. God the ending.

Good use of an unreliable narrator, I'll grant the direct that, but the glowing irises at the end were the most heavy-handedly shoehorned exposition I've seen in a long time.

Overall, I can't believe they had the doubt that their movie would end up being [too intelligent](https://www.imdb.com/news/ni61802450) for their audience. Wow, good thing they managed to dodge that bullet.

Amazing acting though. They really nailed that.

Edit: grammar. I fucking loved that it ate their throats/voice boxes and that's how it did it. Fucking insane.  Question about this. Hope it gets some visibility.

[The bear didn't eat Shepherd. It ate her throat and then left pretty much the entire body untouched. At the same time, the group was in the Shimmer for ""months"" and yet they did just fine without months worth of food and clean water. Maybe the bear doesn't actually need to eat, and it's just running on the instinct that it needs to hunt? My other theory is that it ate part of Shepherd, and she became part of the bear, and being part of the bear decided to stop eating herself.](#spoiler)

Thoughts? It was fucking brilliant. So unexpected and so horrifying.  that bear scene terrified me to the core. the errie screaming sound it made bypassed any and all fear checks in my brain and struck like a lightning bolt at my fear center. if it had made any other noise than that twisted human scream, I think I would have been ok. but now there's a monster that haunts my nightmares. It reminded me of the movie The Ruins when the plants mimic the sound of the human voices, which really creeped me out.  There can be 2 reasons for that strange call. The bear either acquired a mimicry trait from its prey or the shimmer caused their Dna to mix and the scream was carried on to the bear.  More importantly, it's one water trail that seperates into two, kind of implying that she's taken the cell mutation concept with her back out of the shimmer.  Yeah that really confused me. I thought they would bring up the fact that the houses looked the same but it was never acknowledged  There are glasses of water refracting light scattered in scenes throughout the movie.  I have no idea as to their significance, but the camera lingers on them quite a lot. Everything is refracted in The Shimmer. There’s no way to know at the end if her memories are even her own. She has a tattoo that belongs t another member of the party, what else did she pick up? It's late and I didn't want your thoughtful post to be buried before anyone could see it. Thank you for your analysis, I saw this film a few hours ago and I've been laying in bed thinking about and I think your idea of personal transformation is a dead on thought. 

The alien substance transformed the land in monstrous and/or beautiful ways. I think that is the nature of transformation, it is *nature* chaotic yet logical. I liked your idea of having to destroy before we can create. We have to destroy and transform before we become something new, just like those replicating cells.  I 100% agree. The movie isn't about ""self destruction"" it's about dealing with grief/traumatizing experiences.  An all consuming vortex that moulds the world around you.  

The self destruction angle is only about what drives them into the shimmer not what the shimmer is.  The shimmer is the transformative process/disorienting haze we lose ourselves  in. The lighthouse is the reflection of ourself/the epicenter of the catalyst for change.  No matter what happens the person who emerges is not the same as the one who entered. After reading for like an hour, I'm pretty sure yours is the best explanation!! 

Also yeah, something something ego death and reaching enlightenment??? Rosie who, LITERALLY BECOMES one with nature, Dr Ventress in her more without a choice death to cancer/giving in/-exsplosy, and shimmer Kane and Lena at the end, kind of coming back from a crazy LSD trip, also have reached this ""enlightenment"" and reached this state of 'understanding' in a much more physical form, almost like they're the new Buddhas??! I'm mostly saying these last 3 lines because that's seems like it was my experience after a trip, and many others, and probably these crazy writers too hah, maggie and milly and molly and may   
went down to the beach(to play one day)  

and maggie discovered a shell that sang   
so sweetly she couldn’t remember her troubles,and  

milly befriended a stranded star  
whose rays five languid fingers were;  

and molly was chased by a horrible thing   
which raced sideways while blowing bubbles:and  

may came home with a smooth round stone   
as small as a world and as large as alone.  

For whatever we lose(like a you or a me)   
it’s always ourselves we find in the sea  

ee cummings There's also Shepard's remark about the person she was dying at the same time as her kid >But I think the Shimmer actually represents something more- a place people find themselves at times in their lives, a sort of mental purgatory where some kind of facing of fears and personal change is required in order to move on. Some kind of ""self-destruction"" might be a necessary part of that process, if one needs to shed parts of themselves that hold back progress. It also requires facing your anger and deepest anxieties. And like Josie says, some people when they encounter a stage of personal transformation, will be eager to face it, some will fight it, and some might just peacefully accept. 

That's that Silent Hill shit. One of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a long time.  Gina Rodriguez’s jaw was....I don’t know...somewhere on the floor I guess After they watched the footage of of the bowel dissection in the pool area, the guy sitting next to me simply stood up and walked out. He didn't leave during the scene, he waited till it concluded, and then just decided it wasn't for him. Left without looking back. :P
 There were a few of those scenes for me. Cutting dude’s stomache open to play with his worm intestines was crazy as shit, but then seeing the result in the pool was easily as crazy just for how great it looked. That was some a+ sci fi horror imagery. This movie was metal as fuck, and I appreciate that.  The tension in the theater was palpable during that scene. So many people were just moaning from fear. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything quite like that happen at the movies before. I could've sat in the theater for another hour just listening to the score & watching those credit visuals Not sure if it's what you're talking about, but the music for the scene where Lena is looking into the center of the cloud/alien creature was called The Mark by Moderat I loved the inclusion of that book in the flashback, definitely was fitting  I believe the theme of this movie is what looks terrible to you (how the cells that killed Henrietta would appear to her), could be good for a lot of other things in the system. Another example is when the animals feed on the scientists. The animals are just doing that to create something new, like a horrific screaming bear. Another is annihilation, it may seem scary to you, but the movie suggests it's a natural process of biology's systems and you should accept it. 


The boyfriend feared thinking like a system (his mind was flowing) and so he killed himself. I believe this was a representation of ego death, as the ego is the only thing that fears selfless systemic thinking (the ""we are all one"" way of thinking; enlightenment). I believe the infinite alien anus represents your consciousness, as many people believe that consciousness at it's baseline or in it's pure form, is an infinite consciousness state. 


The mimicry is a metaphor for how your consciousness mimics what it experiences in the real world. An example of this is how dreams mimic the real world. If you strip all of the mimicry away, you experience the baseline infinity state of consciousness. I believe this movie is promoting to strip all of your preconceived notions, or mimicry, away  and think systemically. WOW. I knew a bit about the book and I had done a *lot* of thinking about the Physicist's speech before she walked into the trees. But I didn't realize how they are connected in such a profound way. This is an amazing connection.  This is doubly true when considering that the cells shown dividing in her lecture at the beginning were, in her words, ""female cervical cancer cells"" and were most likely HeLa cells. The part that struck me was the part you quoted: ""it must be horrible to die scared and in pain and only having your screams of fear live on as the only remnant of you"". 

As somebody who has seen a lot of family die of cancer, this line struck me hard. The one thing they feared the most was being remembered (having their last remnant) be of their pain and suffering. Of those last agonizing moments before the disease took them. The bear was that fear in the flesh. And it made it all the more terrifying to me. 

I need to read these books now.  And score! Holy shit was that score amazing! Agreed. She really nailed a lot of subtle reactions that made her relationship with Kane very believable. I think she took a lot of risks in this movie acting wise and it paid off. At times, the dialogue was goofy, but all of the actors were amazing. For Natalie Portman, on top of the scene you mentioned, the one was she starts heavily sobbing once she is on her own was amazing. Also, imagine being Oscar Isaac and having to act out coughing up blood and having a seizure. 

Plus, Gina Rodriguez did panic so well, especially during the scene where they are tied up to chairs. Tessa Thompson was so good at going back and forth between fear and acceptance. I didn’t care too much for this movie and don’t intend on seeing it again but I thought all of the performances were great. She’s the best actress working right now in my opinion Yes, I was reminded of the alien being set on fire. The visuals we're similar.  I was waiting for that music to play the entire movie. It was mesmerizing. White knuckle tension, was sure it’d kill her and take on her persona  I was SO hoping that sound from the trailer was in the movie. Def not dissapointed. Sonoya Mizuno, the dancer in this [Chemical Brothers video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC2dRkm8ATU) and featured prominently in Garland's last movie *Ex Machina*, is credited as one of Natalie Portman's students in the opening scene and as the ""Humanoid"".  I think the humanoid was Lena's mirror self in that scene, and I think the dual role is very fitting since it draws a parallel between the student, learning from Lena, and the avatar of the 'shimmer' studying her in the lighthouse.  Even though it was CGI with inhuman proportions you could definitely tell that someone was actually there interacting with Natalie Portman, just based on how she reacted to it.  You could feel the weight when it pushed against her and the delicate emotion as it mimicked her unconscious pose.  The movie was a masterclass in special effects.  Old school mixed with the new.   Not only that but let’s leave a lantern on right in front of our eyes. “I can’t see anything!” THEN TURN THE FUCKING LIGHT OFF.  I took it more as Ventress had wandered out to the stand on her own. When Lena comes out of the tower she looks around the side to see where Ventress is and only then does she notice that there was a light out in the stand. I thought it was just another example of Ventress feeling like she was running out of time and wanting to know more so she went exploring during her guard shift.  Same!! It made no sense. It was like they wanted to be eaten. At least maybe Shepherd did since she could’ve at least entered the guard shed instead of standing there.  I was getting kind of annoyed that they didn't just drive a dune buggy down the beach to the lighthouse.  Why turn a 2 hour ride into a 7 day walk when you can be pretty sure you're getting blasted by some kind of extradimension radiological tomfoolery. Thank you! Yes! They made sooooo many STUPID moves.

""We just barely killed this brazen, obviously mutated crocodile. Duuhhh, lets take the boats over this murky, likey infested crocodile water.""

""Lets NOT all stay together atop the tower over night which boldens our safety and gives us advantage""

""Oh no, using my night vision specs i can see something ripped through the fence. Let me put down my fucking night vision goggles and aim my gun into the dead, unforseen night!""

But its also consistantly brought up that losing ones mind in the shimmer is inevitable, so maybe their stupidity was a sympton? lol I thought the exact same thing. It had to be on purpose, but the fact that Natalie Portman didn't react to it confused me.  Yes it’s identical and on purpose. There’s even some direct camera shots that are used in the beginning.  That's one of those things I will never ever forget from a movie. What a brilliant idea, I don't know if it was in the book but that was amazingly disturbing. Ed...ward The scream bear scene is where the major metaphor dawned on me. The shimmer is cancer (obviously) but the characters all represent different approaches to dealing with it. 
The scream bear represents the how people remember someone suffering through chemo. Her character had lost a daughter to leukemia and mentioned how it basically killed her former self. She represents fighting and losing painfully, dying in misery and your family and friend’s memory of you is forever replaced by your final pain. 
The physicist represented those who chose not to fight and suffer. Ultimately she dies, but without pain, and peacefully and she leaves behind a pleasant memory. 
The psychologist represents the psychologic trauma and depression that cancer victims have. 
The EMT represents denial. She accuses the others of inventing the bear, and just wants to “go back” but there is no going back.  Additionally, she has a substance abuse past, probably a call to those who turn to addiction or self medicating. 
The biologist represents intellecualizing the situation. A defense mechanism where people just try to keep gathering information, and think if they can understand it, they can regain control. 

When she escapes, she is kept in isolation, a common thing for cancer patients. The scientist interviewing her with all the young scientist watching are like residents on rounds in a hospital. 

The clones represent how nobody is ever the same after surviving cancer. The anthroplogist who’s daughter died of leukemia said as much earlier in the film. 

Finally, her and Kane at the end represent how even a tiny bit of remaining cancer can restart the whole process. They metastasized away from the primary tumor, and though the primary tumor was destroyed, they cancer threat remains. 


Edit: thanks for the gold  Legit shivers from the creepiness when it first walks in. What a fantastically fucked up monster idea. [deleted]   This movie, and this scene in particular, reminded me so much of The Thing. Whoever conceived that needs some fucking help. I am not ok. Man, you ain't kidding. I want to use it in an RPG this weekend. Like, before anyone gets the reference because it was soooooo good.  My head started spinning with ideas when I heard the scream and then the chomp from the bear when Gina’s character ran out the door . The voice thing was just beyond cool and creepy . There were a few times I was tended up in my chair last night .  I’d say this and the monster from Netflix’s The Ritual both have great designs for creepiness. But that human voice definently freaked me out! I couldn't fall asleep last night cause of that thing...  [deleted] People in the other thread are referring to it as the ScreamBear. Pretty iconic and terrifying.  I'm surprised nobody mentioned Kane had a bear tattoo and the bear walks inside their copy of the house. I think the bear was trying to protect Natilie Portman from that lady who tied them up. Sat next to a dad WHO BROUGHT HIS TWO KIDS to the movie! They were probably 6 and 7. Pretty sure they're going to be scarred for life. I bet Alex Garland watched The Revenant and was like, ""I can make a scarier bear scene than that.""  The final act is the definition of harrowing. The pacing really reminded me of Alien (1979). Long, slow build up in the first act with mounting tension throughout the rest of the film really, the movie could have been just a *bit* longer, giving us a little more time with each of the three minor characters, and the pacing would have been fine. We really only got one character-drive scene with each. Was that Josie? On the bright side, people overseas can watch it over and over as many times as they want without burning a hole in their pocket like I'm about to.  [deleted] Yes it does.  It's like Bladerunner 2049 from last year, I tried to tell everyone I knew that if they had any interest in seeing it, it needed to be in theaters, and this is the same way.  The way it's shot, the music and the sounds, need to be done on a giant screen and with at least 12 speakers surrounding you.   Kudos.  Thank you for your very interesting take of the Shimmer as depression.  But it does seem to make sense as one of the many metaphors in the movie.  Some people describe depression as a dark cloud over them or being in a dark hole where perception and memory are distorted.  Sometimes one has to let go of the past destructive self in order to move on.  Yes sometimes we are our own worst enemy for change.    Thank you for your take, it really resonates with me and is exactly how I read the film on a personal level. The moment with Gina's character wasn't really the blood that got me. It was that she thought she was right when she went out the down and we heard the bear chomp. It was a perfect intro to a fucking creepy ass scene. The shot that creeped me out the most was a few minutes after that, when [the plants were growing out of Josie's scars.](#spoiler) Thank you!  This is what i believed the ending to be as well.  I keep reading explanations and interpretations online that think Lena died in the shimmer and her duplicate made it out.  The whole reason the shimmer was destroyed in the end was because she wasn't a self destructive person like the rest of the team.  As you said the rest of the team was chosen by the doctor possibly because of their self destructive tendencies or perhaps she unconsciously chose people similar to herself (dying and not wanting to return).  This is also why the military teams never made it out: as soldiers who are constantly facing their mortality they would have to come to terms with death on a daily basis.  However, Lena was an unintentional last minute addition who had a reason to live or go on.   yep, everything gets scrambled. if tattoos (nonngenetic) can get transferred, accents probably do too Pretty sure he had the accent the whole time pre-Shimmer death. It's the Shimmer clone of Kane that has no accent. Dude the set design in this movie blew me away! Was glad the set designer got credit in the trippy credits reel. [deleted] It reminded me of the TV show Hannibal

There's a lot of very similar arrangements of human body parts and such following murders. The show itself has many flaws, but artistically it is probably one of the most beautifully haunting shows I've ever seen.  Am I wrong or did the arm that was up on the wall have the same tattoo as Natalie Portman’s character? Both scenes in the pool were beautifully crafted. First, with Kane and the solders in the dark with water diffused light and of course the scene you mentioned above. So damn good.
 It was very The Last of Us. Hell alot of the design was very LoU. Buy a PS4 and buy The Last of Us Remastered. The imagery is very similar, and equally gorgeous. I hadn't the book but I was glad that I knew it was a trilogy going in because I would have been so confused by the ending. I mean I was confused anyway, but I feel like the movie definitely set itself up for more.

Do you think it's worthwhile to read the books after watching the film? I remember me and my buddy back in 2010 making joke skits for my class about the manbearpig. The manbearpig is no fucking joke anymore  Al Gore warned us *Wo*manbearpig Wait what? I thought the tessellating creature Portman encounters was very clearly supposed to be the Crawler (just without the writing, or actual crawling, for that matter). When she peers into it and her drop of blood is absorbed it accomplishes the same purpose as when the Crawler psychically invades her in order to create her duplicate. Similarly the bear was pretty clearly the Moaning Creature. In both cases I think Garland made some very intelligent decisions in cutting down the ambiguity and complexity of their parts of the story, but I still thought they were clear allusions to their book counterparts. Didn't read the book, what am I missing? That whole book was so vague on everything except for her terrible love life which I found myself not having any connection too. Meanwhile Area X, the thing I wanted to know more about, was just a bunch of colors, misshapes, and noises.  I really wish he'd tried. Or at least we'd gotten more of The Tower. 

I loved the movie, but The Tunnel/Tower is one of my favorite *things* in all the books I'd read. I was excited to see someone take a stab at it. There was a lot more than the crawler that didn't make it into the movie from the book. The movie adapted the basic premise and atmosphere, but the rest of the movie was completely different from the book. It moved and it was also on the soldier who got cut open. She peers at her forearm at one point and when asked whats wrong she shrugs it off as a bruise. I think this is the point it started to appear. It moved to symbolize self destruction. It was an infinite ouroboros forever eating itself.  This was one of the biggest things I noticed and was hoping was being discussed here. It doesn’t appear on Lena until after the crocodile incident where she suddenly notices a “bruise” appearing on her arm. I think someone inside the shimmer had the tattoo and as the shimmer stared refracting and shuffling DNA it began spreading to people exposed to the shimmer. I noticed that too. what was the significance of the tattoo?? I think after they encounter the crocodile they show Lena's arm with a bruise on it, and it explicitly doesn't have the tattoo on it at that point. But you start to notice it appearing on people's arms as the movie unfolds. From seeing countless adaptations of anthropomorphized aliens in films since I was a kid, I have always wanted to see an alien depicted on screen as something completely foreign and detached from humanity than I have seen before. 

I feel like this film accomplished that in a big way with the encounter scene.  When she was trying to run and it was shoving her trying to crush her and then she realizes that SHE'S crushing herself and just relaxed and it relaxes. Holy moly.  The part where its face morphed into Portman's face really fucked with me. It just looked so *wrong* as it was transforming.  that was definitely the loudest i can ever remember inside a theatre. i wonder how they got to do that? [deleted] Hey I noticed the sound start to crackle right around this part too, never had that happen in a theater before. I wonder if some theaters are gonna be pissed I believe the clone wasn't trying to prevent her escape; it was just mirroring her. She was pressing hard against the door, so it was pressing hard against her. As soon as she relaxed and fell away, so did it.  Anyone else see the male and female deer creatures as foreshadowing for a male and female human duplicate? What do you think the physics woman meant when she said Lena wants to fight it and the cancer woman wants to face it.. im some where in between.. and then she rapidly grows leaves off her arms and then she is gone in the field... I guess symbolizing her became a plant person.. but they explained the plant people as plants that mirrored human DNA structure.. like our shape.. but how did you interpret her understanding of the shimmer? Can you like join it?  She was not the original Dr. Ventress. Just like how Lena's shimmer copy didn't have eyes for a second before she was fully formed, Dr. Ventress' shimmer copy finished forming.

This means that we do not know the fate of the original Dr. Ventress. And I believe the point is to make us question the fate of all the originals. Kane and more importantly, Lena, in the real world are not assured of which one they are, copy or original. WHY WERE THEY UPSIDE DOWN!?  Just want to make sure I understand - the shimmer flicker in her eyes was just meant to be a lasting effect of being in it, right? Or was it an implication that she was the copy? Her being the copy seemed pretty damn impossible but her eye shimmer confused me.  I could see it being a sleeper hit [deleted] The acoustic guitar line also reminded me of TLOU Yeah I agree he had it the worst out of any characters we see in the film.  The books are massively different, much more psychological with less of a horror element. The second book was my favorite of the trilogy. I felt the movie captured the spirit of the first book well though. 

If you get it through Audible search Area X. It's the 3 book trilogy and you can pick it up for 1 credit.  Yeah, a lot of the sets and scenery were definitely reminiscent of TLOU- the entire village and fort area, and the swimming pool corpse in particular. I thought the exact same thing. Also some of the music was reminiscent of the game It was the guitar playing that totally tied it to The Last is Us for me.  He did say recently that he loves the game. Watching them wander through Area X was definitely evocative of an acid trip. I was sort of thinking the same thing. Just cut out all the spooky parts and you have a pretty Trippy 35 minute short film to watch As soon as possible as possible? I agree on all counts. It’s only February, but the bear scene will likely be my favorite of the year. There’s a lot of sci-fi I’ve never seen before. Unfortunately, the dialogue was often weak, which is especially surprising since Ex Machina has such a tight and polished script.  You may enjoy reading “A Roadside Picnic” Agreed on the dialogue, I thought it was extremely stilted at moments. I get that the characters were self-destructive in particular ways, but at times they felt like representations of humans than actual people.

The professor dude trying to convince Lena... ”we share an intellectual and emotional connection” ... what the hell was that.  I think this is why I like Existential/Cosmic Horror & Science Fiction the most. It's the only genre that attempts to express the complexity and mystery of our experience. Of course, I also like thinking about the bigger questions from time to time.  Funny you mention Lovecraft, I was reminded a little of the colour from space I was spooked My interpretation of the burning of the lighthouse was a bit different. I thought the clone, as it morphed into Lena, began to take on her emotional traits and memories, as well as her appearance. As its transformation completed, or neared completion, it started to feel the weight of Lena’s loss (knowing her husband is dead). That’s why it caresses the burnt body’s cheek as it itself burns and why it crawls around, seemingly purposefully spreading the flames throughout: it has somewhat gained Lena’s motivations and emotions and memories. It’s an existential horror movie. Everything is truly alien, in that doesn’t follow the rules of our world, mostly. To me, it’s the movie that vest captures the idea of the abyss that stares back. 

The line that I think tells the whole story and captures the true horror is what all the characters say when asked what the Shimmer is, “I don’t know”. I think the concept of the shadow form is quite nicely exemplified with the ['deer scene'.](https://moviepaws.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/annihilation.png?w=700) One of the deers has beautiful snow white fur whilst the other is dirtier, with skull protruding and no flowers growing on it's antlers. Yet they dance and prance off in perfect synchronicity. They are so 'in-sync' that you don't notice there are two of them at first (almost like the unconscious.) David Lynch always says that films should be more about what you feel afterward rather than the analysis. He says ""Cinema is like life: you can’t put it under one word – it’s far too complex for that. It’s different things to different people.""

Which can be frustrating, because especially with his films there's just so many interesting things to break down and talk about.

But ultimately I agree, the feeling you get after watching a film speaks louder than any analysis ever could. After watching Annihilation, I felt much more satisfied than I did watching pretty much any other movie this year. It creates an atmosphere, tells a story, and takes you in. Really beautiful film This movie is unusual for a horror film, with almost no jump scares and no real ""villain"". However, I would agree that I was a lot more frightened in this than most modern ""horror"" movies. Atmosphere does a hell of a lot to increase tension.  I was not prepared for that at all. Jesus christ that is the scariest movie I've ever seen. Horror has never gotten to me before now. Rian Johnson said to see it ""in the loudest theater possible"". And I remember thinking like half way through that it didn't really make sense. Then the Alien started burning everything and that rumbling starts just RIPPING through the speakers, and I was so happy I listened to him [deleted] I didn't notice it on the other woman, but at some point we do see Portman's arm when she talks about a bruise, and then see her with it in the zone before reaching the lighthouse..

I think it's the zone ""refracting"" parts of them onto eachother, like the DNA getting mixed up or the bear having the woman's dying voice. So at the end we aren't supposed to know what the aliens planned? Good or bad? That was my interpretation since the scientists were actually questioning who they Thought was Lena. 





Is that correct? 

  I agree with a lot of what you said, and wrote it up on another site I belong to but you covered most of it so I won't post here.  BUT, I think a key addition is, that our self-destructive nature hinders us from joining evolution rather than becoming a victim to it.  In a non-human, grand-scheme view, the ending is actually a happy one ... a higher form of human and/or life is emerging.  But our ideas of being human, and our inability to give in to that hard-coded truth, prevents us from accepting it.  The only two characters who seem to embrace this are Dr. Ventress (who becomes a new being) and Josie (fate unknown, but possibly becomes a human/plant hybrid of some sort).  Everyone else panics, shoots, runs, etc.  But we can't out-run our biological fate of dying out.  Lena presumably destroys The Shimmer, but it's essentially too late ... a male AND female human/Shimmer hybrid now exist on Earth, and will presumably replicate and usher in the next stage of life. Agreed, I loved this movie too. Saw it right after 'A Quiet Place,' which was basically one big plothole. Like, duh, you spend all this time building a surveillance system and a soundproof baby box and don't bother to make a soundproof room??? Wtf, the military never thought to use sound weapons against a creature which relies on sound? I remember just starting to laugh at one point during 'The Quiet Place,' it was so unbelievable. This sounds snooty, but i feel like im the only one who cares about the meta narrative? The story is about loss and regret and memory and all that good shit. At the beginning when he comes back and sits at the table, I though for sure it was about alcoholism, but then I realized it was about infidelity and a failing marriage. 

She comes back to her husband and goes, 'are you the same person?'
and he says 'i dont think so, are you Lena?'
The answer is of course not. She went through an experience and came out a different person. They are both different people now, but they still embrace. 

It's supposed to be a sweet moment, not a moment of sci-fi mystery...right? Yes! This movie really surprised me with how brutal it was willing to get. The visceral scariness of that big deformed creature smashing her against a wall, dragging her back when she tried to crawl for her life, and then ripping her apart was unrelentingly scary.

And I'm glad we're mentioning the Thing references, tied to chairs and gagged while the increasingly unhinged team members try to sort out which of them is human, until oops! monsters. I really enjoyed it but thought Ex Machina was better I loved this movie, but this is one of the things that took me out. They took pretty much no precautions during the whole thing, and it seemed like they just tried the same thing over and over again. lol they traumatized their little shits with this movie > Maybe someone can explain this to me though: I didn’t quite understand the affair scenes. To me, it didn’t add much and it felt out of place. Am I wrong on this? Did I miss something important there?

Lena's affair was her husband's (Kane) motivation for going into the shimmer in what's essentially a suicide mission.  It ties into the main theme of the human pathology for self-destruction.  (In this case the self-destruction of a relationship.)

This is specifically referenced in a few scenes, especially in the scene where Lena asks the psychologist for a profile of Kane and why he volunteered to enter the shimmer.  The psychologist mentions something about the destruction of a ""happy marriage""  - cut to a knowing reaction shot of Lena.    The explanation that everything inside is not jamming electrical signals but diffusing them. You could argue that any semi-complicated technology would stop working inside. Imagine flying a helicopter when the computer is randomly flipping bits internally and so on... > but why no escort? 

Lena was the escort. She has all the military experience. (And of course the major benefit of being a biologist) 

>Why wasn't there a biologist in this science group before you know who shows up?

This bugs be too.  3 years and no scientists?  Seems like even a throw-away line could have taken care of that. 

>crazy first is a paramedic

Seems reasonable that ANY human being could panic and go into denial in a situation like that.  I think the whole movie was about Lena getting to be with a version of her husband that doesn’t know she cheated on him. 

This was a joke but that’s kind of what happens in the end.  You encapsulated my thoughts perfectly. It's one of those movies where everything is great except the writing. Concept, visuals, soundtrack, acting, all of that was cool but the plot itself is so flawed. In addition to the idiotic mission plan and nonsensical ending I still don't get how the Oscar Isaac colonel made it to Natalie Portman's house. oh...so it was like that..thanks I didn't put that together until reading this comment...fuck that's creepy. I'm not sure the same bear attacked them the first time and the second time. Or to put it more bluntly it had time to evolve between encounters. It looked like it had part of her skull stuck to the side of it's head.

Don't think you need to worry about spoilers in these threads. I agree with others that the bear was not the same creature as the attack in the field, doesn't seem to fit unless it did mutate between then and the house scene.

Also, as far as food goes, when Lena is being deposed after returning from the shimmer the guy says ""You only had rations for 2 weeks, you were there for nearly 4 months.. what did you eat?""

You don't see the women eat much while they're in there. I'm guessing mutations are cause appetite suppression or something. Fauna is just exploding and everything is changing. Seems reasonable to assume consumption of food is lower than normal in the shimmer.  Yeah, I think since they were merging with the ecosystem, it was keeping them alive. But maybe whenever the animals eat, it also feeds everything else. I wonder if the crocodile wanted to eat too. In literally the first scene of the movie Lena is asked what she ate, to which she responded that she don’t remember eating.

The guy debriefing her stated that they had rations for two weeks and they were in there for four months, so that seems to support your theory. And 100% what every cancer sufferer fears - being remembered for your final moments of agony instead of who you were. 

This fucking film keeps hitting me, and it's been hours since I saw it. 

Edit: I know Ventress was the one with cancer, but the whole film is about cancer. It's literally ""what if our planet got cancer?"" [deleted] I think it was the DNA merging and the bear having the human knowledge that cry would bring her friends I'd have to look at some pictures to be sure, but part of the bear's skull (I think where one eye should have been) had what looked like some human teeth/skull structure. So I think it developed a body structure that essentially was a copy of Shepard's vocal cords during a scream. So when air was forced through its throat, or in certain ways, it would also pass through the adapted structure and create the sound of Shepard screaming. The new structure may have had some basic reflexes that helped create the sound as well. I really don't think it was intentional on the poor bear's part.  I think it was what they suggested in the movie that beyond the refraction of DNA refraction of thought was occurring as well and a piece of her screaming dying consciousness was transferred to the bear in her final moments. Yes! That was what I was thinking too.  No kidding, it almost appeared, for a moment, that Lena had a sense of recognition as she pauses at the bottom of the stairs for a brief moment. I was a little confused as to why they would make them look so similar but not being touched on. I think that's part of why I like this movie. It seems to me that there is so much more going on (that is very intentional) than what we're explicitly told. The house and the tattoo are both perfect examples. No one ever addresses the tattoos transferring from one character to at least two others but it's there. Then there's the house which not only is laid out exactly like the original, but so are the shots yet again no one addresses it explicitly. 

The meaning behind the tattoo is pretty clear but the house I think is less so. We don't need it for Anya to go mental on Lena because there's already the clear shot of him on the first video and her locket, so it must serve another purpose. Dude a few rows down


"".............what....the..........FUCK"" I guess that's all he could stomach :) That's the scene where I first saw that this movie was going to be something special. The psychosis factor laced throughout the film was my favorite aspect and the tone of said psychosis began right there.  Yeah it started to play again during the credits after that reveal in the end, the soundtrack to this movie was so incredible.  This NEEDS to have an extended version. 1:37 is too short for this. I love how you just casually threw the phrase ""infinite alien anus"" into the middle of that insightful analysis. You had me at alien anus.   ""I believe this movie is promoting to strip all of your preconceived notions, or mimicry, away and think systemically.""

I agree with this so damn much. The people who resist this process of stripping away preconceived belief systems are the ones who die. Lena faces her shadow, and destroys it with Light. Kane allows his shadow to survive, but sacrifices himself to Light. 
Ventress becomes consumed wholly by the light.  

I think the bones on the beach show that the others who came before fought with their shadows, or preconceived notions, to the death. They continued to resist.  If by amazing you mean nightmare inducing and/or bizarrely soothing then yes   I loved the bit at the end, but I felt they used that guitar piece too much. It intruded on so many scenes that would have been better with ambience of environment, imo. It was the only thing I didn't like about the movie. Subtleties really seem to be Portman’s strongest suit. Sometimes she seems to be under-acting or at least understated, but she’s constantly fkn *nailing* the less obvious nuances. The moments between the “beats” is her strongest stuff. Like the acting equivalent of negative space usage in other art forms. While many actors play pop, Portman is jazz. Also she doesn't blink or flinch when firing the assault rifle which is badass, in itself.  So many actors --even action movie stars-- unconsciously shut their eyes when they fire live weapons, its impressive when you see an actor whose prepared enough to have that instinct trained out of them.   Oh I hated Gina Rodriquez in this movie. That’s a sign she did a great job.  Sometimes I like to imagine that movies like that are actually in the same world, like that Under The Skin is the sequel to Annihilation. Same goes for Ex Machina being the prequel to West World- I mean obviously they aren’t, but they could be, haha. Well it pretty much did  The trailer music is a little different than the music they played in another scene just prior, but I recognized it almost immediately as a song by the group Moderat - here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6twHZCfGtQ Yeah that super bugged me too! Right when they heard something they didn't even turn it off. wtf I just saw it, and that was definitely my interpretation. Lena looked around the walkway in both sides, expecting the Dr. to be up in the tower with them. The Dr. was becoming reckless and impatient. > It was like they wanted to be eaten. 

Remember that whole monologue about people impulsively destroying themselves, even when they don't really mean to? [deleted] It wasn't in the book, but if anything, the book is *creepier*. You’re a heartless monster S
T
O
P You could simplify it into dealing with change and it would still work, movie points you into that direction with the whole refraction theme.  Jesus. Wow, I've seen two youtube videos trying to discuss the movie, but your post makes the most sense. Booo. I like your interpretation, but I feel it takes so much of the magic of the film away to make it just about cancer. Sounded like Cass, cause it was her voicebox! That scene and then the blooming corpse hole, for lack of a better phrase, really solidified The Thingyness for me.  Alex Garland conceived it, but the guy who actually made it is apparently the same one who made the Paddington bear.  Someone in your group: hey i read that in a book somewhere

you: STFU The music during the last part of the movie is absolute perfection. Yeah.  MoviePass When the volume cranks up to 11 , I lost my shit . The theater speakers started to crackle and it just added to it all  You mean the part where the blood comes out of her eye and goes into that other scientists dna floating thing and the sound is just like BRUAAANNBBGGHHUUMMNNVVVGGG Not only that but the Shimmer was purposefully depicted as being a place of strange and sometimes disturbing beauty. Sometimes from the extreme suffering depression brings can spawn things of unimaginable wonder.  You see this in artists all the time; it is very easy to stay lost in the escape that these inventions bring. For me, it was the sheer terror and implications of the scene. Nature is fucking ruthless. I kept imagining what that scene would be like in real-life, minus Sheppard’s scream.  Weirdly enough I actually found that part really calming. Compared to the violence it was beautiful how she became one with the shimmer and nature. Also made me really think about all the other human shaped flower plants differently.  I think a lot of the people saying she died and her duplicate is the one that made it out missed a key line from Ventress just before she goes off on her own. She says something along the lines of wanting to face the lighthouse as herself; as who she is in that moment, and not whoever she’ll become given enough time in the shimmer to change and mutate into a different person. To me the Lena at the end wasn’t the duplicate, but she wasn’t the same Lena who went into the shimmer either. She had mutated as a person. Yeah I thought I was crazy when I noticed the tattoo Portman has at the beginning interrogation scene wasn't there when she first entered the shimmer. Then I saw the tattoo on the lesbian one (I don't remember her name) and noticed it switch to Portman. I thought that line was the most authentic of the film. I legitimately got chills with that line after seeing the corpse  Real talk, Hannibal was fucking intense and graphic on the gore/violence scale for a cable network prime time show. Loved it. It did, the paramedic had it on her arm at one point too. The ending of the movie was changed to be WAY more conclusive than the book. I highly doubt the other two books will be adapted, the movie made the plotlines from them impossible. Yes, absolutely. It is a short and interesting read. Plus, there are a few awesome concepts such as [hypnosis and a different ""monster""](#spoiler)

It will also give a little clarity to a few of the concepts in the film.  Yes it's worth a read. You'll basically see another adaption of the same story. You'll encounter a few changes along the way, but the tone and feeling is something this movie captures very well. Just like Ex Machina.... They could absolutely do an awesome sequel, but they won’t and that’s ok. 100% definitely read the first book, though I think it's important to say that Garland changed/simplified a lot making this adaptation.

Comparing just the first book to the movie, I think the movie does more to explain what's going on in its story than the book does in its own.  

The second book does present more information that I think helps understand the events of the movie and the first book. But to me, the first book is a patient experiencing an illness/dying, and the second feels like a doctor rattling off the physical findings of an autopsy. You'll get a broader picture that helps contextualize things in the first book but it just leads to more questions (like the patient saying they feel like they're drowning and the doctor finding that their lung were filling with fluid which then leads to the question ""why did their lungs fill with fluid?"")

I haven't finished the third book yet, but from what I've read from people that have it leaves you asking more questions and doesn't really give you satisfying answers.     

 I’m super cereal  In the tunnel, there was a creature writing on the wall. We later find out that creature was the lighthouse keeper. This creature, or Crawler, is very loosely described by the author and it’s very much up to the interpretation of the reader to decide what it looks like. I was interested to see how that would play out visually in the film, but I understand it didn’t really fit in the narrative. Yes, it was an interesting choice by the author to kind of build this world, but be very abstract about everything. Sometimes to the point of “I really don’t know what he’s describing right now”. I couldn’t visualize everything, but I was more feeding off the vibe or tone of it. Personally, I liked the book but I understand its criticisms. What the fuck, this movie man.  oh thanks for mentioning that, i forgot about the bruise thing because they never directly addressed it again Basically just emphasizing everything got scrambled. Lena didn't leave the same person she entered as. It's also a tattoo of an Ouroboros. If you wanna Google that it makes sense thematically with the movie.  It almost made me feel like it could have been a creature from a higher dimension than our own sent forth on some sort of test flight. A vanguard canary with a terraforming device to see if our realm is habitable.  Check out Solaris! The book and the Tarkovsky movie. The idea of aliens so different from us that we don't even recognize them as such is an important theme in those. Arrival does that well too.  So I was confused at this point, she was trying to get out and that's why her clown was pushing against her, but at one point she pushed away from the door and the clone didn't. I couldn't tell if it was actually copying her or had a mind of its own.  Yeah looked like burn victim Natalie The transformation was so slow yet so fluid. The entire time I was watching I was thinking that they would cut away and then back and progress in between shots. It was really cool just to see it in one shot. One of the only times where digital face creation has actually had the desired effect since they WANTED it to be unnerving. Blade Runner and Dunkirk pushed the limits but idk how they got this past  You say that but the thing walks forward when she walks backwards.

Not to mention it knew she was walking and went to ground to begin mimicking again.

It's not a mirror it's a mimic  Apparently she joined it.  She may not have suddenly become one of the plant silhouettes, that's open to the viewer, but Lena lost track of her, and she was definitely mutating rapidly, and seemed to have made her peace with it. I -think- it meant that her DNA mutated and she carried the shimmer replication thing with her.  >the shimmer flicker in her eyes was just meant to be a lasting effect of being in it, right?

IMO yes. I've seen a lot of people here suggest the ending is some ""she was the copy & lying all along!' twist, but I don't think that's right considering how Kane's copy was confused with no memory before he became sick I fear for a BR2049-esque run  It’s not going to soon be on Netflix in the US The folk music too! [deleted] rip in peace. And enjoy watching Stalker (1979) That’s actually a very fitting quote to pull, considering the third act of this film had some distinctively Lynchian elements. I mean, drop the personified Shimmer into the trippier episodes of the newest Twin Peaks season and it would feel right at home. Great points! I think the film was strengthened by having no villain. It made it more disturbing that no one knew what was going on or why, they just knew something was happening and it was fucked up. I was incredibly stressed out watching parts of it  #   I had to listen to the soundtrack after leaving the movie. The track your talking about is specifically is called ""The Alien."" It's 12 min long and I can't even put into words what it does to me. You are correct. Neither of the women had the tattoo, it was the soldier's that Kane cuts open. You can see it when they look at his corpse in the pool. They were being changed by the Shimmer slowly throughout. Lena was actually Lena but Kane was alien Kane We are a part of a universe of destruction and creation. Nothing is static. Everything changes. It reminds me of the discussion Lena and Kane had about aging and God. He thinks God’s plan is intentional, she thinks God fucked up. But maybe God just is.

This is why she fights back against the creature, who I think in some ways is a stand-in for God. She has a purpose. She doesn’t want to be annihilated, though part of her is anyway.  It’s partly about man’s attempt to thwart the powers that be, the powers that destroy us, the fundamental nature of everything. We assume our importance because we are conscious of our existence. When we discover that we are just a temporary arrangement of fragments, do we give ourselves up to the infinite, or do we cling to ourselves?  I liked both... they're both too different to compare I don't know. That's how I interpreted it. Isn't that the point of the movie though? I definitely thought it was a different creature between the night attack and the tied up / chairs attack.  One was lithe and wolf-like, quick and decisive, the other was bearish and slow, unsure what to eat / attack. I think they painted a pretty clear picture on this one. The one who got attacked in the field was later seen with her throat (think vocal cords) removed.

Then the bear that came in while they were tied up was mimicking her voice. Seems obvious it's what attacked them at night.  I really thought the Shimmer just distorted time. A few days inside are weeks/months outside. That would explain the food situation. They were feeding using photosynthesis like plants. Light and life are tied together through the film imo. The shimmer (multiple colors of light), the womb like hole in the LIGHT house, phosphorus Grenade being bright, etc Based on it trying to eat a character, I imagine so. Wow. I haven’t even thought about it like that. It’s so interesting how this film validates so many different facets of the human experience.  I thought the movie was more Alex Garland addressing the question of identity. 

Ex Machina was all about what defines consciousness and at what point do we consider a being conscious. 

In Annihilation, we don’t know whether the two people at the end are actually Lena and Kane. We are led to believe that it is the “original” Lena, in that she wasn’t the alien copy, but we don’t know whether or not the surviving Kane is the original or the copy. But even if it is Copy Kane, why couldn’t he be considered to be the same? After all they have the same DNA at the point of duplication, and Copy Kane seems to have the same experiences. But most people would agree that it still isn’t Kane. 

I could definitely see your cancer theme though, this was just my interpretation.  I thought something similar. That it was using/adapted the vocal chords of its last victim to attract others. It made me a feel that the bear had a sinister quality to it. Definitely freaked me out. Didn’t Kane also mention that he didn’t know how he got home— he was just standing outside their bedroom and he saw Lena inside? 

Could be that it was their house after all? What's the meaning behind the tattoo?  you watch it in boise? Well the track ['The Alien'](https://youtu.be/j4H97m4UrGw) that follows it in the movie is pretty much that, an extended/adapted/inspired recreation of the Moderat track. Quite fitting considering the themes of the movie. Yeah, when I notice how believable an actor's reactions are in the moments between lines, especially in contrast to other actors in the same scene (when they found the intestine worm footage on the table is the moment I'm thinking of), I think they've got something special! Didn’t she kill it?  Let's leave our easily defensible high ground quarters to sit in a Shack with a light pointed at our faces.

Seems legit. I was wondering if maybe because of her cancer her cells were refracting or duplicating or whatever at an accelerated rate.   IIRC there was 4 pictures arranged by the stairs in the OG house, the middle picture being their wedding photo. In the Shimmer house only the wedding picture was copied, but it looked either dirty or blurry. Maybe Kane spent a lot of time in that house and it started to mutate based on his memories.   It is hinted at in the book. There is something out in the marshes that moans at night. Garland just decided to bring it out of the dark.  I need to find an audiobook if one exists. I want to see what the book is all about. I can't imagine much of anything being creepier than a mutated bear that makes the sound of dying screams of a female.  The movie works on multiple levels, and it's really great because of it.  You can take it as face value, an alien from a different dimension/reality changing the world by sheer force of its existence, or the cancer metaphor, or the self-destruction / rebuilding / change metaphor.  It's a really well-crafted film. Accurate enough. 

I mean, I'm good with ""this reminds me of a book...""

I'm less good with ""ugh. Did you steal this from a Natalie Portman movie?"" I‘ have my battles with self harm. When they said she always wore long sleeves, I kind of knew exactly how she felt. And then when she walked out in a shirt with her scars out, I was crying in the theatre because it was so beautiful. It was somehing I would never have the strength to do. She wanted to feel alive, and she got what she wanted

I really think self harm is never portrayed well in film. It is always a form of blood and harm, and never just a way of coping as it so often is. This movie handled it beautifully, and I wish we got more time with her character as well.  That may very well have been the loudest I have ever heard a theater get. It was amazing.  I lost my shit with the loud sound in the movie. I loved it. I wish more movies were loud. It seems like so many movies out there are so quiet.  It was kind of evocative of the weird caveman paranoia of sitting around a fire  Holy SHIT. This is why this movie is so good, little shit like this that when you think you know everything someone else mentions and you just now notice it. Not cable. Hannibal was on NBC.  [deleted] But what does that mean?  But I wanted *2 Anni 2 Hilation* It does answer some things and has a satisfying ending in my opinion. It has a better pace than the second book so if you’ve made it that far, it’s worth it to finish out the trilogy.

You will still have questions. But, I’m sure you’re expecting that. The author likes to leave things out there for us to chew on. I really wanted to see the ""Where lies strangling fruits"" words and was kinda disappointed that part was left out I thought it was another detail setting up the psychiatrist hypnotizing everyone like the 3 day memory loss in the beginning but that didn’t really come to play  It was mimicing her, mirroring her. Not trying to hurt hurt, unless she was trying to hurt it. When she went for the door, it went for the door, the more she pushed, the more it pushed back. 

It was only when she introduced the grenade that it didn't totally understand what it was mimicking. She placed it in it's hand, then pulled the pin calmly, it mimicked her and calmly engaged. She leap away and it didn't have a chance to mimic before the blast. 

It didn't yet have a mind of its own  it was still growing.  Like a toddler who is capying it's parents. That was my take away.  Dunkirk literally game me permanent tinnitus damage in my left ear. The submarine torpedo that hits the boat? My left is still ringing over 6 months later.

Thankfully I had my ear plugs for Blade Runner. I now have professional earplugs I wear at concerts and movies. Not because I want to, because I need to or the ringing gets bad for 3-4 days and hurts my sleep.  Fuck you Christopher Nolan. oh shit true, dunkirk might win actually. although i was on 70mm imax for that one.  I agree with that interpretation. Original Lena and Shimmer Kane, both with varying degrees of the alien DNA. If she was really a copy, why even mention the video with 2 Kanes or the copy of her to Wong? She could just say she found the source of the shimmer and burnt it down. Her and Kane were the only people aware of the existence of copies. If she wasn't the original Lena there'd be no reason to tell anyone about the copies. It’s wasn’t nearly as expensive as BR. That said the critic reception will help this to not be completely ignored. It’ll be really hard for it to make back the $40m it cost with it only releasing in 3 markets. Garland shouldn’t have trouble getting a job after going 2/2 with critics though.  Considering there were 15 people at my showing last night...I'm scared for this film. I don't think it's going to do well. This movie took years off my life. In the lighthouse scene after Ventress' disintegration, I thought that the Lena clone was raping Lena when she's up against the door. [deleted] I don't think so. All they said was that their minds melded with the bear as it killed them. And that one woman's throat was torn out. It was not at all clear to me that the bear was eating their voice boxes. In the book it's the other way round. Three years in Area X is two weeks outside.   Interesting interpretation. I had taken it as a sign that they were both survivors, changed from the ordeal, but nonetheless connected. It's a relationship I see amongst my family who are survivors, a relationship that seems altogether unique. 

I like your interpretation, too. The cancer analogy has caught me and hasn't let go, and admittedly that's because of my personal connection to the affliction. It's a sign of truly spectacular art that so many other interpretations are found here. Thanks for sharing yours! I may not remember correctly but didn't the ""copies"" have that infinity tattoo??    It also deals with that question, if our cells die and are replaced by new ones, are we still the same being as when we started life? Here it is taken to the extreme, where she is literally mutated and mutated, even if she wasn't literally replaced. Is she still the same person if all of her cells changed? Honestly I think it was just meant to be a kind of symbolic fluke that tied into the doubling/mutation theme, mostly because there was nothing particularly original about the design. If it had been some unique layout that just happened to be in Area X also then maybe you could read more into it (like some crazy balcony spiral staircase thing you don't see every day).

A lot of houses are built from similar floor plans, especially houses in developments. You'll go into a friend's place down the street and it's literally the same layout as yours but flipped. And people have oddly common ways of decorating their houses, pictures going up the stairs, etc. So the tattoo is Ouroboros, the snake endlessly eating it's own tail, shaped like an infinity symbol: Self-destruction ad infinitum. This plays into the ideas that the psychologist talks about, that people are self-destructive. 

Then you realize that the tattoo is spreading. It starts on arm of the guy in the pool and ""spreads"" to both the paramedic and to Lena. Showing that what is going on in Area X isn't just genetic. It's everything. Whoa this is weird. Just got back from this movie and my buddy said “What.....the....FUCK” loudly during the movie in Boise. I ate an edible and just got home from the showing a bit ago and this shit is tripping me out like I absorbed some of the movie and it’s showing up on reddit 18 days earlier WTF? I did! Or did it kill her? I think it's meant to be ambiguous.  Natalie Portman of all people should be aware of the value of the high ground. Not to mention, how much scarier would it have been to be attacked IN THE WATCH TOWER? Like, it’s a far more suspenseful location for that scene. 

The women awaken when Lena notices the fence torn open. They see something approaching, losing it in darkness. 

They feel the tower sway, hearing animal noises. 

Their guns drawn and aimed into ethereal dark. 

All four directions covered by one person. 

Then a SCREAM. Shepard is gone. 

They race down the stairs, attempting to follow what must be a bear dragging Shep into the forest. 

Until they lose her. 

Even in a FUCKING WATCH TOWER, they are not safe. 

Now *that* is a scene that would freak me out.  Also the character who was taken wasn’t even standing behind the little half wall, she was totally in the open.  Just a light on in general was a bad idea Except in the book it’s not even close to being a bear, as you find out in the last book of the series The Moaning Creature does attack the Biologist near the end and it's creepier than the Bear 😱 The entire trilogy is 1 audible credit. Or you can get each one is 1 credit each (whythough.jpg). 

The creature in the book is much creepier than the thing in the movie. ""no i read it from a fucking book look i have it here""

""oh well it's in a movie""

""I KNOW"" I took her finale as one of the most poignant of the movie. She had dealt with self harm her whole life, and she finally found a place where beauty and peace won out. She didn't kill herself, or harm herself, she gave herself over to something she viewed as greater and, more importantly, at peace. She became *apart* of something and born anew. I think she felt peace. It was beautiful even in its brevity. 

The flowers and leaves were literally growing from her scars and wounds. It was cinematically beautiful and breathtaking.  Same here . Outside of Dolby Atmos and IMAX , loudest for sure . Blade Runner and Dunkirk right behind it  because it was beyond our understanding, and not since the ancient days of crowding around the fire did we have the same lack of understanding and the fear it brought. IHMO the scariest possible thing is the concept of a predatory animal just outside visible range. It's our oldest and deepest fear because prior to agriculture it was probably the most common cause of death for humans. 

The poster for [It Comes At Night](http://www.joblo.com/movie-posters/2017/it-comes-at-night) did this perfectly
 It's the Shimmer's refraction combining everything into one. I'm not sure who had it first, my guess is the man on the wall.

The symbol itself though is the [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros), which is thematically significant.
 I thought it was a result of the refraction. IIRC we only see Lena with the tattoo after Anya dies Annihilation 3: Tokyo Rift Yeah, those were my favourite parts of the book; the mystery behind the lighthouse keeper and the tower. I think I approached the film with too many expectations from the book and it tainted my viewing of it.  Wasn't that what the psychologist was mumbling when lena went into the tunnel? It makes me wonder how much time Kane spent with his copy because his basically became a complete person. I don't think that it was ""learning and growing."" I think that it's not a thing that's capable of thought as we understand it. Any ""thoughts"" it had would just be fragments of the thoughts of whoever was near it or had entered the shimmer or something. It was a representation of what cancer is in the body. Cancer is not malicious or thoughtful. It just is. It's cells doing what they're programmed to do, but where that programming is flawed. I just realized that woman who said Lina just wants to fight earlier. She was fighting and it wasn't working, so she stopped fighting and that worked instead.  The $40m was paid out already by Netflix for international rights, so there's that at least. I was amazed that my theater was pretty much full for a “day before” release showing. Hopefully the marketing will do this movie some justice. She’s the original copy, essentially, but she’s been altered by the refracted nature of the shimmer than combines everything’s DNA inside.  I agree and I think half the reason the bear would tear out the throat is as the  minds meld you would eventually realize you were eating yourself and listening yourself scream so you'd tear out your own throat to silence it.  Then stop eating the rest of your body because well you're eating yourself.  Yup, it just tore it out. Still weird how it captured her dying moans. What about the skull? The tattoo was originally Gina Rodriguez's. She had it from the start. It somehow copied itself into Natalie Portman. I think it might've been put in just for effect on the viewer. The sense of familiarity and doubling/mirroring. The film went back and forth from the time period in the shimmer to before and after. It was almost disorienting because it got me thinking ""wait, are they somehow outside of it? Or in some parallel realm?"" Really just my impression/guess though -- could be something more, something less...or just not wanting to make another set lol (kidding) If I recall correctly ouroboros is a symbol of cyclicality, not self-destruction   He's going to every showing in Boise taking this line on tour  I personally believe the point of the end was that it IS the original Lena and at this point, Lena and her clone are one in the same. The shimmer changed her, and she is no different than her clone; she is part of whatever that thing was. The shot clearly showed that the original Lena left the weird metal copy in the lighthouse, you even see the metal body as it burns. That doesn't rule out some weird Freaky Friday shit though. I got the impression that the guard duty was not supposed to be down on the ground.  When she comes out of the tower's building, Natalie Portman looks around like she expects the doc to be up in the tower, but sees the lantern down at groundlevel, presumably so that the light wouldn't disturb the others.  (Doc's not taking guard duty very seriously).  Natalie goes down not looking to take over, just to chat.  They start talking but the bear breaks in.  Others wake up, see the two down at ground level and go to help.  Piss poor decisions and emergency response, but not a plan with an incredibly stupid setup.  That was my take on it anyway.  You'd think she'd be on top of things Except it wouldn’t work because they would watch the stairs and see the 800lb bear walking up them. They had to use the crazy person as an excuse to drag them out of the tower to make it plausible for one of them to get snatched up by a bear. Idk at least this is what I’m telling myself. I was also enraged when they left the watch tower haha. Even the very first (fourth) night they spent in the shimmer, they weren’t tented within line of sight. Like wtf? Also why did the memory loss thing never come back up? I was expecting that to be a major issue but it never came back around, or did I just miss that? Garland has been pretty clear he was adapting the first book as a standalone story with no intention of following the series (hence the ending), so it makes sense he'd want to throw some more weird shit in there. I haven't read that far. I have only read parts one and two. Starting three soon, though! I was going to read the book until I read it was a series just now I don't mind spoilers; what's the creature in the book? Before I realized you could get the entire trilogy for one credit, I wasted a credit and bought just the first book. I was pretty pissed when I realized my mistake. You forgot Interstellar rocket launch That bothered me a bit because tattoos obviously aren't genetic, and I was under the impression that the shimmer was refracting DNA. Maybe someone else can explain it to me. I'm watching the credits right now so this is very fresh.  IIRC I remember seeing the tattoo first on Lena, because I freaked out when I saw it on the dead body on the side of the pool. Then we see it on Anya in the scene where she goes crazy.  I was trying to make it out, and I hope it was He must have spent long enough with the mirror that it didn't need to mirror him anymore though I think, as we see when the mirror films original Kane, then steps to the left side of the camera so the audience can see him. He was in there for a year, but when he returns to Lena he says 4 months O.O It was wearing a different outfit so I feel like it had to be a different member of the crew, since Lena's copy had an identical uniform. The skull must be because it physically or genetically mixed with humans. I presume that all the humans were genetically part plant and animal by the end of the film. But it seems to be dependent on their emotional state. The black physicist who cut herself gave up and quickly turned into a plant. The psychiatrist and biologist resolutely pushed forward and seemed physically normal all the way up to the lighthouse.  Was it her's originally though? The body in the pool also had the tattoo. I don't remember seeing it on her before seeing it in the scene with the body, could be wrong though. It has a lot of variations (it's a very old symbol), most popular being the cyclical nature of life and death, infinity, and transformation. But there are other interpretations that include more of a focus on self-destruction (which is followed by rebirth), it is a snake eating its own tail after all. 

While I think all the ideas of Ourboros fit in the movie in some way, the fact that so much of the movie revolves around the idea of self-destruction it should follow that this interpretation of Ourboros focuses more on self-destruction too.  What we saw was the story she was telling Wong. That doesn't mean its the truth. Of course the copy is going to say the real Lena won the fight.
 Or the bear is capable of climbing the tower’s structure. It is, after all, mutated to the point of being an amalgam of other organisms. 

Edit: it really bothered me that the memory loss never came back into play too. I think that was a major error.  just because it's a series doesn't mean you can't read it The series felt story inconsistent to me, the first book was great and I couldn't put it down but the second was an absolute slog and just a chore to get through, really put a damper on my ability to enjoy the third.

FYI the first book is very different from this movie and it is a great read. It's a moaning mass of flesh that roams around the marshes outside of their camp site every night. All you hear at night is just moaning. She finds the trail of it and it looks like it's shedding the faces of people in the previous expedition. It hears her walking along the path in the marshes at night and starts chasing after her quick and fast. All she can see of the actual creature is the reeds parting where it is. You can return it on the site and buy the one you want! Go into your account purchases and you can select to return it.  I think it's meant to go beyond just DNA, that was just their attempt to rationally explain a phenomenon that was beyond any of them. It's refracting everything, remember the trees near the Lighthouse and how they look like they're made of crystal? Or how the fire seems to spread through everything. Or how Lena's house is somehow in there with them. [deleted] You have that wrong. Kane was there for a year. Lena was the one in there for 4 months.  I personally believe the point of the end was that it IS the original Lena and at this point, Lena and her clone are one in the same. The shimmer changed her, and she is no different than her clone; she is part of whatever that thing was. I understand she's an unreliable narrator, but consider this - if she's lying, why not simply leave out the existence of copies entirely? Her and Kane were the only people who knew of their existence. Holy shit; that's pretty intense. Thanks! It also seemed to refract Kane’s voice at the end. He had a typical American accent in the flashbacks but had a southern dialect in front of the camcorder. Possibly from another soldier that died? Wait when was Lena's house in there? I think I totally missed that.  I thought the trees were salt crystals growing like trees. The guy getting cut open definitely had the ouroboros tattoo on his arm. So maybe I missed something but how did Lena survive for four months inside the Shimmer? By all counts, it only took between 7-9 days to get to the lighthouse. So what happened during the remainder of the time?  When he comes back, doesn't he say it only felt like a couple months or something? I don't remember the exact words but I remember her saying that his recollection of how long he's been gone doesn't make sense. I don't think any of them were there for that long from their perspective. I mean we can see Lena being in the lighthouse in real time for less than an hour. It just probably some time dilation in the zone. >at this point, Lena and her clone are one in the same

This interpretation feels right to me.  I was struggling to make sense of her eyes doing the colorful shimmering in the last shot, but this makes sense, especially since they'd already established that her cells were changing when she looked at them under the microscope. And also, if she was just lying the whole movie I would think the movie is a piece of shit. That is the laziest and shittiest explanation there is. yo i noticed that too but i didn’t know if i was just tripping  The house they enter where the ScreamBear attacks them. It's the same house, down to the picture on the wall by the stairs Could be. I thought it was glass from the sand on the beach ""I don't know"" the shimmer refracts everything, not just DNA. its not impossible that it completely fucks up time, making 4 monthes on the outside only “seem” like a couple weeks. They go over that at the very beginning. The scientist tells her she was in for 4 months and she said it felt like days Yeah he basically has no memory cause he’s the alien clone all along. 

But overall. Kane was in the for a year in real time. Lena was in there for 4 months in real time.  Well Kane was in there for a year, while his clone was in there and alive for a couple months Oh wow how did I miss that. Incredible detail.  That's my guess too. There was a lot of overgrowth in the town that would have taken YEAAARRRSSS to have done. I attributed that to the shimmer fucking time up. ",0
7,"Everyone was good but damn Ariana Debose deserves an Oscar nod, she was phenomenal. Most people are commending Ariana Debose and Mike Faist and rightfully so, but it’s also worth mentioning that David Alvarez as Bernardo is also freakin incredible! He took a 10+ year hiatus from acting (he was a child actor on Broadway) and he came back with a BANG.

Also, if you’re interested in dance—his physique and his lead are freakin fantastic to witness The fact that they gave ‘Somewhere’ to Rita fucking Moreno… it was so incredibly moving!!! Anyone else really liked the Tonight song that played before the Rumble started?

It was 4 different versions sung by the characters that blend and combine into one.

That was fucking epic. It's called tonight quintet on the soundtrack. mike faist is a movie star in the making Did this fucking movie somehow find a way to make a glorified extra from the original the most interesting character? Chino Gang woot woot. Yep - that was good.  Some of the cinematography...wow!  The shots of Tony and Maria noticing each other for the first time at the dance will stick with me for a long time.

Ended up being that almost-40 year old man crying on his own in the cinema at the end.  Yay me! I liked it a lot. Everything that was in Spielberg's control works, and it really shows that this was a passion project.

My only problem with the film isn't really with the film, or even the stage play, but rather the fact it's a *Romeo and Juliet* story, which means the two central characters are by far the least interesting of the piece. Zegler's wonderful, Elgort's fine (less wooden than usual, I thought), they get good songs, and the meeting at the dance is great, but you're still stuck with a little bit of 'yeah, yeah, we get it; you're young and completely smitten with each other. More of the complex characters around you, please'. RIP to the one Puerto Rican that got absolutely fucking annihilated with the paint can. This is actually a movie about how Chino becomes the joker Also Riff is one John Mulaney looking MFer Was the ""I feel pretty"" song always after the rumble? Seemed a little out of place. I know they moved that ""keep it cool boy"", song earlier while riff was still around and that kinda made sense but idk about that pretty song lol The song Gee, officer krupke was fantastic. It was a great way to get to know some of the Jets with less screen time. Though America was the best in terms of visuals/choreography. “Let’s get some beers, some weed, and go to the zoo.” Well don’t mind if I go Anton. Shout out to Rita Moreno for killing it at almost 90 years old. I could not take my eyes off Ariana DeBose - the star of this in my opinion What I love about this movie is that it actually looks vintage.  I know they recreated sets and costumes but look of the cinematography feels like it was genuinely shot from that era.  Does anyone know what film stock they used?  Or was it just pure color grading filter?  How does Kaminski do it? FUN FACT: During the opening oner, a sign announces the construction of Lincoln Center, which is built on top of the filming locations for West Side Story ‘61. ITT: me realizing that there are people out there who don't know West Side Story is based on Romeo & Juliet That moment in the balcony scene in when the song slows down and Maria sings the slow line ""tonight, tonight the world is full of light"" looking through the stairs (the part from the trailer) was pure ear frisson “Hey, so you know that guy who followed me behind the bleachers at the big dance?”

“Yeah, he was cute!”

“Yeah so last night he followed me home and then today he killed my brother”

“Wait wtf? Did you contact the authorities?”

“Well, not exactly-“ This movie was exceptional. Also, Corey Stoll looks (different?) with hair. Did anyone else see Dean Cain in the actor who played Chino? For real, anytime he took off his glasses it was like seeing Clark Kent turn into superman Good movie. Ending was messed up. Never saw the original, did it end the same way? I'd never seen the original film and had zero familiarity with the musical going into this. It might just be my favorite film of the year (between this and Belfast), and I'm strongly considering going back a second time

I know it's a cliched saying and all that, but this truly was movie magic at its finest Very few times is my cynical ass overwhelmed with emotion at a movie. But that sequence with them on the fire escape culminating in that kiss. 

Magic caught on camera. Does anyone else felt like they could of gone for another actor for tony?’ I felt like ansiel elgort was inconsistent.. I can’t put my finger on it?! Anyway Rachel Ziegler is a star in a making! Ariana debose made a passionate   Anita ! The supporting cast was exceptional! This movie is the first movie in a long time that I’ve seen twice. Fun “small world” anecdote:

David Alvarez (Bernardo) won a Tony for Billy Elliot in 2009, where one of his co-nominees was Brian d’Arcy James (Officer Krupke). 

Brian d’Arcy James was nominated for his performance as Shrek for Shrek the Musical. 

Rachel Zegler was performing in her senior year musical of Shrek the Musical when she got the role of Maria. You can see this is a passion project for him and it comes out in every shot.

Absolutely gorgeous cinematography and top tier music, choreography and acting. In many ways this is better than the original. It feels so much more alive with an actual feel of the city and of course latinos playing the parts of The Sharks.

The only thing that bothered me a little bit is how Maria basically didn't react at all to her brother dying and just brushed it away so quickly. 

Also about the Spanish subtitles controversy. Do not worry! Nothing said in Spanish is important to the plot and a lot of stuff they say in Spanish they immediately say it in English next. Plus Anita tells her family to speak English at all times to practice I liked how the film let Rita Moreno call the Jets out for nasty racist pieces of work they are. They're not lovable and Spielberg made that clear. West Side Story looms large in the cannon of classical Hollywood films and it seems too taboo for any filmmaker to consider remaking it. And yet Steven Spielberg’s hands us a remake that not only improves upon the original in terms of pure craft and spectacle. But also re-examines the plot and it’s story beats in way that perfectly re-contextualizes  it for a modern audience. Which could not be done without Tony Kushner’s help who writes with such deep knowledge and empathy for his characters, which provides levity to what is ultimately a melodrama. One sequence that stood out to me was Tony’s ‘Maria’ which not only has fun with his head-over-heels romanticism but also subtly highlights his own privileges. 

I wanna acknowledge Janusz Kamiński who does an excellent job matching the energy of the original’s frenetic camera movements. While also being able to light and frame scenes with such a clear vision that makes the movie feel like a living piece of art. 

It’s also thanks to Adam Stockhausen whose incredible production design who finds great balance between delivering us a New York that’s in decay but somehow brimming to life with color and character. A favorite set price of mines being the salt flats where the rumble takes place at the end of the first act. 

The cast is fucking stellar and there’s no real weak link in my opinion. Some stand outs include Mike Faist as Riff whose choices add great danger and sadness to the character. The build up to the rumble almost feels like a spiral in a sense. Also Ariana DeBose kills it as Anita who walks the full spectrum of human emotion and makes it look so easy. I want to shout out Rita Moreno as Valentina whose reimagining of Doc is okay with such quite restraint that she can command attention with the faintest of movement. Her version of somewhere is absolutely heartbreaking and the age and experience she brings to it deepens the song’s emotional core. 

If La La Land wasn’t enough to convince people that musicals deserve a place in film than West Side Story will prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. As much of a drag as it was to wait for this movie (rightfully so) I’m glad I was able to experience it in theaters. I never knew the anything about West Side Story at all but was very thrown off that Maria didn’t care very much that Tony killed her brother. I am still in tears from this movie. I genuinely thought it was absolutely incredible. Definitely my new favourite movie musical, for sure. I had no complaints about Any of it. Loved every scene, loved every actor, loved every dance. I was moved to tears several times by just how emotional it made me feel, whether that was elated or sad, nervous or excited. The dancing was a true highlight, the music, the costumes, everything. Not a single bad word to say and I will go back to see it again in the next few days, and it will be my first DVD purchase in a long time as soon as it comes out. Wow. This is the Best Picture winner of 2021 imo. Felt like I was transported to the 50’s watching this film, truly a very unique and memorable experience. I really, really, enjoyed this film. The single shot that has stuck with me occurs right after Riff gets stabbed. The camera holds on both him and Tony for a beat and then pans back out to Bernardo sobbing. For all of their posturing, it really just is a bunch of boys fighting over their slice of the playground. 

What a great moment from David Alvarez and Mike Faist! They kept mentioning Ansel just getting out of jail multiple times. So it's the sequel to Baby Driver, right? /s This movie proves the need to cast a majority of the cast with Broadway folks. Wicked, take note.

Aside from that, I found every alteration to be just. The entire film was a wonderful movie musical from start to finish, with each scene highlighting the purpose of its place in the plot.

I’m also struck by the interactions between Valentina and Anita. To have Rita Moreno hear the words she spoke decades ago, and then be the one to replay them for Tony. Wow. That really hit me as a fan of this musical and its original movie. As a Latino, I liked that they Puerto Ricans were given more time and depth, and the absence of brownface. I also liked that they incorporated what happened to San Juan Hill into the story. Solid flick, but man does Ansel Elgort look like a serial killer 

There’s nothing behind those eyes Welp, here comes another Best Picture and Best Director nomination for Steven Spielberg. Hey, I just met you,  
And this is crazy,  
You killed my brother,  
Now let’s get naked. How come noone talks about the implied sex scene between Tony and Maria right after Tony murdered Maria's brother...and she knew Friday: Maria meets the love of her life. 
Saturday: Maria’s brother is killed by the same love of her life. She also loses her virginity (right?) to him later that night after finding out about said murder. 
Also Saturday night: Maria’s love is killed. 

Hell of a 2 days 
(I said Friday cuz like I assume a dance would be on a weekend. Idk. Idk what social outings are anymore) Señor Spielbergo does it again!

This reminded me of Gerwig's *Little Women* insofar as it's an adaptation that is clearly in dialogue not just with previous versions of the musical but also all the cultural conversation and critical analysis of those earlier versions. Now, it doesn't do the sort of radical meta-incorporation and structural revision that Gerwig does, but it's a very literate adaptation nonetheless.

Also, while most of the attention will (for obvious reasons) be paid to the meatier ways that Kushner has reworked the script, I was greatly amused that he bothered to incorporate a response/acknowledgement of the longstanding joke people made about Tony running through a Puerto Rican neighborhood crying out ""Maria!"" and only having one woman answer.

They also revise a few of the soliloquy numbers (both of Tony's solos) to have more stuff actually happen during them, which greatly improves the cinematic quality. I especially liked ""I just kissed a girl named Maria!"" being directed at a passing janitor.

I'd say this is an improvement on previous versions of this in pretty much all areas. Spielberg does so much more with the camera than Robert Wise ever could (or, in fairness to him, had at his disposal given the technologies of the time), the acting is more to modern tastes and I would say is just stronger across the board, and the extensive revisions Kushner made to the book of the musical add way more to the characters.

There was a teenage girl in the screening I was at who delightedly exclaimed ""Maddie!"" when Ms. Ziegler came into focus during the big gathering at Doc's (I guess she must not have noticed her during the ""Dance at the Gym"" sequence). Spielberg did it better. I prefer the story beats in this than the 1961 one. Just viewed it. Entered the theatre with some serious skepticism about a remake, but was blown away.

The NYC sets, cinematography, sound, vocal performances and acting were all top-notch. All the actors were excellent, but Ariana Debose as Anita and Mike Faist as Riff really stole the show for me. The actors for Tony and Maria clearly had good chemistry; their singing was stellar. Did not mind Elgort's bland face once he started singing. And Rita Moreno's song was remarkably moving. The overall direction was perfect, as were changes to the book. Found myself moved to tears multiple times.

The choreography was amazing; much more a part of the ongoing action as opposed to the more set-piece, theatrical sequences in the original. Was surprised by my experience. This film is magnificent; I love the original but this was arguably better. Holy shit. This movie is so damn well shot and directed I feel like Spielberg was born to direct musicals. This was incredible. Two years ago, right before the pandemic hit big, there was a brief revival of West Side Story on Broadway (before it was forced to shut down). It even featured a few of the same faces that are in this movie. From a technical standpoint it was great: There was a big LED backdrop that showed a bunch of video vignettes and had a small, retractable wall one one side that served as Doc's shop. There were some even points where a cameraman filmed the actors on stage with a Steadicam.  
  
Everything else about that revival was fucking awful.  
  
It was squeezed down to a one-act, 1hr 45min version which deleted a bunch of ""unnecessary"" elements including I Feel Pretty (which is debatably the most famous song in the entire goddamn show). They modernized the setting to present day, but still kept in the all the 50's slang like ""daddy-o"", which just felt distracting. They also tried to do the Hamilton thing by having a racially-diverse ""progressive"" cast, but that meant people of all colors were cast as both Jets AND Sharks, so the audience couldn't tell who was who. 

The whole thing felt like that one recurring SNL skit where the drama kids put on their own show and try to make profound messages about society, but they all just sound like a bunch of pretentious idiots (Think r/im14andthisisdeep ). I thought that shitty Broadway revival was basically how this remake was gonna turn out. Thank God it wasn't.

I actually think this was better than the 1961 film. The tipping point for me ended up being Rita Moreno's rendition of ""Somewhere"". Emotional and fragile; and a stark contrast from the rest of the songs up to that point, which were pretty much big and boisterous.

  
Also, in hindsight, I'm SO happy that Spielberg didn't do the obligatory musical-adaptation ""Oscar-Bait"" crap, AKA when they insert a brand new song into a classic musical just so they can snag an easy ""Best Original Song"" nomination when the Oscars roll around. It's so fucking unnecessary. The older songs are fine enough! Saw this over the weekend and just can't stop thinking about it! One thing I really loved was how impressionable Riff was to the Jets. I think removing him from the Officer Krupke number gave the other Jets some time to get some backstory, but also showed that Riff isn't necessarily ""psychologically disturbed"" like the rest of them. 

The rape scene again showed us that with out Riff they really are kind of a pack of mindless hyenas because I think had Riff been there, Anita wouldn't have been in that situation. I think they did a great job with Riffs character in this and really made him feel like a very tragic character that clearly was very influential to a often cruel group of guys. He truly gave them purpose. I went back to watch a second  time and it was mostly to watch Mike Faist dance. He's really phenomenal.  Especially since he lost 20 lb for the role that he didn't have as ""extra"" in the first place.  (His call, he wanted to look poor as hell).

Things I figured out the second time:

In their faux-marriage song, Tony sings ""Even death won't part us now"" and Maria sings ""Only death can part us now"". Ouch.

Tony's a fairly complex character and he's fleshed out a lot in this version,  but Maria is too in a way.  She's not just  a frustrated teenager who wants independence, she's also a horny young woman who sees her brother having fun while setting HER up with a square.The romance never really made ANY sense in the old  movie to me, and this one, I get it. Kinda.  It's over the top, but it's much better than the old one in terms of that relationship.

When Tony walks into the dance he enthusiastically greets Anybodys (the trans character) with a bro hug.  Nice character moment.

Officer Krupke doesn't really do anything bad, while the detective is a real POS. I feel like Spielberg has been putting out solid 6-7/10 movies for the last 15 years or so, so it's hugely refreshing to see a film he clearly has a ton of passion for.

The camerawork and lighting were fucking amazing. The shot of the gangs' shadows intersecting before the rumble was \*so\* good. Really enjoyed the film but Ansel Elgort really feels miscast to me. He doesn't have that much on-screen charisma. He can act sad and angry but there's no charm or excitement displayed during any of the romantic scenes. Surprised by how much Spanish I know Wildly unpopular opinion here but I really liked Ansel’s performance in this film. He has a great voice and usually does really good on the big screen. Having not heard about anything going on with him in the tabloids  before googling the movie, I would’ve given him an 8/10 easy So I'm in my mid thirties and I have never watched West Side story before. I've heard 1 or 2 songs before but I've never known the story details. So I went in with almost entirely fresh eyes.

The movie was beautifully shot. Visually it was stunning. I was really liking the story UNTIL Tony killed Bernado. I get why he did it (anger after killing his friend, wanted to retaliate) so that part of the story doesn't bother me. Its Maria forgiving him the same night and then sleeping with him literally hours after her brother died. From this point onwards I didn't like one character from the movie. The “no subtitles thing” is a non-issue.  And if you don’t speak Spanish it’s actually pretty immersive. Wow! This not only better than the previous adaption, but structurally superior to the original too. It just feels so alive. The entire of supporting cast is knocking it out of the park with so much personality and life. The main leads do a solid job holding up the love story, which admittingly was the weakest part of the original show. 

This is the best film musical I've seen in a long time. The choreography isn't chopped up in editing while the framing is focused on the right people when they sing. 

The lighting began to bug me, because I had close encounters and ET vibes where I was expecting aliens to land any second. 

I might go see this again, but man musicals are really long sometimes. Has anyone been out to watch it yet? In either “xtreme”  or regular? 
Hoping to go and watch the late show tonight but wanted to know if the xtreme was worth it!

Edit:: thanks for the tips guys! 109% recommend it in whatever upgraded format you have available. It made the experience more thrilling and intense! Totally worth it! Though it was very nice (and cute?) for Tony to learn how to speak cute and nice things in Spanish to Maria, it would have been nice to have had had him actually know a bit of Spanish seeing as he’s been working for Valentina for a year? Like to see him step in and try to defuse part of the rumble with some Spanish to Bernardo could have helped. I've honestly never understood why viewers hold it against Tony that he kills Bernardo. He didn't do it in cold blood. It's the same as not understanding why Harry immediately tried to kill Bellatrix after witnessing her kill Sirius Black.

Not only did Bernardo coldly stick his knife forward that resulted in the death of Tony's best friend, but he actually aimed to kill Tony. He went to the rumble with the aim to kill his sister's true love. And THIS is the same man you're all feeling sorry for? Like, WHY? Is it just because you feel sorry for Anita? Well I'm sorry but it has to be said: Bernardo is not the great guy some of you make him out to be.

Remember in the 1961 rumble scene when he deliberately provoked and made fun of Tony because Tony wouldn't fight him? Bernardo takes pleasure in mocking Tony's attempts to be good. He knows that Tony loves his sister, and he selfishly tries to ruin it because of the childish war between him and the other Jets. Ultimately, he's no better than the Jets because of how he tries to destroy Maria's happiness.

The prejudices come from both sides. The Sharks call the Jets ""gringos"" and ""Polacks"" (yes, it IS possible to be racist against White men, who in this story are of Irish, Italian and Polish descent). I'm not denying the Jets go too far in their actions against the Sharks (and eventually Anita), but Bernardo doesn't exactly try to stop the violent situation from escalating, either. Anita often tries to persuade him to live peacefully in America and her words fall on deaf ears. Both Bernardo and Riff think they know what's best for everyone, and that's why things take a turn for the worst.

If you're going to hold it against Maria that she sleeps with Tony then be my guest, but you should be using the reason that they've basically just met each other the night before and she's very naive in the whole idea of what love means. Yes, Tony killed her brother. And why did he do that?? Because he witnessed her brother killing his best friend. Let's stop kidding ourselves and stop pretending that Tony is an awful person for doing what most people would at least consider doing when they see their brother figure get knifed to death. Anyone happen to have a screen grab of that gorgeous shot of Tony standing in the puddles and the reflection of the lights?
I believe it was during the performance of “Maria”. I had to let out a silent ""holy shit"" in the middle of this adaptation. The movie completely blew away my expectations. Spielberg delivered one of the best movies of his career and; frankly, possibly one of the best musicals ever, at least in recent memory. It deserves all the nominations and awards It's inevitably going to get. Definitely tied for my favorite film of the year alongside Dune, so far. 

Also, as a bilingual Latino I really appreciated the lack of subtitles. It definitely added some extra emotional weight to the Spanish and Spanglish dialogue. Especially towards the end of the film. Spielberg's decision treated both cultures with equal appreciation and respect. At least to me, it made a positive impression. Welp this is one of my favorite movies of all-time. First of all, I loved how the griminess of the city contrasted with the whimsical musical aspects. My biggest worry was alleviated within three seconds of Ansel Elgort first opening his mouth to sing, and of course Zegler is a once-in-a-generation talent. Ariana DeBose really stands out with only a small amount of screentime also. Also what’s this? Elgort can actually act? Who knew?! He sold THAT >!realization, that ended up being false,!< scene brilliantly, and really had a captivating screen-presence, especially in his scenes when he isn’t being overshadowed by a much greater screen-presence.

As for Spielberg’s direction, he feels so *confident* in this. Literally every frame feels like it’s bursting with so much purpose and meaning (much credit goes to Janusz Kaminski here as well). Despite the long runtime, there are no wasted scenes, no sections that drag or feel unimportant to the central conflict. On the contrary though, nothing feels rushed. Every main character is properly fleshed out, with their own motivations that make me care about all of them, not just Tony and Maria. Lastly, I really appreciated that the musical numbers never felt cheesy, or even worse, wooden and joyless, which they often do with lesser filmmakers. For me it’s Spielberg’s most assured effort at least since *Munich*, maybe even *Saving Private Ryan*.

So far this is my choice for Best Picture and Director, as well as Rachel Zegler for Best Actress, and a nomination for Cinematography (still prefer Dune for that one, but only slightly.) and noms for all the below-the-line catagories. Spielberg has managed to do the impossible and make a definitively better version of an all-time classic.

Edit: **Also, if you are worried about there not being subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, allow me to alleviate your fears. Nothing that is said in Spanish is important to the plot, and Maria’s family is trying to get in the habit of speaking English predominantly, so a lot of things are said in Spanish and then actually repeated in English.** Also due to the strength of Zegler’s acting and Spielberg’s direction, so much is communicated non-verbally that you get the jist of what’s being said anyways. A big gripe I had with the original was the hamminess and intrusiveness of the Puerto Rican accent. In this movie, not only did they fix that with the occasional lapse into Spanish, but they made it seem much more authentic, like these were people who had just moved to America in the last couple of months. Y'know, I came into this movie with low expectations because I loved the original and saw no need for a remake (other than money)
But when the snapping started a smile grew on my face and by the time the choreography for 'cool' started (best scene imo), I have to admit this version is superior in some ways to the original. Spectacular film, and easily Spielberg's best in decades. My god this movie was so beautiful. I was a puddle for most of the run. My only complaint is “Cool” one of my favorite music theatre numbers. The gun thing was way too on the nose for me. “Got a rocket on your pocket” is not about a gun! Otherwise I loved it! My favourite scene is at the end when Rita Moreno throws up a hail Mary for Ansel Elgort and was like oh well lool I just saw the original West Side Story last year, so I don’t really have any nostalgic attachments to it. 

With that perspective, I thought this was just as good and at some points better. I cried at the end. One of the best movies I’ve seen in a long time. 

The way they incorporated Rita Moreno was done beautifully as well. Just saw it. Amazing direction, amazing choreography, amazing acting, amazing everything...

except, ""Somewhere"" should be sung by Tony and Maria. I know that in the stage production it's not and yes sung by Valentina it means something slightly different but still meaningful, but it's probably the saddest love song I've heard in my life so I really wanted to hear it from our doomed lovers. On of my favorite things about this movie is that it’s shot like a movie and not a musical. Really makes it stand out and unique Great movie but Ansel’s face when he is told of Maria’s death was unintentionally hilarious. I have nothing negative to say about this movie. I was sucked into every scene and I felt a sense of happiness from start to finish. Steven Spielberg did a phenomenal job with directing this movie and you can tell that extra care was given to each shot of every scene of the movie. Best film of 2021 until my most anticipated film of this year being Spider-Man: No Way Home. This was the most homoerotic Spielberg could have made this and it was amazing In no way or world is the original better than this. Literally everything is improved in Spielberg’s version, from the music, to the visuals, to the performances, to the story, to the characters actually feeling like people. It actually feels like it takes place in a city rather than an abandoned ghost town, musical numbers like America feel infinitely better because of this as well, with the characters singing about life in America while… and I know, it’s crazy, **going through America**.

The complaints and comments on here from *before* the film released about how awful it was that the Spanish wasn’t subtitled was nuts with me not being a Spanish speaker and not feeling like I missed anything aside from a couple jokes that were probably meant for actual Spanish speakers. No important plot points were spoken solely in Spanish, as anytime something crucial was said, it was then spoken in English right after. Seriously dumb as fuck that there are people that are so upset by this decision before even seeing the movie.

Chino, Tony, and Maria all feel like they actually have dimensions to their humanity, with Chino literally being a background character in the original with maybe one line of dialogue, if that, Maria being nothing more than a pretty face, and Tony just being “out of the Jets”, with Maria now having an actual personality and Tony having a backstory.

This was phenomenal and has a very good shot (as it should) at cleaning house during award season. Spielberg did his shit with this.

If Disney ever decides to do something with the Roger Rabbit property, give me Mike Faist AKA Riff, as the lead Weasel. And also, it’s been said plenty already, but Rachel Zegler is a STAR.

Edit: Just wanted to add a link in to my actual full review on my blog. If you happen to be interested, you can check it out [at this link, here!](https://notveryprofoundfilm.medium.com/movie-review-steven-spielbergs-west-side-story-d65fbab67479) The entire cast, apart from Ansel, is great, but Ariana Debose is phenomenal. Moving the “I feel pretty” song from day to night was a clever in-story way to not include the word “gay” in the song. **“Wow!”** is all I can say. This was a pretty good reimagining of the original musical!  I loved the cast, historical accuracy to the sad reality of urban renewal and  making of New York’s Lincoln Square neighborhood, I love that there is more backstory to the characters, set design is stellar and the music is so good! I place this together with the 60s version . I recommend watching this film!

 I loved Rachel and Ansel’s performance but I also loved the minor and side characters like Rita, Bernardo, and Riff. Just finished watching this film. Thank god I was the only one in the theater because I was crying like a baby it was almost embarrassing. The movie made me very emotional and even though I knew what was going to happen since I’m familiar with the source material, I was still at awe at how wonderful the film was. Very well-done. Probably better then the original and that’s saying something when I loved the original a lot.

Just the overall feel of the dancing and contrast is so much more alive and every song has a bit more meaning behind it. It sucks that I was in front of three awful moviegoers who couldn’t shut the fuck up and laugh at the ending. 

I think that just speaks more to how much more I love this film. Great stuff and Spielberg just feels at the top of his game here.

10/10. I adored it. The film is a visual feast, the cast is terrific (the supporting players are on a league of their own), and the adaptation is mostly successful in updating the original’s themes, but something really bothered me in the second act. I can buy the “love at first sight”, tragic young lovers story, but the fact that they still staged every post-war event in the space of a single night drained the emotional impact of the deaths. I can buy that Maria fell in love with Tony at first sight; I can’t buy that she would be in the mood to have sex with him merely moments after learning of her brother’s death, or that Tony would get over the fact he’d just committed homicide (which is his entire emotional arc throughout the film) immediately after. This is something the adaptation could have handled better (even something minor, like all of this happening the following night, would help) instead of just going with the original script. With all the talk about and awards nominations for the ladies, I was surprised how good the male actors were when I saw it tonight. Ansel was perfect as the reformed thug who had his heart in the right place but couldn't escape the ghosts of his past. And his singing was just as fantastic and accomplished as Rachel Zegler's. I definitely felt a strong romantic chemistry between them. Knowing the ending already just made their scenes more poignant.

The casting of Mike Faist was ridiculously good. Obviously he looked the part as well as anyone else did here. I think he actually did the best acting in the movie as far as dialogue scenes go. This role could easily turn into a mustache-twirling thug, but he showed subtlety and depth that made you feel there was an unspoken history there that led him down the wrong path.

The music and dancing were really remarkable throughout the film. All the classic songs were done to full justice here. The new choreography for Officer Krupke was a real highlight I think. I love how much dynamic action they made happen on that small set. My car ride home zipped by so much faster than the ride to the theater, with all the music and energy of the film still reverberating in my head.

I'm not ready to say it was better than the original. I'd have to watch that one again. It's been decades. I don't think it's going to get Best Picture, because the fact that it's a remake is basically going to disqualify it. Spielberg may have a chance at director, and it should get some technical awards. But I think its most likely award is going to be Rachel Zegler. The movie isn't really being nominated for music because it's not original, but honoring her will be symbolic of honoring the musical accomplishment. Oscar has a history of giving awards to young actresses in a debut or breakthrough role. It doesn't hurt that it looks like she'll be the only non-white actress nominated, given the increased focus on racial diversity in awards. And seeing her give her speech will be like the culmination of a Cinderella story. That idea will be hard to resist for the voters. I think Ansel played the scene where he finds out Maria is “dead” a *little* too broad but it felt believable to me and I’m glad to see others here on his side with regards to it One of the most magical moviegoing experiences I've had all year. I hope Steven Spielberg lives long enough to do a dozen musicals. Rachel Zegler is magnificent. As someone who isn’t a huge fan of this sort of story, I thought this film was beautifully made. I absolutely loved the camera work. To quote Scott Nye: ""WEST SIDE STORY - Steven Spielberg is quite simply operating at a level few even know is there, let alone consider, let alone attempt, and forget altogether about achieving. I want to see this five hundred times"" Man, Spielberg has been holding that one in since Raiders clearly. I felt it.

Also, was that an actual Jaws reference in the beginning? Literal sharks trying to reach up onto the fence with that little musical cue. If so, 10/10 Late but: during the rumble, when Bernardo and Riff were squaring off, did it seem like they didn't really want to hurt each other at that point? They were kind of half-heartedly swiping at each other, and then >!Tony basically pushes Riff into Bernardo's knife. Bernardo looks stricken after that and doesn't try to defend himself when Tony lunges at him. I mean his beef was mainly with Tony, I don't think he wanted to kill anyone.!<

It seemed like it was just supposed to be this macho posturing that escalated into tragedy, for both of them. Maybe that was the point? I haven't seen the original in years so I don't remember how it played out there. I had never seen West Side Story before nor really knew much about the story and went in blind, but I guess this one just wasn't for me. I get the whole Romeo and Juliet motif with young, dumb love set in New York City with racial tensions, but I was just out after her brother got murdered. I kind of rolled with it until then and mostly suspended my disbelief but I couldn't get over how she had a reaction for about 12 seconds before moving on with her life. And then follows it up by sleeping with the same guy hours later and then having the gall to make excuses about how much she loves him to Anita who just came back from identifying Bernardo's body. Word? This guy you met two nights ago with the charisma of a dead fish who just killed your brother?  How are you going to be singing about true love and all this garbage to a woman who just had her lover murdered, your brother, and is rightfully distraught? I just checked out after that. 

Aside from storyline issues that were just going to be endemic to a retelling of this story, I just could not get over how bad a casting job they did with Ansel Elgort as the lead. Other actors and actresses on this production could really sing and dance their asses off and were electric in scenes (Bernardo, Riff, and Anita especially) while this guy was really flat and had nearly negative charisma in most scenes. It felt kind of like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables for me. I just did not buy him as a Romeo equivalent at all, could not understand why she'd fall head over heels in love with THIS guy in specific, and just felt like he couldn't emote effectively at all. He was basically as flat as a thumb to me, I do not understand the appeal at all. I think this could have been much elevated with a better leading man, but Elgort just wasn't it at all. Horrible casting choice. 

Beautifully shot and mostly well acted (aside from Elgort), but you definitely felt that it was 2.5 hours long with how much it dragged on. And I'm a person that tends to like musicals but ultimately I just don't think this story was all that great, it was a bit too sappy for me, and the characters of Tony and Maria just took me out of it. And before anyone jump in with ""well it's Romeo and Juliet!"" I've always felt that R&J, compared to his other works, is one of the weaker stories penned by Shakespeare. And to carry a weak story in a high budget adaptation like this you need a dynamite cast and cannot flub your male lead. I'd give this like a 4/10. Sweeties if you have a problem with Maria and Tony’s love story please take it up with William Shakespeare. Also if she didn’t sleep with Tony we wouldn’t have gotten “A Boy Like That” we gotta make some sacrifices okay? God damn, the movie is vibrant and full of energy. Everything just pops off the screen and you can totally feel the love and passion behind this from everyone involved. 

I remember when this was first announced and the consensus was “Why?” but Spielberg outdid the original and this was just a delight. Love the movie! Choreography and cinematography were great. In fact the movie is so good that it really points out a lot of the flaws in Romeo And Juliet (from a modern moviegoer perspective) 

Too much lens flare and Tony as a character were the biggest gripes for me. Movie is straight up winning the best picture at the Oscars It really wouldn’t have surprised me if Spielberg was like, “yeah so I bought an island and just built Manhattan.” Haven't gotten to see the movie yet (waiting for booster) but I've listened addictively to the 2021 soundtrack and I've seen the '61 version numerous times.

The most stunning lyric line to me is in the ""Tonight Quintet"":

JETS: Well, they began it.

SHARKS: Well, they began it.

That to me is the big tragedy right there. Because the real ""they"" is the society that's thrown them all out/forgotten them all. Not each other. Loved this, and as someone who didn’t know much of the story going in I was NOT expecting how dark it was and now I’m in a funk 🤣🙈. Ansel gives a great performance and is a great singer and the whole cast as a whole is amazing Last week I saw ""West Side Story 60th Anniversary"" so that I would be able compare it to Spielberg's movie.  The original movie was an adaptation of a play.  Spielberg took the adaptation and gave the players empathy. Holy shit Chino is down BAD. Imagine the girl you like completely forgets about you for some guy she knows nobody will approve of. This guy then kills her BROTHER and she STILL CHOOSES TO BE WITH HIM INSTEAD OF YOU.

Justice for Chino. I’m absolutely blown away. I’ve long considered West Side Story to be the greatest movie musical ever made and seeing a remake not only do the original justice but make *improvements* is not something I thought I’d see. Spielberg is an animal and I don’t know why I had any inhibitions about him taking the wheel with this. He knocked it far out of the park. 

This film walked the perfect line between being traditional and doing its own thing. The sets, the lighting, the choreo, the staging, everything, it all feels so classic yet entirely modern. Though I could have done without the 7325 lens flares in every shot, the cinematography for the most part had me in awe. There’s something so much more dimensional about this movie that feels a lot more visceral. The fighting is real and punchy, the sets are dark and gritty, and the dialogue is genuine and sincere. 

The casting director needs a huge bonus because everyone except Ansel was perfectly cast. So well, in fact, thst Ansel sticks out like a sore thumb not being able to keep up. Rachel Zegler knocked my socks off and Mike Faist brought to Riff the perfect amount of toughness with just a dash of boylike charm. Ariana DeBose stole the show for me; having only seen her as ensemble in Hamilton I had *no* idea she had the kind of acting and singing and dancing chops she has. Casting her was one of the best decisions they could have made for this movie. 

Also, I was super pleased to see a Newsie among the Jets! Ben Cook was always one of my favorite actors to watch in the filmed version of Newsies so I’m glad he got a semi prominent role as a Jet! 

Overall, this is an amazing return to form for movie musicals. 2021 has been a great year for musicals in general with Broadway reopening and so many great movies (In the Heights, Tick Tick Boom) coming out, and I think it’s nice to see a movie that bookends it all with classic bravado. 

I rate it a 9/10. I’d give this a 10/10 if it wasn’t for Ansel. (Sexual assault allegations notwithstanding)

Also: if you’re looking for a video essay about why the original is so incredibly well regarded, [this video](https://youtu.be/aQlgiO29QT4) by Sideways goes into amazing detail. I thought the movie was very well done. I was surprised to see this thing had a $100 million budget, though. I wonder how easy their path to profitability is gonna be with that in mind. I think my favorite change was making Cool a Riff-and-Tony song, and ""got a rocket in your pocket"" go from a metaphor for anger into a metaphor for a gun.

My favorite NON change was having Anybodys be essentially unchanged. Expect before she was a tomboy, and now he is trans.  Character, function in the plot, dialogue all basically the same. What changed is the audience. Am I the only weirdo wishing more superheroe movies could at least try to look like this? This movie is incredible. I knew I would be amazed by Spielberg’s direction but I didn’t expect it to go to the lengths where I would actually be intensely involved on an emotional level. It’s hard to really sell a Romeo and Juliet love story in this day where everyone knows it, but by making everyone in this a fully drawn character (even Chino has a complex arc!), it just makes the pure elemental nature of Tony and Maria’s tragic love that much more intense. When Tony gets shot, I actually felt my heart break for Maria. That’s nothing short of a small miracle in these days where Hollywood movies feel the need to layer so much ironic humor instead of reveling in the emotion of story. It is miles better than the 1961 original, and it is one of Spielberg’s best films in years. I really like chino and the one girl who tried to be the underdog of the sharks and jets. They were simply trying to fit into the gang. But instead we’re looking out for the members instend I found that powerful for some reason What a film. The acting, singing and dancing made it such a treat to watch. And I really felt it, especially at the end.

A couple of specific observations/opinions. I felt a bit lost at the very start, like I'd switched the film on part way through. It wasn't until they started talking that I felt anchored in it. And I was a bit suprised when Tony declared his all encompassing love for Maria after only one meeting. (A disclaimer here that I haven't seen any other versions of West Side Story, film or play so no idea how it's previously been handled it).

Acting wise Rachel Zegler was the highlight for me. She had such a presence and really made me root for Maria (and Tony).

Overall so glad I saw it. Ansel Elgort was absolutely terrible in this. Every scene he was in was made worse by him and he was a terrible singer. Like, he honestly Almost pulled this movie completely apart. Initial reactions:

-Prologue. Favorite part of the original movie for me, the Robbins choreography is so taut and boiling with tension and just established character so fast and well. The new prologue felt jumbled and over too fast -- and I felt none of that crackling electricity and real animosity between Sharks and Jets at that early point. Everyone seemed so relaxed and it felt more like mild annoyance. I was surprised by how laid back and un-aggressive Riff was, though it becomes clearer why later and actually explains it better (he's played as a kind of complex, tragic figure with a death wish). The fights get scarier and better later on and the rumble is actually wrenching, but up till then, kinda just seems like a bunch of mellow guys mildly peeved with each other. 

-Tony is so much deeper and more layered in this movie, and Elgort does a pretty good job -- lovely singing voice. The baby face is hard to deal with but he brought grounding and depth to a formerly empty role. And how cool was the new ""Cool""!

-Latin characters all felt underwritten by Kushner, beautiful acting but just not given the same level of inner conflict or drama as the white ones. The women in particular were just so flatly written when compared to Riff or Tony. I feel like Kushner didn't really know what to do with Maria, Anita and Bernardo besides give them the most basic character strokes. It improves a bit as the movie goes on but you can definitely see where the screenplay's weight really lies.

-Rachel Zegler, WHAT a VOICE...tears. The balcony scene is magic. 

-Musical numbers felt a bit arbitrary/plopped in until we got to America and things got cooking -- the new America is FABULOUS and incorporates the whole neighborhood. Lots of good little character moments for folks like Chino. Overall, the numbers sung by Puerto Rican characters were better choreographed and filmed and executed overall, I thought (with the exception of the new ""Cool""). Dance at the Gym was a bit disappointing for the formerly mentioned reason, the Jets and Sharks never truly seem at odds or even to REALLY mind each other until later in the movie. 

-RITA MORENO singing Somewhere. Oh my god!

-ANYBODYS. Played by a nonbinary actor who delivers the first moment of true, shocking violence in the movie and really wakes it up. Extreme applause to Iris Menas and to movie for developing the original ""tomboy"" into something more complex. To be honest, Menas would have made a great Riff. 

-Back to Riff...I continued to feel really puzzled by Mike Daisy's portrayal until later on. In the original film Riff is a ball of tension, ready to blow, paternal and protective of his team but also a live wire. New Riff is...almost too relaxed in some ways, too unbothered. We get some backstory and some dubious explanation (Riff isn't *actually* racist, it's about...territory...?) but overall, Mike Faist seems much more inward and reflective and still and feminine and even intellectual than Riff 1.0. Like he doesn't even really care to fight. This finally clicks together at the rumble where it becomes clear that Riff doesn't really care whether he lives or dies, and has already in some sense chosen death, if that makes sense. We're watching a man who has already lost his will to live. It feels Shakespearean and ends up actually being quite powerful. But it took awhile to get there. As mentioned, Bernardo gets nowhere as complex a characterization -- his story is much more about pure survival and claiming his space and status, which flattens him out a bit. 

-Loved the Cloisters (?) scene, beautiful reimagining of the One Hand, One Heart scene. 

-I'd forgotten how bloody sad the whole movie is overall. The plot honestly makes much more sense than Romeo and Juliet as well. Every tragic mistake or decision makes sense and guts us with its ironies: above all, Tony ends up perpetuating the violence that he hoped to escape.

-I feel there is always more room to explore Anita's turn into a semi-villain near the end. Maria is an ASSHOLE singing about her love for Tony right as Anita is grieving her heart out, and Anita forgives her far too quickly for MURDERING THE LOVE OF HER LIFE. But I always think there could be more inevitability built in for her descent into ""Tell him Maria is dead."" Yes, it's a grief-driven betrayal, but in that case, show me her plans to marry Bernardo and have a family, show me more of her visions, show me more of what has been destroyed for her. It's incredibly sad that the singer of ""America"" ends up at the point that she would say Maria is dead and I want more of a roadmap there. 

Wow, that's all I can think of for now. Worth seeing, some really great stuff and some less great stuff, but overall, a great evening! Holy shit the sheer amount of energy and fun she had, she desperately needs a best supporting actress award. Like Rita before her she stole every scene she was in. She was incredible. She was great in the show Schmigadoon too. I literally have no idea who could have done a better job. They'd have to be a relative unknown like she was before this movie because nobody else comes to mind. I know she was already up and coming, but if she doesn't explode after this, it'll be a travesty. Was Alvarez just in the gym all the time during his hiatus? Because Jesus Christ, those arm veins are *unreal*. He wasn’t just a child actor on Broadway - he is among the youngest winners of the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. He won for Billy Elliot and split the win with the two other Billys! I feel like everyone was fantastic with the exception of Ansel Elgort. 

I can't think of another example this extreme with an incredible ensemble and just one bland, bad performance really bringing the average down. 

Many shining stars in this movie and one big black hole of charisma at its center. Yes, he deserves the praise also. Every supporting character was outstanding to me. His dancing and acting were absolute fantastic. Electric. Couldn’t take my off eyes anytime he was on the screen. When he did that jump spin, I gasped. I wouldn't be surprised to see her get an Oscar nomination I love that she was the one who sung that! Having Moreno’s character sing that song makes the movie more about the need for different people to live together rather than just how love can take you anywhere. It was. And I loved it while it was happening. But I didn’t realize in the moment that meant they couldn’t have Maria do the Somewhere reprise at the very end. Which, to me, is one of the most iconic moments in musical theatre. So I’m conflicted on whether or not it was worth it. Hmmm....didn't like it. I thought it was an interesting device at the midpoint of the movie when she sang it and they did the montage of scenes...but it ruined the ending. >!Its such an iconic moment when Tony lays dying and Maria tries to bring him back choking out the words to ""There's a place for us....hold my hand and we're halfway there..."" When, obviously, there WASNT a place for them. It just didn't work having her singing another song. !< I would have preferred it stayed with Maria and Tony. Rita's whole character and role in this film felt forced. The picture of her and Doc really jolted me--also liked her being Tony's boss, but also had a maternal influence on him, mentoring him a bit. and her singing was beautiful, soft yet strong, hard to believe she's 90. Great personal coup for her to win award for west side story all those years ago, and then work with the new generation on this one. The Tonight Quintet is my favorite number in the show.  For the 2009 Broadway Revival, they actually translated some of the lyrics into Spanish for the Sharks, and it works really well. That is how its sung in the orginal 1961 movie and Broadway show. It reminded me a lot of One Day More from Les Mis. Since West Side Story came first, I’m wondering if it served as inspiration for One Day More. I liked the decision to have Tony do Cool before the fight too, I like it's use to try to chill them out instead of magically making tge entire gang get over Riff's death in 3 minutes I’m glad you liked it! It’s always been my second favorite from the original! It’s so cool getting to see people get to experience the amazingness of this movie! 

I highly recommend the original too. There’s some obvious improvements here, most notably for me the inclusion of actors of color vs white people in make up, but there’s also really great moments in the original o felt this came no where near to beating. He really stood out as Riff. I have relatives in Ohio who know Mike Faist and his family. The dude is a total stand up guy in real life and still lives back home in Ohio because he hates Hollywood. So, cool how he could be nominated for an Oscar for this, he’s about to blow up. He commanded every second he was on screen. He should 100 percent get a Oscar nomination. He was the one I was CONSTANTLY waiting for to re-appear on the screen when I was watching. Something about him was just so interesting He's in the amazon show Panic if you want to see more of him. I couldn't take my eyes off him when he was on screen. And totally believable as a hopeless street kid with nothing but the Jets and his territory. And with a heart. 100% I will now go see a movie with him in it. He was impressive. Very happy to see him starting to get some roles and recognition

The guy is very talented - I was VERY lucky to win some tickets to the original run of Dear Evan Hansen with him and Ben Platt and they were both so great. He played Evan Hansen on Broadway when Ben Platt left the role (in Dear Evan Hansen). He was offered to star in the movie, but chose this instead. Wise kid! Too bad he says he might not do movies anymore and just live the van life. I know the critics have been singling him out, but I don't know if I really bought him as a tough guy. Something about his voice and way of movement just reminded me of John Mulaney. Yeah, I was like ""Who's this Matt Damon looking dude trying to make it in America. I like him"" to ""No homie, don't throw your life away"" the second Bernardo called him Chino. I genuinely felt bad for Chino in the movie. I seriously love how they made the Sharks represent something good like protectors of their community instead of just guys ""keeping things the way they were."" They have jobs and help the people coming in whereas the Jets are just guys who won't grow up and are a burden to society. I can see why Chino wanted to be a part of that even though his contributions outside of being in a gang would've been beneficial as well. I'm an almost 40 year old man myself and I cried and there's nothing wrong with feeling your emotions. >The shots of Tony and Maria noticing each other for the first time at the dance will stick with me for a long time.

It's way better in the original, but it has become a trope. The dancing floor dissapears and they're both alone, it's their world now. That always been the story, though. Obviously wasn't going to change. 
I thought it was a great adaptation. I mean, in *Romeo and Juliet*, Romeo is also the least interesting, least intelligent character in action. Practically Home Aloned him. oh my god that guy got fuckin WACKED 😂😂😂 I audibly laughed at that part. The sound design and editing of this movie was on point. I haven't seen the original in a long time, so I could be wrong. 

I like that we start with some violence because I don't remember anything really serious happening until the rumble, then it escalates. Helped set the movie apart from the original. “You wanna know how I got this … gun” Right before shooting Tony:

""You get what you fucking deserve!"" lmfao I think a piece of it was the Tony had taken the girl Chino liked. It wasn't front and center, but revenge could have sharpened his motivation at the end. Kinda sounded like him too He played Connor Murphy in the Broadway version of Dear Evan Hansen! He reminds me of Ducky from 16 candles John Mulajey minus self deprecating plus sociopath minus 20 year plus Broadway level dancing.  It quite the math formula. And Bernardo looks (kinda) like a Puerto Rican John Krasinski. Ooh, what are three other things about him?! I saw DJ Qualls from New Guy. Voice like Squiggy or Mocha Joe too It's after the rumble in the original Broadway production too. The 1961 film placed the song before Bernardo's death. I like having it after; it gives the song a darker, more ironic quality that captures the tragedy of Maria's romance with Tony. Man, I much prefer the placement of Keep it Cool here. Brought it from one of my least favourite songs in the original to one of my favourites in this Act 1 ends with the rumble so it doesn’t feel as jarring To me the fight is the climax of the first half and then would come the Intermission. Then this song to give you some time to breathe but still get back to the plot

I never saw the stage musical but others like Les Mis do it with One Day More and it madd tons of sense to me idk Only place it's not is in the first movie. It's just a lot less jarring on stage because there's an intermission. It’s a mirror of the scene in Romeo and Juliet where right after Romeo kills Tybalt and is banished we have a Juliet scene we’re she talks about how in love with Romeo she is. Dramatic irony that makes it all the more tragic when she finds out her live is a killer- I prefer the 1960s version that have this before the murder The America sequence was so beautiful, the costume and production design really shined. So vibrant and bright. It was wild that the comedy song happened right when they also had a character lock herself in a cell to avoid being alone with the Jets. Good foreshadowing, weird tonal choice. My wife went to the bathroom during this scene and when she came back I told her she missed a fun one. Could have solved everybody’s problem Great line. Terrible execution by Elgert I *loved* how they reworked ""Somewhere"" for her. One of the best scenes in the film. Having her sing the song made it so much more powerful. This character has lived through the tail end of slavery and into the start of the civil rights movement, and has seen so much change, but there’s still so much hurt. 

And then when you consider the meta of it, that Rita was in the original and was painted to be darker. And now 60 years later, we’re still struggling with these ideas and the message “racism is bad” is still vitally important. It made the scene 10x more heartbreaking. I just cried (again) listening to the soundtrack 5 minutes ago Ahh she absolutely broke me with Somewhere She turns 90 today, Dec. 11! Her and Mike were just outstanding. I didn't quite see the hype she's getting. I got more from Rachel, Ansel and Mike. And I didn't feel that Ariana topped Rita in the original. It was amazing. Another commentator here mentioned it was shot on 35mm. The colors and shot composition were absolutely fantastic. I almost saw this at the AMC across the street from there. That would’ve been ironic. I tell people this, and they just assume I mean it's another forbidden romance story. No, no, there's a Mercutio and Tybalt analog and everything, guys. lol People don't get that??? It's almost beat for beat the same story, nuts. Our English teacher showed us west side story in high school after reading Romeo and Juliet. So we were exposed to both mediums i know i’m late to this thread lol but i was looking for this comment! Frisson all up over my body when Maria and Tony swell up in union right at the beginning of the Balcony Scene/Tonight song “alllll the world it’s only YOU AND MEEEEEE” — i think that was the moment i was locked in. Maria’s staircase balcony lighting was angelic I know that's the way the story was but it really could have benefited from some time between the dance and the brawl. As someone unfamiliar with the original West Side Story this took me out of the movie lol. I understand it's based on Romeo and Juliet beat for beat, but I wish they'd have deviated a bit and modernized the story some more. This just felt completely ridiculous to me. This is one of my concerns. was this a non sense or they really portrayed an extremely immature and blindly in love teenager and that adds up to the story. (Yes, this is my first time watching WSS) He was Hemingway in Midnight in Paris and looks like a completely different person. Our generation's Gary Oldman I was thinking somebody like Josh Gad Yes, and same with the stage play, but Juliet kills herself in Romeo and Juliet. They didn't change much from the original, surprisingly. They moved a few things around but overall the plot didn't change much/at all Never seen the original either and it was brilliant, the best Spielberg had been in ages I'm a huge fan of the musical, and the original movie is great, but this movie outclasses the original movie IMO The part where they hold hands through the grates.…chills Yeah tony was the only character I couldn’t get into. I feel like he went in and out of a “New York” accent and his singing wasn’t that strong? He did grow on me as the movie went on Brian d’Arcy James is a treasure and Shrek the Musical is actually a really enjoyable and well made musical that probably gets overlooked because of the meme factor I don't speak a word of Spanish, but I kinda dug how there were no subtitles. The meaning of their lines comes through in their performance.

My friend who's Mexican said she thought the Spanish dialogue sounded a bit stunted. But maybe the Puerto Rican dialect is just different? I agree with you that Maria seemed to be too unfazed with the news of her brother’s death. Though she didn’t super close with him during the beginning parts of the movie. Agreed. There’s a certain feel to this, that I definitely feel in other movies where it supposedly was a top-tier director’s passion project, but it’s really hard to explain. In a cinema climate where so much feels so corporate and profits-motivated, you can just *feel* the joy in the filmmaking in this. Martin Scorsese’s *Silence*, Peter Jackson’s LOTR trilogy and *King Kong*, Damien Chazelle’s *La La Land*, and Denis Villenueve’s *Dune* have the same feel, and those are all “passion projects”. Conversely, I can often tell when a director was in a negative mental space when making a movie, especially when it served the movie for the best. *Chinatown*, *Raging Bull*, and *Apocalypse Now* are examples of this. I feel like that's always been a general criticism of the story. How could one forgive that so quickly? I thought this one did a pretty good job of showing that it's understood that if the fight happened someone would get hurt and I think she truly believes (because it's true) that Tony was only there to try and stop it. Bernardo isn't blameless either, he killed Riff. So it's less Tony killed my brother, and more this tragedy occurred and Tony was the last man standing. Why let hate and pain continue to stop happiness when they could both come out the other side with each other? I’m new to this story and agree with Maria getting over it too fast, though I think if she knew the truth about how Tony was trying to break up the fight, even walking away at one point, and Bernardo was the aggressor it may have helped.  I thought Chino was maybe going to say that. Though of course Tony killing Bernardo wasn’t a righteous outcome of it all.  Tony shoulda let that go imo. At that point it wasn’t self defense.  The ending was just tough to swallow all around.  I’m surprised how dark/tragic the story was (again, knowing nothing coming in).  Maria had it rough. And also how they're predators as well. This adaptation had so much more emotional maturity than the original, I was so impressed. 

I was genuinely surprised when Anybodys and the Jets gals tried to protect Anita, it stopped being about turf wars, and became more about girl code. In that scene does she call them racists or rapists? I heard the latter Oh, I thought she said “rapist” The Jets are 100% racist for sure, but so are the Sharks. What about Bernardo not wanting his sister to be with a white boy, or the racist ‘polak’ slur? And though the movie doesn’t talk about it, there is a lot if internal racism among Puerto Ricans as well, like colorism and prejudice towards those with more African blood. It would have been nice to see more racism from the Sharks. You forgot to mention Bernardo played by David Alvarez. The story of how they casted him is so [interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858k-QoE6a0&t=157s) Janusz Kamiński's cinematography is incredible, his camerawork has this larger than life aura in every shot and scene whether small or big, you feel it. To give you a little more context - They're ""siblings"" in that they hadn't seen eachother for 9 years before they lived together, and he's never really been particularly brotherly to her. Related yes, but honestly more like roommates.

I think if my partner killed my roommate I'd side with my partner too. It was amazing. It was so all for nothing. All those people died for no good reason. It really stayed with me for a long time. It is explaining why he is distancing himself from his very sad best friend.
Also adds bite ….see Bernardo's analysis of why Tony wants a brown girlfriend now. > This movie proves the need to cast a majority of the cast with Broadway folks. Wicked, take note.

This is so true!! They were the standouts! Well considering the plot it kind of worked to his favor. Thanks for putting my feelings into words. His face always seemed off to me. Agreed, they seem so empty...I never got why people liked him, dude always kind of turned me off in a gross way. Elgert has ZERO charisma. Easily the weakest of the cast. Zegler, DeBose, Faist, even the guy who plays Chino acted CIRCLES around him. Its kind of crazy that if Jane Campion gets nominated for *The Power of the Dog*, that she and Spielberg will have been nominated for Best Director in the same year twice nearly 30 years apart. It'd be the first time that a Best Picture Winner gets remade and nominated for Best Picture surely? *nakey Her brother also murdered his BFF.  
But the plot is, they're idiots.  They got married, and carried through  with the wedding night, all knowing the whole time it was impossible and never gonna happen.   Can you think of a stupider person for Tony to fall for than the gang leader's virginal little sister?  They were both living in a fantasy, he wanted change, she wanted rebellion and independence.

And despite alllll that, they still could have made it if it wasn't for those Jets.  The whole movie is the Jets ruining good things, really. It's Romeo and Juliet, so it wasn't unexpected, but if looked at realistically, it is quite a problem. Plus Sondheim and Bernstein put a beautiful song before it to distract us. The fault for that lies with Shakespeare. Even without the sex scene, she was still going to elope with him. So I'm not sure why the sex scene makes a difference. This is just America I guess, where people are always willing to criticize sex in some way. > She also loses her virginity (right?) to him later that night after finding out about said murder.

While wearing clothes with her brother's blood on. Like that's fucked up. And Anita was the one who was planning on getting laid that night. The best laid plans... I’m with you. I thought it was brilliant and had so much to say about the world today, while staying true to the original. I agree the tonal shift for “I feel pretty” threw me off though That Spielberg kid is going places! 

There’s so much to love here. I feel he gave the movie more context. Even in the opening scene, when the kids hit “edge” of the territory, it’s just pure genius. The scene at the police station puts all the characters front and center. I also love the shot choices, the colors in the film, the art direction. It made the movie feel like I was really watching a film made in that era, and not a reboot. 

Some films try to capture the period, but Spielberg not only nails the period, he nails the way the movies were filmed back then. I walked away incredibly impressed.  

Costumes, choreo, dancing, acting, singing, arrangements… this has awards written all over it. I thought it sped the story up nicely to have the meeting about the rumble at the dance, and the trance-dance meetup between Tony Maria felt like it didn't take as much time and was more natural. Simple and small changes I thought were pretty effective. And this Maria is not spray tanned with a terrible fake accent. It looks beautiful and I can't wait to see it. One of the saddest lines in a sad movie:  Riff puts on a super tough act to convince the barman to sell to him a gun, and the barman says ""You remind me of your dad"".  


Followed up by them using the gun to... play pretend. Riff treated Graziella well as her boyfriend, so I don't believe for a second that he would have resorted to sexual violence (or approved of it) with any woman.

Not to condone their behavior in any sort of way, but I do think it was obvious that the Jets completely went off the rails without Riff to lead them.

Having said that, I was never comfortable with the 'attempted rape' scene being in any of the WSS movies. I don't like how the writers cheaply go with the \~white privilege\~ aspect of having them scare Anita that way, instead of allowing the Jets to just grieve privately for Riff like it should have played out. And the costuming! The colors in the dance scene, with the Jets in blues and greens and the Sharks in reds was particularly striking, especially when they're standing across from each other. The lighting during that whole scene was pure expressionist greatness. Bridge of Spies, Lincoln and Munich all came out in the last 15 years, those are all among his best work, as is this. Yeah he was just serviceable enough that it didn't hurt the movie and he totally nailed the ""Tony finds out Maria is dead"" face, but far from the best performance. With his name, Spielberg is able to cast a number of wildly unknown actors like David Alvarez, who totally carried this movie on their backs. But Ansel really did feel like the one name actor they had to get in order to market and sell the movie, which even that ended up backfiring on them. I’m curious who would’ve been a better fit if they had gone with another name actor. He was better than the Tony in the original movie. Tony was always creepy to me. He also, imo, didn't look particularly dangerous.

Riff, who i bought as a street rat, seems to be very sure that Tony can shift the tone of the fight and my reaction was ""Because he's tall?"". He had an excellent voice though, and I did think he came across as very sweet. But I agree that he felt more wooden than Maria's actress. You didn't sí it coming. Yeah, I thought the critics were kind of unfair on him. I liked him just fine and bought him as a lovestruck young guy. 

His crying face is hilarious though. I loved his performance. It was amazing. I have no preconceived notions about him at all. Reading critiques about him are confusing. He was earnest and dopey and in love. I felt that the initial visual impression is of a suburban guy transported into the middle of a gang neighborhood.  He just doesn't fit. The lack of facial emotion is, unfortunately, a trademark of the actor. The costume choice goes down to the director It would have been good to show some foreshadowing of his rage behavior early in the film. (Throwing a can of peas in the cellar when something went wrong with stocking, then getting control of himself.) Where Ansel comes into his own is in the rage behavior when he gets Bernardo down and almost beats him to death. *That* is the underlying Tony. *That* is what got him sent to jail. I just needed to see it foreshadowed earlier. I agree, and this is one of my favourite shows. He surprised me in a good way. I thought he was great too. He looked like a new James Dean in a lot of shots. Not in likeness but in Hollywood coolness.

Just in general: but damn every frame of that movie looked so damn fine. Absolutely, it feels like the hive mind turned against him due to the allegations. but if you placed most those  people in a room of critics praising him as the knockout performance of the movie, hive mind would follow that instead. We are all far too impressionable. Agreed. The actors do such a great job that you don't need subtitles to overall get what they're saying. Thank you for pointing out the lighting. It seriously bothered me the entire film because literally every shot had its primary light source in the back. It's particularly noticeable whenever a scene was filmed from multiple and opposite angles because each shot would be lit from the background and not match light sources. In the scene where Tony and Riff fight over the gun at the dock between the shots the sun is either on the waterside or on the city side depending on the angle of the shot. Once I noticed it I couldn't unsee it.

The lighting also looked particularly off during night scenes because there'd just be this one or two huge unnatural lights up in the sky, the ""aliens are landing"" lights as you say. >better than the previous adaption,

I saw a revival of WWS on broadway directed by the original stage director/choreographer Jerome Robbins- and its hard to even put in words what a work of genius it was just in terms of staging - the way one scene flowed into another with scenery and choreography - it was like a dream.

The original WWS film is really a different animal (Robbins did most of the choreographer but was fired as co-director, apparently because he was an asshole as a person). In both the stage and original film versions Tony and Maria bland and Anita (Rita Moreno and in the theater version I saw, Debbie Allen) were the memorable ones.

Anyway, just saying the Jerome Robbins stage version was brilliant and I am looking forward to seeing the new movie. I saw it in a AMC Dolby theatre and it was amazing and if available,I highly recommend. Enjoy! It is a wonderful experience! Hth. The most stunning lyric line to me is in the ""Tonight Quintet"":

JETS: Well, they began it.  
SHARKS: Well, they began it.

That to me is the big tragedy right there. Because the real ""they"" is the society that's thrown them all out/forgotten them all. I was caught so off guard by that shot. The fact that Spielberg turns something grimy like a puddle in a dirty alley into a shimmering beautiful backdrop really highlights Tony's feeling of hope and joy in his bleak world. It's one of Spielberg's greatest strength as a director to use visual not just to wow, but also as metaphors to add subtext to a scene. There's a similar shot in Wise's version in the same song where the camera looks down on Tony against a back-lit cobblestone street with shadows cast by the columns behind Tony. Lets not forget Wise also directed in my opinion the greatest musical of all time ""the sound of music"". LOVED that shot too, that was gorgeous and so unexpected I'm 2 months late but [here you go](https://i.gyazo.com/0d0453047fe1a5598aded5b18968df0e.jpg) lmao [deleted] I was into it from the first whistle. I tried not to snap. I failed. I think you're mistaken about Valentina. Her character was invented for this movie, to give Rita Moreno a part and I assume to replace the Doc character with someone who straddles both worlds in a compelling way. 

I haven't actually seen this show on stage. Wikipedia says Somewhere was sung by a character named Consuelo in the original musical. Consuelo is a ""Shark girl."" This is actually kind of interesting to me. Why does she sing Somewhere? This. I love how Spielberg brought a delicate yet beautiful touch to a timeless musical as West Side Story that feels so wonderfully alive for a new generation. Truly one of his best films in a while. The original 1957 stage production was produced by 4 gay Jewish men. The Tony-Riff chemistry was tight. Wow wow wow. I was wondering how this was for non Spanish speakers because I felt it was being a bit too much, although they wasn’t important plots in Spanish, but your reply answers it. 
In the other hand, it was fun to perfectly understand both sides. I feel like them speaking Spanish makes it more realistic. And in the original the Puerto Ricans were mostly white people covered with oil, so this movie definitely makes up for that. I understood the Spanish though so who knows She was riveting on screen. She was just so damn good. She was fantastic given very complex work. David Alvarez stood out the most to me with the work he had been given. He was on an acting hiatus for more than 10 years and this was an amazing comeback. Ansel is the weak link for me, too, but I still found him serviceable. That shot of her, at the end of the tonight quintet, where she’s at the table, it moves in, and you can literally see stars in her eyes, was a great shot. It was amazing. If you've seen the 1961 WSS, there's no denying that he's objectively better than Richard Beymer. That's the original version of the song from the musical, where the song takes place at night at the point in the story where it takes place in this musical.  The first film version moved it earlier and into the day, hence the change to the lyrics. Someone in my screening literally yelled “oh no” at the end when >!chino appears behind tony!< That was so well done. I knew it was coming and I even felt the same as that dude. WSS is really top tier for supporting roles. Spielberg has wanted to make this movie since *before the original movie came out.* This might be the most passion-y of passion projects to ever passion, and it **shows.** There are some shots in here that he's clearly been thinking about for decades and it just felt like he was excited to finally be showing them off. >It seemed like it was just supposed to be this macho posturing that escalated into tragedy, for both of them. Maybe that was the point?

I think that is the point, and I've seen it done that way in the stage version before. But in both the original and in Romeo & Juliet, Bernardo / Tybalt is very interested in killing. In fact as Shakespeare wrote it, Tybalt takes a cheap shot while Romeo is trying to calm Mercutio down.

So this was Spielberg's addition. As was Tony having been to prison for almost killing someone. Those little additions really highlight how fighting is one thing but then it gets real. Can you elaborate more on the flaws related to Romeo and Juliet? I’m curious if the ones I noticed match yours. SO many lens flares. It’s like Spielberg told his DP to just color the inside of the lenses purple and point them at any light source they could find. 

I think it was a clever decision to try to modernize it while still shooting on film, but it was executed a little too heavy handedly in my opinion. Anita too. Also let’s give it to Rachel. Girl is 20 and just did Shrek in her high school. Get her a goddamn statue You forgot to mention David Alvarez as Bernardo! They had to reach out to him because he had gone off of the radar! This is possibly the best comeback anyone can make! @2:37 https://youtu.be/858k-QoE6a0 Also Jess LeProtto I think is a former Newsie! I don’t remember offhand if he was in the proshot though! It's a known name, so that should help. >I was surprised to see this thing had a $100 million budget, though.

The money showed though. Don’t listen to the other reply. You’re not. This movie was gorgeous and I’d love for other films to look like it Tony falls in love that quickly because WSS is a very close adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Your issue is with Billy Shakespeare haha. On the walk home, I was like, man, Anita got Tony killed. She lied upset him and he got the bullet he asked for. But then I realized the Jets killed him. Had they not assaulted and almost raped Anita, perhaps she would have said what she actually came to say. But in reality Tony killed himself because all he had to do was throw that gun into the water Great write-up!

I didn't think the Latin characters came across as underwritten at all. Kushner added just the right amount of extra shading to make them feel like living, breathing people, especially compared to their 1961 counterparts. I especially liked how this Anita is explicitly acknowledged as Afro-Latina, though there might have been a missed opportunity to explore that a bit more. Her scenes about Bernardo were completely outstanding. Hands down some of the best acting this year. She was so amazing, I actually think she should get Best Actress over Rachel Zegler (she was great but Ariana was something else). To be fair it's the role that most lends itself to show-stealing. [here’s an interesting story about they reached out to him while he was off the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=858k-QoE6a0&t=155s) He was an Army sniper so there's that. > Ansel Elgort. 

Have not seen the movie yet but have seen a few iterations of WSS and think Tony may be an impossible character to bring off well. The live Jesus Christ Superstar felt like this for me - I really like John Legend but I thought he was terribly miscast as Jesus, whereas everyone else (especially Sara Barellies and Brandon Victor Dixon) were amazing. He's a familiar face but I don't get why he got casted. Something about him is so unctuous looking and he looks greasier with age. Just not Prince Charming to me at all. He clearly didn't help with box office numbers either, I wish Spielberg just took a risk and cast an unknown instead. I dunno, that category is crowded, so 2 for one movie is gonna be hard. Especially because Debose is getting in I would. It was more or less a cameo. Definitely not Oscar worthy at all. She helped produce it so if it wins best picture I think she gets an oscar, but I wouldn't nominate her based on performance, not compared to some of the other films made this year Someone mentioned that ""Anita"" sang that song in this new adaption and I thought they meant Ariana would sing it when she was at the coroner's office. I like that Rita's version adds this sense of slight hopelessness like wishing in vain. I thought it worked and the silent cortege with instrumental somewhere was chill-inducing. Full agreement here. It was that one sort of explosion the film was missing. Fun fact: Lin Manuel Miranda wrote all of the spanish translations for that revival. It’s actually an opera trope. I believe it was show off your composing skills to get the leads to sing at the same time with their various motifs to bring the end of an act or scene. Considering the music is by Leonard Bernstein I’m sure he was nodding to previous compositional titans. La Resitance… Lives ONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.

Only reason I bring that song up from South Park is specifically because it was inspired by One More Day. “Cool” is before the rumble in the Broadway version. “Officer Krupke” is in Act 2 after the rumble, which is more jarring plot wise. yeah he was freaking incredible I see Mike got nominated by the Chicago Film Critics Association. Nothing else for him listed on the WSS Wikipedia page yet. Ariana is the most nominated with 8 nods. Rachel has 6. Ansel's been shut out. I don't quite see why Ariana is getting so much more attention than Mike. I know this is late but I grew up with Mike and went to school and dance school with him. He’s a great guy and was a funny, goofy kid. I’m so proud of him! I also heard this on a podcast. Do you have the article talking about it? Can’t seem to find it anywhere He gives off small Yippy dog energy, which is in line with his character. But that’s kind of the point isn’t it? Riff isn’t really the tough guy he thinks he is. I thought he brought so much new depth to the character. He definitely looks like Mulaney My friend immediately picked up the Matt Damon look. When the straight jacket came off, we see he can even dance...a little! It really makes the ending all the more tragic. That final shot of him being led off by the cops? Uttering heartbreaking. Same. It especially hurt watching him help Tony lift the shutters, knowing what was coming. Those two could have honestly been friends. Fuck chino Poor Tony 😭😭. My dumbass is probably the only one who didn’t know the whole story going in and I really loved him and Maria, that balcony scene was movie magic I think the most amazing thing about a great production of West Side Story (or Romeo and Juliet, for that matter) is that because the story is *so* implausible, logically, the hate and violence should tear all of these relationships to shreds *well* before the end of the story, when it does all get ruined.  In a *great* production, the performances make you believe the story anyways, beyond logic and reason. You buy into the love that keeps these two together. That through love, Maria somehow convinces Anita, for an hour, to help the man who *murdered her true love* escape with her (basically) little sister. It's so unbelievable, the fact that it can get you to suspend your disbelief for just a few minutes is what makes the tragedy come crashing down so hard. Because the love should never have gotten them so far. In reality, it would have been snuffed out at the dance.  


  
 I've seen a couple of *Romeo and Juliet's* that convinced me. I've seen 1 production of West Side Story that took me on that ride. The original 60s film version of WSS doesn't quite get you there, but the music and dancing are just so incredible it's still a good movie. I think this movie knocked it out of the park. ""Least intelligent character"" is a real race to the bottom in R&J. Romeo is definitely a candidate but Tybalt also makes a good case and Mercutio is kinda just a dumbass stoner. In the original film, one of the Jets gets his face cut by the Sharks. I like the change to the nail in the ear for the new one Tony also took Chino’s best friend and one of his motivations to walk the straight and narrow, to make good choices.

In the movie, Bernardo is proud of Chino’s choices in the beginning to the point where he wants his little sister, who he is very protective of, to dance with him. 

Ahh this story is so tragic, I cry I also liked that the creepy “Maria came to marry Chino on her brother’s orders” got replaced by significantly less creepy “Maria moved to live with her brother and his girlfriend, they all pay rent, and she’s just agreeing to go on one date with Chino because her brother thinks he’s a decent guy”. YES, thank you. I told my wife I couldn't stop picturing Riff as Mulaney time he talked. SNL definitely has some material next time Mulaney hosts. Ooh, what are three other things about him?! You mean Pretty in Pink The 1961 version also flipped Cool and Officer Krupke (the latter is in Act Two after the rumble, and sung mostly by Action, which is a bigger role in the show than in either movie). Exactly.  It makes the impending doom that much more painful. I like the placement too but man does the dancing in the 1961 version just rock. Sadly we can't have both agreed. The addition of Tony to the song attempting to quell his pals' bloodlust and the schism that forms between him and the gang made the stakes in the story grow even more. Thought it was an amazing adjustment. That’s how it is in the show, I Feel Pretty opens the show. I didn’t feel it worked in this film because we didn’t have an intermission to give us space to breathe. It’s just a tonal whiplash that doesn’t really land for me. I literally got chills from the ending of that scene, the dancing was incredible. America was what In the Heights wanted to be. I found there were some weird tonal choices a few times in this movie. For instance, the scene where Riff and Bernardo die… the music was too quirky and cheery. It felt very off for such a heavy moment. I understand that’s the original composition for the Broadway show, but it just didn’t fit the scene in this movie. Sometimes liberties can and should be taken, and this is very much one of those times. I use an app that tells me when it's a good time to pee during a movie, I'm always so worried that I'll miss something important. As always *The* best scene for me and the revelation that she’s Doc’s wife, and after seeing new Anita assaulted. It made the song so much more impactful. plus, the idea that hate perpetuates through generations wasn't quite as present in the original film and play. Like, it's obvious to the viewer watching those old films since we're still dealing with racial hatred in society decades later, but to insert it into the film in a tangible way that works on *multiple* levels as commentary (Rita Moreno being in the original adaptation and all) without hitting us over the head with it was just beautiful. And friar lawrence who makes medicine You kind of have to remember that not everyone really cared for high school English class. A lot of students did the readings last minute or just went through the cliff-notes, and the result is that the details of the story didn't stick. So, while a lot of people know of *Romeo and Juliet*, I think people mainly remember things like: *two teenagers were in love, their families didn't like it, and then they died for each other.* And most of that, I suspect, is reinforced by *Romeo and Juliet* pop culture references. Me thinks, the general public wouldn't remember who Mercutio or Tybalt are. That's all I knew about WSS going into it lol. Not even a song, just that it was the ""Romeo and Juliet but in NY musical"" Did you watch the Baz Luhrmann adaptation too? I think I watched 3 versions in my high school, which included WSS, Luhrmann’s version, and some other older Romeo and Juliet adaptation.

The Baz Lurhmann adaptation felt so weird to me. It's Romeo and Juliet it's a big part of the whole star crossed lovers thing. It's a tragic lesson about young love I don’t think that they necessarily needed more time but they needed far more focus on the relationship. And when I say focus I mean they need to make the word appear to disappear Tony and Maria as they think only of their love and forget the repercussions of what this means. New York is the most crowded city in America and in the original movie and the stage show, the relationship feels like the whole world. In this movie I was never distracted from what was going on outside of it. the reason the movie is a 4 out of 5 and not a 5 out of 5 for me, is due to the romance between Maria and Tony not at all being moving or belivable. I cared so much more for Anita and Bernando who had a mature love that had developed for 6 years. 

They could have easily fixed this by at the dance having them meet behind the bleachers, where we find out their romance started way, way before, but this night now was the first time they were actually caught. Perhaps it started before he went to prison for e.g. and the dance is where they meet again after he is released or something? For lmao. You literally just killed my brother like an hour ago? Let's fuck. Blame Romeo and Juliet. They’re hormonal teenagers making rash and irrational decisions based on feelings. It’s a little unrealistic by today’s standards but crazier things have happened, I’d say. That problem goes all the way back to Shakespeare. This is based on Romeo and Juliet and that was pretty much the whole point of that play Yeah, I feel like they didn’t realize that when making it more realistic they also make the plot seem more insane. 

Like us seeing Bernardo and Anita be real characters just made me hate Maria’s bullshit about having a love. 

They were in a long term relationship and you just met this guy who killed your brother and her boyfriend like??? In the original film, they’re young hormonal teenagers but I don’t think they’re aged up in this version. Maria explicitly states she’s 18. And Tony’s usually portrayed as a few years older (and same age as Riff). I think Tony’s meant to be like 21-23? One of the Jet dudes I couldn't help but think the whole time how much he looked like Joseph Gordon Levitt lol Yea, I was talking to my brother how it really just felt like a reskinned original to me. Updated picture and sound quality. Songs and scenes in different places. Lines altered a little bit here and there. But overall the same great story. I haven’t watched the original in probably 5+ years but it was my favorite while in highschool. There’s a lot of nostalgia for it keeping me from liking this one more but after so many people have said they prefer this version I’m gonna watch the original soon and try my best to keep the rose tinted glasses off. Yeah, I’m Mexican and thought it was fine. 🤷‍♂️ I'm Spanish American and I thought the Spanish was quite good. No issues for me. Your friend probably just has a little confirmation bias from what she's used to hearing. Not a big deal. Seriously. American here...What does that say about us that people would rather complain about not having subtitles than taking any amount of time in life to learn basic Spanish. I haven’t spoken it conversationally since high school, but I immediately know “siempre.” I'm Mexican American and it sound fine to me. Spanish is my secondary language though. It works a little better here than the original movie (she can see Tony got hurt, she knows her brother knows what he's getting into) but it feels like it's missing a song to me. Which is funny because the last musical I watched had Steven Sondheim in a key role saying a musical is missing a song. It's worth noting he shot this on 35mm film as well. I wish we got more time letting Maria come to that conclusion naturally. It felt maybe slightly better than the original in that regard but why not dive a bit into her inner conflict there She didn’t really love her brother that way. She says that she spent 8 years (I think) with her dad and they were fine. In many ways he showed up to disrupt things, and she didn’t respect him much. I kinda had the same problems but it’s also true that this is clearly influenced by Romeo and Juliet. So just two hormonal teenagers making rash decisions which it ends in tragedy I loved that! I played Anybodys in my high school production and it never sat right with me that she wouldn’t do something. Yes!! I felt the same about the Jet gals, I thought it was a brilliant addition. I believe she calls them rapists.


Edit: removed some words She calls them rapists, And she implies she is disappointed since she has known them since they were little kids and watched them grow up to become rapists. She did. Actually the movie does mention it, but it was partly in Spanish. When Anita asks Bernardo if she's not family, she asks if it's because of her color. David was great! He a such strong presence on screen, I like how tense he looks too. Like he's ready to exploded at any second. lol you’d side with a murderer? sure. Bernardo predicted virtue-signaling about 40 years early. Right. It works for a guy who just got out of a NY state prison after a year. (Trying to make himself a cypher inside.) It just doesn't work as well for the ""love at first sight."" I think we needed to see a little bit of Tony, the raging badass gang leader, earlier, maybe in his first confrontation with Riff.  In the play and the film his emotions and motivations don't matter so much because it is really a NY music/dance riff on R & J, but with the more realistic gang fighting in this production, a passive Tony becomes a problem until that rage comes out as he is beating Bernardo. (In a college production we did, the actor playing Tony  was an ex-marine returning to school. His underlying gruffness made all the difference.) It would have made this film waaay too long, but I wonder if it would have helped if Tony had *just* come back from prison, the Jets clearly respected and feared him, and there was a scene where Docs wife took him in and gave him a job. He would be raw.  The dance at the gym would be just like prison (constant conflict, turf wars), but then he sees an angel and he doesn't know what to do. Wow! Mutiny on the Bounty (1932) won and it’s 1962 remake got nominated a star is born First let me grab my screw driber Still tame compared to Mary Shelley losing her virginity on her mother's gravestone. It threw me off too but for me it was in a good way. The juxtaposition of the hopefulness in I Feel Pretty straight up dumped on you right after the brutality of the rumble made me feel extra sick realizing she had no idea what was going on. I never really liked the number, so I appreciated  the implied tension and anticipation knowing that she's about to have the whole world come crashing down. Apparently that's how it was structured in the original play. I liked the move (aside from me momentarily thinking they removed the song from the movie when it didn't appear in the same spot as the '61 film). Was a nice break from a slowly building tragedy. The only thing that stopped me from crying for the entirety of those last 30 minutes. Also Chinos decision to kill Tony (and where he got the gun) made more sense as well. I felt like every change they made was so smart, the whole story made more sense and had more depth than ever. Would not make sense to have the Jets rehabilitate themselves before Chino shoots Tony. Both sides are still out of control until Tony's death. Yep, for me his performance was hinging on that moment when he finds out and he CRUSHES it. I was literally holding my breath hoping he wouldn’t blow it. The smile on his his face as he's dying, knowing she isn't dead, was also perfect. Completely oblivious to any pain because he's just so happy to see she us fine This was it for me. He was good *enough* that I still loved the movie, but I don’t see what was gained from having him instead of another actor who could sing >he totally nailed the ""Tony finds out Maria is dead"" face,

That was insane. Pure horror in his expression. That just might be the Tony character in general. Awww, I really like the original Tony. He played that scene with the fake realization *slightly* too broad but it was believable enough Yeah, I didn't see any daylight between him and Rachel. I thought they both played the parts and sang equally well. I would've cast him too. What should be politically correct is not punishing someone for unproven allegations. Instead, what's politically correct is joining in on a witch hunt as soon as someone is accused of witchcraft. Bingo.  You don’t need to know what they are saying to know what they mean It's so funny to me that people thought Spielberg just fucking lost his mind and released it with the crucial plot elements unintelligible to an English audience What I meant was, in the musical it wasn't sung by Tony and Maria, like this film, but in the 1967 movie it was. And that was the most fitting. I don't speak Spanish, and it didn't feel like I was missing anything. I could understand them well enough just through the actors' performances. The Spanish dialogue felt like an extra detail for Spanish speakers to pick up on. I don't speak any Spanish and I actually appreciated there not being subtitles as it made me appreciate what the Puerto Ricans in the movie would have experienced in moving to America and not speaking English. I think it allowed for more perspective as to what it would be like, even for just small moments. I didn’t always know what they said but I always knew what they meant. The original taught us that anyone can be Puerto Rican with enough bronzer. Serviceable is so crushing when he's surrounded by potential Academy performances though As others have mentioned, I think the real problem is Tony as a character. Although I do think the change in Keep it cool boy helped improve his character. Oh neat I did not know that.  When we did it in high school we did the day version > Those little additions really highlight how fighting is one thing but then it gets real.

I think the Cool number in this one does this really effectively as well. It's all fun and ~~games~~ dance until somebody throws a punch. I think it's blatantly obvious. The story takes place over two days and is, essentially, a street thug love bombing an impressionable young woman who's just starting to learn about the true struggles of adulthood. r/AnitaDidNothingWrong And then of course, Chino literally killed him by pulling the trigger. I think one of the points of the story is that it's impossible to pinpoint the blame to one specific person or group. Not because no one's at fault be because everyone is at fault. She's the more dynamic character. She was amazing, stole every scene she was in.  And did she not get more screen time than Rachel Zegler? Wait the woman who played Anita was the bullet? He’s actually great.  Best Tony I’ve seen.  The Tony Kushnir book makes a huge difference for Tony and Chino I think.  I didn’t know anything about Ansel Elgort going in so maybe that’s the difference for me it's probably because he comes from a dance background. Dude is basically a professional level dancer. I thought his dancing was great, but the character on the page is just pretty bland overall. 

I think a better actor maybe could bring a bit more life to the role, but it also seems like there wasn't a whole lot to work with from the start. If I had to guess, it's because he was tall but still boyish enough to be the naive and optimistic Tony, like the original.  But the Tony from the '61 movie at least had the wild eyed enthusiasm and is kinda charming/good looking.    Ansel is kind of oafish, from his look to his body language (especially his body language...like he's *really* uncoordinated and when he runs, it's like he's never moved fast in his life).

You're right, Spielberg def should've went with an unknown.  I don't know why he didn't since outside of Rita Moreno, the cast is mostly not big names and the only thing anyone would really know Ansel from is Baby Driver, itself a great movie but not a huge blockbuster. It was definitely bigger than a cameo, she got her own song.  She had a huge presence in the movie, Oscars have been given for less. Additional fun fact: the original Daniela from In The Heights was the head maid at Maria’s work in the movie. Yeah you're right, it's called ""imbroglio"". It's typically used to heighten tension before a major event (like a rising action to a climax, generally at the end of an act) > It’s actually an opera trope. I believe it was show off your composing skills to get the leads to sing at the same time with their various motifs to bring the end of an act or scene. 

One day more takes this one step more. Each of the main characters sings their story in *someone else's* motif.

The whole first half is just setting up all the characters and the second is all about intertwining them. One Day More is all about setting this up musically without actually telling us. South Park did it too really well They’re in different categories?   You can give him praise without discrediting her. All cause Tony refused to forgive Bernardo. Man, I mean, I get it, but Bernardo’s actor is just so good that I felt that he shouldn’t have died to Tony. I loved the addition of that moment so much. They are both there to do the right thing. To help their respective people leave safely, and they both get consumed by the hate and rage that proliferates. Was there any point where you started to get the feeling he was going to bite it? Mercutio is way smarter than Romeo and Tybalt, not even close. Yup I was not sure how they were going to outdo the original ""America"" scene from the 60s film. If you haven't seen it [do yourself a favor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e2igZexpMs), it's one of the best dance scenes in early cinema. This new version blew my mind. I know I'm just a lowly internet peon, but I can't think how it could have been better. Another one.  Riff trying to buy a gun, the adults trying to scare him away from this boneheaded move, Riff just stares at them and  sticks his head straight on the barrel.    Next scene he and his friends are playing  with the like little kids, pretending to shoot each other? 

Actually, writing that  out makes it sound less weird than it felt watching it.

Maybe that Riff brought more intensity to the role than they expected. IDK. Sorry do you mind explaining the significance of her being Doc’s wife? I know it’s talked about a couple of times but not sure what it means, on a larger story level. Speaking of Anita, it feels so surreal and sweet seeing two Anitas talking to each other. I mean to say that it's a highly-specific adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. WSS follows the plot beat-for-beat. It doesn't just borrow the premise. >Me thinks, the general public wouldn't remember who Mercutio or Tybalt are.

Perhaps not, but there's also the two warring factions and plenty of other similarities including the ending of course.

I thought everyone knew WSS was **famously** a modern retelling of R&J. It's really common knowledge, at least here. In my high school we read Romeo and Juliet but not West Side Story, so I was completely unfamiliar with the WSS plot and characters when I went to see this movie.  Nobody told me WSS was like R&J, but I see it now. I thought it was more a tragic lesson about hatred between two groups causing nothing but destruction and tragedy. This would make arguably one of the most famous songs from the musical— ""Maria"" (""I just met a girl named Maria"") not work at all. >due to the romance between Maria and Tony not at all being moving

I must be a total sap then because I was a bawling mess at the end... So like real life then. Chad wins. Anita is literally waiting for Bernardo to come home from murdering white boys to fuck him while he's hot, so maybe it's a thing in their family. And plus in many Shakespeare plays, and plays in general,  the plot is breakneck. So things need to happen FAST. Though I will say that there are soliloquies about how a character feel about things. Or songs to show that in a musical. 

Surprised there wasn't one in this movie? They kept the story the same, but they added a lot of small things that I think really contributed to the depth of the story and raised the stakes. Tony never had much of a back story before now, and even Riff got some story added. We get the added layer of gentrification (with the Lincoln Center, no less!) on top of seeing the generational poverty and crime, especially during the gun-purchasing scene. Valentina is an infinitely more interesting character than Doc. They gave that moment of collaboration to Tony and Chino, and they widened the rift between Tony and his old gang. We got to see the Puertorriqueñas working in service of rich white people, we got to see the block party break out during ""America,"" kids and all, and Bernardo's gang in the boxing ring after the rumble. They actually toned down Shrank's racism, but they kept the police as the institutional protector of the rich and white status quo while humanizing Krupke in a couple of moments. Everything they added had a purpose and elevated the story for the better. Enjoy :) While I think the new one is superior, the original film is still brilliant. It won an Oscar for best picture, after all Yup. The spanish was definitely good, coming from a boricua. Yeah, as much as I like giving Somewhere to Rita Moreno.  Its kind of a crucial character moment for Maria that the movie didn't replace with anything Late to the party but yes I appreciated this added detail. In a lot of ways Bernardo made Maria’s life a little worse and he acted more like a guardian than a brother.

Whereas in the original film I was baffled at Maria’s reaction to Tony killing Bernardo. It was always a sore point in the movie for me that kind of ruins the experience because I hated *Maria* for reacting this way since in the original adaptation her and Bernardo were extremely close siblings. But in this remake I actually empathized with Maria since Bernardo (and Riff) got it coming and there was a sense of despair at the entire shitty situation where it felt like both deaths were inevitable. To me it felt WAY off especially how my elders talked about the times.  You would not have stood up for ""the enemy"" especially if they killed one of your own.  That felt like modern day wishful thinking to me. Isn't Anybodys a he? He spends the whole film trying to be accepted as a boy and finally does in the diner scene, at least that's my impression. Thank you!  I am a fan of Ariana and follow her on Instagram and she had made a post or comment that she wanted it to be mentioned that she is half black in the movie somehow, and I was looking for it and there it is. I don't speak Spanish so I missed it. I'm not sure if they focus that much on it in the original, but they do mention it a couple times in this and I know that she wanted to be seen as both and not just one or the other, as she commonly is other projects. Little late but Bernardo is also a murderer ""This white MF wants to bang my sister for selfish reasons"" is a pretty old  story.  *Schindler’s List* and *The Piano* were nominated the same year. I realize that I didn’t specify the films Only the 1937 original and the 2018 remake were nominated for Best Picture, and neither of them won. 

The original won Best Original Story, which is lucky since none of the remakes would be eligible for that one! :D It’s supposed to be a breather for the audience as we come back for Act II and Maria’s last moments of innocence before she finds out what happened and everything goes to hell. In interviews I have seen with Sondheim in recent years (the lyricist for WSS for those who don't know)  - he really has misgivings about that song and wished it hadn't been in the show at all. His face there made most of the people in my theater laugh out loud. I don't know about you, but nothing turns me on more than when someone follows me home, murders my brother, and then tries to run away with me without so much as the necessary bus fare to get out of town. Reminds me of the beginning of The Terminal. You didn't need subtitles to understand what Viktor was saying. You could understand through Tom Hanks' performance.

Now I'm curious to find other examples of this in Spielberg films. I didn't know that it was thing or that there was a controversy around it until after the movie. Looking at thread, you would think that half of the movie would be in Spanish. Maybe I'm not the person to talk since I'm Mexican but I didn't mind and thought it was more immersive. Most of time it was like a one liner or a bit of banter. And you could get the gist of it through the physical acting. I agree in a sense. I definitely would've preferred someone else in that role. But he didn't ruin it for me or anything. Exactly, BlazingCondor--her character, Anita, is bolder and has more to do. But I agree she blew Rachel Zegler off the screen. Yes. >  Ansel from is Baby Driver

I’m not a fan but this is way off. He was extremely popular with teenage girls after Fault in Our Stars in 2014. It made over 300 million at the box office. That’s $100 million over Baby Driver’s box office. Seriously...I watched a video with Spielberg explaining the casting and he said he cast Ansel because he watched Baby Driver and noticed Ansel moves well. I was like, seriously? He looks like a bean sprout with legs to me and looks like someone learning how to dance on Dancing with the Stars. He's not charismatic or someone to swoon over...he's also aged badly, he looked sort of boyishly cute in Fault of Our Stars but even then, I thought he was pure cringe in terms of personality. His father is a very famous fashion photographer and I just see him as someone who cut the line because of it. Ansel was the only reason my group of 20-something friends wanted to see the movie Another additional fun fact: Ariana Debose, who played Anita, is the Bullet Girl in the original Broadway cast for Hamilton. In South Park's case it was more a Les Mis reference. I mean in all fairness Tony tried repeatedly to stop the fight before it began. Repeatedly tried to just chat. Bernardo getting egged on by the Jett’s and the Sharks didn’t help either, but Bernardo caused his own death especially since he punched Tony first. Naw, so many factors. Like the Shakespearean tragedy it was, the forces were leading/driving the characters toward the almost inevitable conclusion. West Side Story is based on Romeo And Juliet, so that’s why Tony kills Bernardo after Bernardo killed Riff - because Romeo kills Tybalt to avenge Mercutio’s murder I didn't know either and I had a feeling when Anita was told to tell him she was coming...then I though ""fuck. This is a Romeo and juliet remake"" 🥲 and I was just sad from then on Mercutio is all talk. He's witty but at the end of the day his decision making is just as bad as the other two. That was one of my favorite parts. He's fronting so hard to the gun seller. Hard cut to he is truly a child. He does not deserve to own a gun. Kind of defines the Jets for me really.  They act like idiot kids but the stakes are entirely real and deadly high. Oh so how I interpreted was, Doc saw the same thing happened in the old days and presumably she knew about it too, and now she saw the same thing happened, so it’s like a never ending circle of these violent kids hurting each other. Her singing Somewhere made it even more grim. It’s not Romeo and Juliet inspired. It is a *retelling* of Romeo and Juliet. You’re totally right. Exacrly. That is one of the core themes of romeo and Juliet “Blackpilled again”

-Chino, probably I mean, the *loser* was a relatively successful boxer with a job and a longterm girlfriend, *the winner* gets shot an hour or two later, is an ex-con and living in the basement of essentially his mother's shop. They were just gonna fight bro I’d say “Maria” does a good job of showing how much of a dump Tony is. And “I Feel Pretty” shows us that Maria has mutual feels for Tony. 

But if you mean songs that stop and have the characters ask if this love is real or true or whatever, then yeah it’s missing. But Les Mis does the same thing and that’s a perfect show, so I can’t fault it for that.

EDIT: dump = simp I figured it was because both of their partners had just died. She sympathized with her. I feel like the women in WSS made it pretty clear that they did NOT support the fighting. They just wanted to dance and not have their partner killed. I think the women consider “the enemy” to be needless violence rather than each other. In the stage show and previous film Anybodys is a female “tomboy” character. In this iteration though I think you’re right that he’s trans. All good lol Thats totally how it felt like. I needed it and I liked it. Man no way, if you write the line ""it's alarming how charming I feel"" you gotta be **proud** of that shit! [But then we wouldn't have gotten this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7-vDjwautM) Yeah, he said the phrasing in the song was rather out of character for Maria but he was young and was just trying to flex his skills. He also admitted he wasn't upset about the song being cut from that recent modern revival either since it added some urgency to the second act and didn't throw off the pacing. It was the same face Ben Platt made through half of Dear Evan Hansen so…same here The digger in Jurassic Park says something in Spanish with no subtitles but you get the idea by his tone Yeah it’s kind of tragic all around. I will admit that Ansel played the realization that Maria was “dead” *slightly* too broad but it was believable still to me and I felt his devastation, which made what came after all the more upsetting 😢 Aw, I don't know Romeo and Juliet so I didn't know that paralleled it. I saw the original WSS about 30 years ago but now could not remember when Tony died or what the circumstances were. But I remembered it was coming from the beginning. So during scenes like the knife fight I was still in suspense wondering if that's when he was going to get bumped off. lol. But I was actually sad throughout all their romantic scenes, knowing how it was going to end. I cannot remember what I thought or how I reacted to the original 30 years ago anymore. The scene with them playing with the gun took my breath away. A really great choice. I felt like Riff was suggesting he was subconsciously suicidal in that scene. Then when he actually dies, he says it's going to be okay. He seems relieved to be checking out. I took it as a commentary on interracial relationships and being Puerto Rican in this area. Obviously in the original there is an aspect of the interracial relationships in the song but it still feels very much about Tony and Maria personally rather than society in general. With Rita Moreno singing it feels like she's saying that even though Doc and Valentina had a relatively calm experience, Tony and Maria's experience reminds her that society (or rather the local community) can still be hostile to those relationships and she hopes that eventually every relationship can be accepted. I think there's also this aspect that when she married Doc, some part of her identity was lost like when she said early in the film that Riff sees her as a *gringa*. Ahhhh I haven’t watched the original in a long time but that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for explaining!! ""I read Elliot R. manifesto last night, and I have a gun""

-Chino, allegedly. Any time you bring knives to a fight, you're expecting to kill somebody. >I’d say “Maria” does a good job of showing how much of a dump Tony is.

What does ""dump"" mean in this context? Like are you saying the audience should dislike Tony after he sings ""Maria""? They should have a word for these really tragetical stories they keep showing us! An that whole sequence was amazing. The cops and robbers game with a real gun, the dance/fight over the gun, ending with Tony in tears was incredible! Yeah I think he knows he'll probably die at the rumble and it's a relief. He makes such a big deal about pointing the gun at his own head. Then casually points the gun at all his friends. He's ready for any of them to die. No worries! Another thing I liked about the new version of *that scene*, was even though the Jets girls hated Anita for her ancestry it didn’t mean they wanted to see her assaulted. That was such a suffocating scene. I definitely meant to type simp and it autocorrected hahaha Yep, we can sum Riff's behavior up as self-destructive all around. It was a very powerful scene showing that the Jet's girl might be racist but he's not a monster.

I think the whole movie did a really amazing job highlighting how many racists are just acting out a cycle started by their parents/ancestors and it doesn't make any sense. I really loved how they made those other women stand up for her, the line was clearly being crossed.. I just felt like it said a lot about how girls in the last decade have been taught to have each other's backs more, rather than to see each other as pure rivals. I know it was set in the 50s, but it was a change from the original that I think said something about how things actually have changed some for women I LOVED that (the girl's reaction, not the assault).  My husband has an obsession with the original and I've seen it dozens of times.  My comment on the new version is that somehow Spielberg made it much more immediate and IMO less distanced than Bernstein's masterpiece.  I have seen the original assault scene probably 40 times and it NEVER hit me the way Spielberg's scene did.  There was something about the original that never let you quite forget it was a musical and everybody could break into song and dance at any moment.  But Spielberg went further, I think, and made it emotional and real. The way the other girls leapt to her defense felt so true; they obviously had their differences, but as women, especially as women who grew up in such a dilapidated place, they all knew what it felt like to be threatened and terrorized by abusive men. Even though none of them liked Anita, they knew she had to get out of there as soon as she could and they did their best to help her. It's touching in a way that they come together, but I think it's more heartbreaking that the thing they share in common is persecution from predatory men. OH you had me googling ""dump urban dictionary"" lmao This version also does a good job of showing how much of the cycle is driven by institutions through Krupke. In the original, he’s played as Shrank’s bumbling right hand, but here you get the sense that he’s just trying to do his best in a flawed justice system. ",1
121,"Anyone else watch the whole “Truth or Dare” scene through the cracks of their fingers? Seriously couldn’t stop squirming until the lights to her front porch turned on I teared up when Kayla asked her dad if he was sad to have her as his daughter. I definitely remember feeling like that as a kid, so for her to put the notion out there and for him to reassure her that he makes her so *so* happy was very cathartic for me. kayla: i feel like if i had a daughter that turned out like me she’d make me sad

me: stop the ride im gonna die Ironically the Truth or Dare scene in this movie was more terrifying than the entirety of the actual horror film called *Truth or Dare* The dinner date with Gabe was so hilariously wholesome, which felt needed after that truth or dare scene. I really want to know where they found that kid. 

""You know what would go great with this? Szechuan sauce.""  It's nice to see such a positive portrayal of a single dad As a former 8th grade band geek, that national anthem was the hardest I've laughed in a theater in a long time. Fucking perfect recreation of how bad a junior band sounds. I loved it.  *takes bite of chicken tender*

""Do you believe in God?"" Whats funny is that even if the memes weren't relevant  now, because its middle schoolers, it still workd  A lot of people mention how this really captures middle school, and all I could think while I was sobbing in theaters was how much her social isolation and anxiety reminds me of my life now -- and I'm in my late twenties.  I keep thinking I'll escape that intense loneliness and awkwardness one day, but I haven't yet. It's just repeat ad nauseum in every situation. That kid she goes on a date with at the end is 100% a redditor. One of the more heartbreaking moments in this film for me was after the scene where Riley tried to take advantage of her and she tells him ""Don't tell Olivia about this."" She thinks Olivia would find her less cool because she ""chickened out of"" ""doing stuff"" with a boy for the first time, when in reality Kayla trusted her gut, and did the right thing. Plus Olivia would have kicked that dude's ass for what he did. Olivia was the absolute best person to tell about it, and it was in Riley's best interest for her not to find out. Just devastating. So glad the high school friend didn’t turn bitch! Nice to see a cute girl portrayed as nice in a movie.  Man, this movie has some uncomfortable moments. Outside of the obvious moments (the car scene), Kayla being mean to her dad who’s just trying to support her made me really sad and, based on my own dad, worried that he was going to snap on her. But this wasn’t that kind of movie. The dad was just a super nice guy who wanted the best for his daughter. I loved that. I smiled so damn hard during the graduation scene when it looks like Kayla is about to go running after the boy in the hallway but instead goes to confront those bitchy girls  The scene where she prayed to God and just asked for the next day to be good even if the other days will be bad. I wanted to cry. I’ve done that so much as a kid, I didn’t think i’d ever see that on screen. Also, when she told her dad if he feels sad having a daughter like her...the amount of times I have said that to my mom isn’t unreal. I love that a movie finally captured all of this.  ""I can't wait to be you"" had me tearing up bad The scene with Kayla's dad while they're burning her time capsule made me cry. I wish someone had said anything like her dad's monologue to me at that age.  I really liked how her dad gave Kayla the advice to ""put herself out there"", and she initially blows it off like all teenagers. However, her next video is about putting yourself out there. I really liked that. It was an effective way of showing her dad's impact on Kayla and how she does take what he says seriously.  Gabe is my new favorite character in any movie ever... maybe because I know I was the EXACT SAME. Thank you Bo for making me confront my past self arguably TOO much The banana scene was my favorite. The whole theater was screaming.  There's been a lot of talk about how accurately the film portrays that age and modern teenage life, but I haven't heard anyone talk about what I believe to be the actual theme of the movie. Even more than awkwardness, I believe what Burnham is trying to convey is empathy. 

I'm not a girl in her early teens; I don't even *know* any girls in their early teens. Still, this movie made me really care for Kayla and her problems in a way that most movies don't. Suspension of disbelief lets us identify with the protagonist, but usually this is in service to the plot. In Eighth Grade, the plot itself seems to be a vehicle to bring us closer to Kayla. It's also emphasized several times that one of Kayla's strengths is her empathy for the people around her, and we see this play out in her interactions with Gabe (the nerdy boy) and even Riley in the mall. Furthermore, it's usually the other character's *lack* of empathy that makes them ""villainous"": the boys seeing Kayla only as a sex object and the popular girls not seeing her at all (literally). Olivia is cool not because she's popular but because she reaches out to Kayla, sees what she's going through and tries to help.

I believe what Bo is trying to do is instill a sense of empathy in us, the audience. And I *think* the intent is for it not just to be for Kayla during the movie, but hopefully to train us to be more empathetic in our own lives. I have to admit I'm biased in favor of that effort myself, so I may be reading too much into it there, but it wouldn't be that far out of line with other things Bo has done. His works often have a moral of sorts. And certainly Eighth Grade has made me want to care more about other people even if their problems are different than mine. I hope Elsie Fisher at least gets awards buzz for this. One of the smallest, but so real, details was that little ""blah"" noise she makes when she stumbles on or mispronounces a word in her videos. Growing up, I remember so many people nervously doing that when speaking in front of the class room. She brought that character to life. It will be a damn shame if this doesn't get attention at the Oscars. I will be very surprised if I love another movie more this year. Is no one going to mention the dabbing principal? 😂 ""are you my mom?""

For some reason this little background line during the assembly made me laugh the hardest. Little throwaway one liners like those used to happen all the time at my school assembly  [deleted] 👌Gucci! Lebron James This was fantastic. Let's give Bo another directing gig soon, ya?

The 'Truth or Dare' scene was the most uncomfortable scene in a movie this year, by far. I loved it. The pool scene & end dinner scene were highlights. I laughed so goddamn hard during the banana sequence. ""I'm pretty sure I made a note somewhere that you hate bananas"" might as well be the best-delivered line in the history of cinema. I love that the father-of-the-year keeps taking beatings but he just never goes down. Really wholesome stuff in this, mixed in with some insanely cringy self-relflection moments that make you almost want to cry about your own middle school experience. Elsie Fisher could easily be up for awards if this wasn't released in July. Gabe was awesome.

Although I did think it missed a 'punch', that something like *Lady Bird* & *Call Me By Your Name* have.The campfire Father/Daughter talk scene went for it but didn't quite get there in my opinion, even though I really wanted it do. There was definitely a Michael Stuhlbarg-like presence/performance needed for that scene to break through.

Best directorial debut of the year by a mile. Elsie Fisher is the breakout star of the summer, insane performance. Every second felt real. Felt more like a documentary than a movie at times. I love that they kept her dialogue real, like her lines were actually written by her, and not by Academy-award winning screenwriter or something. Some coming-of-age films are almost Sorkin-like, no teenager would ever talk like that. That feels like a weird compliment but it's true. I can see myself going to watch this again next week. Best coming-of-age film since *Lady Bird*. Bo deserves a lot of praise. One thing I wanted to talk about in 8th grade I just remembered
The popular girls mom goes out of her way to be nice to kayla and invites her to the party
And she starts with ""oh your dad was so great tell him I say hi""
Then she ends with ""ok hope to see you tomorrow, and make sure you tell your dad I say thanks!""
And I was like ""alright a little weird that the popular girls mom would do that, but nothing like overtly weird,  I'm just being cynical""

Then in I think the best example of ""show dont tell"" when kayla gets to the party we hear her video voice over, so we dont really hear the sounds of her entering 
But the popular girls mom goes ""where's your dad?"" And looks around and says I think mabye two more times ""where's your dad??""
And I was like ""oh I get it now. Shes divorced and has a crush. That's sweet, but still not really accurate to a popular girls mom""

And THEN
We hear offscreen
The popular girls dad say ""its cake time ""
And the mom said ""no not yet""
And he says ""I got up at 8 in the goddamn morning, eat the goddamn cake""


And then it all clicked and made 100% sense to me I loved this movie, but honestly, it also really hurt. It’s been a decade since I’ve been in Kayla’s shoes, but watching the film brought all those feelings back — the loneliness, the insecurities, the desire to be liked by your peers, despite the feeling that, deep down, you don’t even like yourself. Welcome to middle school.

One scene that really got me was when Kayla was talking to her dad while she burned her “hopes and dreams” and she asked him, “Do I make you sad?” As she went on to explain why having a daughter like her would make HER sad, I lost it. I seriously just started bawling in the middle of the theater.

There have been so many times in my life that I’ve worried about having a child like myself, not because I wouldn’t love them, but because I’m worried they wouldn’t love themselves. Like how I didn’t love myself at that age. Like how Kayla didn’t, either. I’ve always been so afraid that the world would make my child feel as small as it always made me feel, and that my efforts would be as useless as my parents’ were for me. Watching that scene made me want to go back in time and hug my 14-year-old self, to give her that same wonderful speech Kayla’s father gave to her, something I think I needed to hear back then. I didn’t deserve the amount of self-loathing I grappled with. I didn’t deserve to feel so worthless. I just didn’t understand that back then and, unlike Kayla, I wouldn’t learn for a long, long time.

And that’s what I loved so much about this movie — that it not only makes you feel empathy for Kayla, but for yourself. At least, that’s what it did for me. And I hope it will do the same for every young girl and boy who watches it as well. Maybe we all just need the reminder that we deserve it.

[Edit: Grammar] I saw this at Alamo with a livestream QA of Bo & cast. 

Bo said the difference between Elsie and everyone else they saw was so significant that he said the movie shouldn't have even been greenlit without having her first. She was perfect. 

Josh Hamilton plays the single dad. This may be the best portrayal of a father ever in a movie. I think at some point Bo may have considered playing the part, but that his youthfulness (among other things) stopped him. I also think he may not have intended for him to be single, but that having two parents in the script would on a meta-narrative level make people feel less for one parent than the other and so less overall for the parents. With only one family member for her to interact with, the emotional resonance is better in seeing their developing relationship. It also means he is more sympathetic, and I think plenty of people who watch this movie will varyingly consciously insert themselves as her dad (I did) and so amplify their empathy and appreciation of it all. 

There's an incredible smash cut in the movie that I won't even describe because I wouldn't want anyone to have it spoiled. 

The car was scary and saddening and I thought the resolution of it up to her dad going straight into her room(and the single take of this sequence) felt like it matched the overall tempo perfectly, like knowing your panic is gone and beginning to feel better but still feeling the pain of having been so panicked. 

Bo described his intention for the score to be “foreground music,” and Anna Meredith realized that intent brilliantly. 

At this point Bo seems to have succeeded at everything he has ever wanted to do, so I am curious if he will stay with directing or decide to climb some other mountain. 
 Can we come up with a list of what was in her updated time capsule? I saw:

* A picture of her and her dad

* A picture of her and Olivia

* A packet of McDonald's nugget sauce (!!! my heart!)

Anything else?  can we talk about how great the score was? I like the idea that Riley is a grown-up version of Aidan. Mysteriously cute and kind of charming, but also a massive fuckwad. After the backseat scene, I noticed that Kayla's interest in Aidan went away. One thing I really appreciate about this movie was how un-stylized it was.

The color scheme is just pretty natural.  Theres no fancy lighting or self indulgent shots.  The dialogue is very genuine.  It's not afraid of the natural ""um""s and ""like""s of everyday speech.  The humor is real, dumb teen humor.  The characters all look like normal people.  The dad isn't some wise Oracle.  Hes just a guy doing the best he can.  It really feels like we're getting a little cross section of a real person's life.  

This is probably one of the best examples of a ""slice of life"" film.  It's definitely not a lot like Lady Bird, but it's in the same ballpark.

Overall, a very solid and charming coming of age story.  Especially impressive considering it was Bo Burnham's directorial debut.  Bo Burnham did an incredible job of making this a truly honest coming-of-age film. You can tell he really researched what is like to be an eighth grader in our current society. Was anyone else afraid that it was going to end with Kayla not being able to regain any sense of self-worth after that truth or dare scene? This film easily could have ended with a dark and gut-wrenching message about sexual assault. Thank goodness there was someone like Gabe who she could lean on to help rebuild herself after that trauma.

Also, it's clear based on his past work (especially what. and Make Happy) just how much of himself Bo put into Kayla's character, with the mismatch of what she's stating in her videos with how she actually acts in real life and even using those videos as a pep talk to herself. Please go see this beautiful, amazing movie. It might be the best movie you see all year. I can't recommend it enough.

It's so rare to feel such a connection to a character. I was *so* nervous and anxious for Kayla whenever anything happened. When she was waiting for her high school mentor, I was so worried that she wouldn't show up or she'd be mean or whatever. It was *such* a relief when she was nice and kind and friendly to Kayla.

I also believe this movie contains the only know instance of a person becoming more likable after quoting Rick and Morty. If I had watched this at home I'd have paused it 30 times and paced around cringing. This hit so close to home. I really loved the scene where the kid born in 2000 was making fun of the kid born in 2004 for being too tech-y. It’s basically like when old millennials hate on new millennials for being introduced to technology at a younger age. It’s so stupid.  I think my favorite part was when Kayla finally spoke her mind to the popular girls on graduation day but she still didn't quite have the confidence to look them in the eyes. That was the most realistic and personal scene to me, just getting so pent up that you finally start shit talking but you're not at all used to it because you try to be a nice person so just look away while you do it. That's me x10000. 

I loved that the movie showed that approaching your fears doesn't mean the fear goes away. That just nails down anxiety, whether you're in 8th grade or college or retired. Obviously so much thanks to Bo but I have so much gratitude as well to A24 for providing the freedom to filmmakers over the last few years to create such meaningful content. *Eighth Grade*, *Lady Bird*, *Good Time*, and *The Florida Project* have connected with me so personally and are each in my Top 5 favorites of 2017 and 2018 respectively. Am I the only one a little upset at the missed opportunity to not show at least the thumbnail of the grapefruit video when she was looking for tutorials on blowjobs? I swear it feels as if Burnham was watching “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” one day and said, “What the hell? This isn’t what middle school was like!!” Whereas other filmmakers would diminish the realities of middle school by pandering to a younger demographic, Burnham grounds the entire story in reality. He isn’t hyperbolic with his characters, but he perfectly portrays character types that we’ve all known in middle school. The way his characters talk to each other is real and akin to people that we’ve most likely encountered in our lives.

Watching Kayla’s struggle to interact with others and the built up social anxieties she would face reminded me so much of myself back in middle school. Even some of the pauses in her dialogue in which she repeatedly stutters by saying “like” and “um” are reminiscent of how I used to carry myself during that time to an extent that some of those even carried on to this day (mostly the stuttering part). 

I’m just going to come out and say it: comedians are the most innovative and creative minds working in the film industry today. You got your studio filmmakers who make huge spectacles that are valuably entertaining, but comedians know how to tell stories, and not just in the genre you would expect them to dive into. From Tina Fey’s “Mean Girls” to Kumail Nanjiani/Emily Gordon’s “The Big Sick” to Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” to now Bo Burnham’s (WHO WAS IN “THE BIG SICK”) “Eighth Grade”, you have a wide variety of excellent features that tell amazing and heartfelt stories, whether they be comedy or horror or any other genre. I blame Mel Brooks for all of this. Mel Brooks started this comedian-being-amazing-filmmakers trend and now it is in its renaissance. Please, comedians... Please write and direct your stories because they’re much more impactful than the roles they give you in Hollywood sometimes.


[FULL REVIEW](http://rendyreviews.com/movies/eighth-grade-review) People in my theatre were laughing during the car scene and it made me feel ill. Please please please let this replace whatever generic biopic we're getting this year at the Oscars. For the first 30 minutes i was like ""Jesus Christ, this kids life makes me want to kill myself"".

Than i realized, ""oh shit, that's how she feels"".  Not a lot of movies that can effectively put you in someone elses shoes.  Im a 45 yo guy, so making me empathize with a digital, image obsessed eighth grader is a pretty impressive feat. I think a good detail to take note of is how when Kayla does her videos, she tends to do that stereotypical teenager speech thing where they always say ""like"" alot. The ""likes"" got more consistent and frequent the closer to the climax of the film (truth or dare scene), but by the end, when Kayla is finally feeling confident with herself and lacking the anxiety that characterized her for the entire movie, she only said it once in the entire video. She made her message to herself without any anxiety, with confidence and assurance. I know I'm late but I just had to talk about this. I'm 18 now but when I was Kayla's age (I'm in the UK so I'm assuming she's about 14?) I was so, so like her. I was extremely ""quiet"", painfully shy, riddled with acne and just as friendless. I also dealt with pretty severe social anxiety (which I still do to this day, but I'm much better at coping with it) and panic attacks, so seeing her panic attack portrayed at the pool scene was fantastic, as well as her pacing around during the phone call, etc etc.

Her relationship with her dad was also something I really identified with; during the 'eighth grade' period of my life I was extremely unhappy, lonely and self-conscious, and while I had always had a great connection with both my parents, arguably more so than most, during the 12-15 period of my life I could be really mean to them. I wouldn't ""act out"" like going to parties or doing drugs etc because I *couldn't* (no social life!), but I would get home and go straight on my computer, read my book all dinner time without talking to them, be constantly irritable and snap at them really easily, and looking back on it now it breaks my heart that I treated them, although not regularly, like that, because they must have felt terrible. But I know I did this because I hated how 'useless' and ""quiet"" and friendless I was, I hated how I couldn't be a normal teenage daughter for them and had brought them so much stress and upset and disappointment that it was better for them to be mad at me than concerned. Her dad's speech towards the end made me bawl.

The car scene was also extremely upsetting. I have been that girl in the backseat. Many of us have. I was young and lonely and anxious and desperate to be liked and accepted by others, and I was in a situation where an 18-year-old boy like Riley pressured and manipulated 14-year-old me to do things I just wasn't at all ready for or at all comfortable with. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to bring myself to say no like Kayla, or at least I wasn't able to make sure this no was respected and heard, but simply apologise and cry for not being more ""mature"" and ""normal."" That scene made me sick to my stomach and was so well done.

I know I've gone off on a personal rant here but that film really affected me. It wasn't visually the most creative film I've ever seen but it was incredibly well written and acted. Props to Bo and Elsie. I've tried so hard to forget 14-year-old me and am much happier as 18-year-old me (it does get better!), but this film almost sort of allowed me to put my heartache and pain from that truly awful time to rest. [deleted] I know everyone went apeshit for Timothée Chalamet last year for the “young actor who can act with professionals twice his age” or whatever but I’d be damned if Elsie doesn’t get a nomination this year for her role, she was incredible in every sense Are we for real just going to sit here and pretend like that band teacher didn't have obi-wan's padawan rat tail from phantom menace? [deleted] Who would have guessed that two of the best horror movies of 2018 would come from A24? I enjoyed this movie a lot, I related so much to the awkwardness that I felt physical pain from cringing at it.

The one thing that sticks out is that it doesn't fall into the typical tropes that you would expect it too - Bo keeps it real.

Side note - this is the first time an audience in the theater actually added to the movie for me. There was a group of kids in the row behind me, each looking between 5th and 9th grade, and the way they acted coincided with how the kids in the movie acted which only validated for me. The kid behind me accidentally hit me in the head as walked out of the aisle and said sorry awkwardly three times, lol. It was a great experience. Notice how the movie starts with her recording a video to the public, and [ends with her recording a video to herself](#spoiler). She learned over the course of the film to do things for herself, and not simply try to please everyone at the cost of her own sanity. Honest question: do girls just ignore another girl talking to them whilst staring at their phones? That scene was so unbelievable. Too many things were so cringey in this film, I hope they are exaggerations. Guys she burned a Harry Potter book I thought the movie did a great job capturing the YouTube/Social Media scene today. It should be an interesting time capsule of being a middle schooler in 2018. The theater went from 60 to 0, during that backseat scene...  The truth or dare scene aged me 10 years and made me existentially question if I want kids. Thanks Bo! This movie was painfully relatable, especially the entire scene when she's walking into the pool party. The ominous horror movie music as she looks over the fun summertime pool party with the kid like crabwalking upside down. It's so funny and well done but also so painful to remember.

Or every time they showed her following a conversation and she's saying ""yeah"" or ""cool"" but you can't hear her, just see her mouthing it.

So many times she's finally talking in a social situation and you get all excited but then it was just ""oh like that's cool"". Like you want to yell at the screen SAY SOMETHING WITH SUBSTANCE!! But it's so accurate, we're just not used to seeing that kind of honesty in a film.

It was all so accurate and I've never wanted to hug a movie character more in my life. I also had a rough time in middle school and put a lot of YouTube videos out there (versa 2007) so there's that. honestly it is so underrated on how accurate the portrayal of the teenagers in high school were in this movie as well. That conversation at the food court I feel could of happened in real life.  olivia is so sweet. gabe too. i love kayla, and i'd be lying if i said i've never done the things she did in this movie. except for the banana scene. i like bananas. Normally in movies, I've noticed that if characters pray for something, that's normally a clear indicator that they won't get what they're praying for. But the fact that Kayla prays for a good day and actually gets it was quite refreshing.  This movie brought back a whole WALL of intensity I had forgotten I felt in middle school. Kayla exploding at her father because everything feels like it’s **so** urgent is relatable. I remember blowing up at my parents like that over small things and I still feel bad about it.


 I almost forgot I was watching a movie because it felt so similar to my life when I was that age. The scene where Kayla’s at the pool party made me feel like having an anxiety attack. I forgot how vulnerable you feel at that age and how everything is all about how to be cool. 


And the scene at the mall!!!
I swear everyone’s felt that way. You’re hanging out with a new group of potential friends and you only know one person so you don’t know what to say or how to react or when it’s okay to jump in. They got that awkward part down perfectly. 


I wish we had gotten to see Kayla in high school. I didn’t want her story to be over just yet. 



What an incredible director debut. I can’t wait to see what Bo brings in the future.  This movie hurt me and healed me at the same time. This is so much like me, except I was a boy, and not nearly as brave as this gal. Kind of at a loss for words My favorite part was when Kayla sings karaoke at the pool party. She didn't care that noone really cared about what she was doing, she was just happy ahe mustered up the courage to do so. I honestly remember going through exact moments like this, and this movie brought me back to a time I had almost forgotten.  As a 20 year old dude, I can say that this movie was realistic as hell. Even the little things like the kid saying vine memes during the speech that actually was a thing tthat happens.  I'd really like Bo to revisit Kayla's life in 4 years and make a Twelfth Grade. I cringed out about 30 times but the film wanted me to so it's fine. Also, it's great directed and performed, even or people at such small age, so I guess I'll give it a solid 9.

10 if they showed Gabe more. Best character. This movie is almost like a period-piece about this modern period. Even in five years, this movie will be technologically dated (instagram layouts and stories) so it's so specific to this time. But the most important thing is that the movie focuses more on the feeling of being that age, more aided by modern culture. 

It's been about 12 years since I was in eighth grade, and it seems like middle school has changed so much.  Are active shooter drills super common and normalized? I feel like that's necessary, but still bizarre. Are schools totally relaxed on cell phone use? Every kid had their phones out in school the whole time and were so blaze about it. In high school, we used our phones, but it was always so secretive. Also, I don't remember teachers trying to keep up with kids' lingo or anything, like how the teachers were dabbing and saying ""lit."" However, I was still able to relate to parts since it really captured that feeling of being young. 

There is so much to talk about with this movie. I really like the camera work and how it really makes you focus on certain things. Like when Kayla is talking to that popular girls mom but the mom is out of focus in the background. Lots of cool stuff like that. lebron jaaames Enjoyed this much more than *“lady bird,”* which I would not have expected, having come of age in the 90s myself.

Just felt this character was more relatable, I guess and seemed more true to real life than lady bird.

My #7 movie of the year so far. I thought Josh hamilton was fAntastic as the Dad, and Elsie Fisher is top notch. 

**Grade: 3.75/4 stars, A-** I knew it would be relatable in some sense, but I had no idea exactly what I was in for. I saw myself in Kayla more and more every scene, and it caused me to cry multiple times for seemingly no reason. 

Excellent debut from Bo! 

Excited to see where he goes from here.  As someone who suffered from social anxiety in middle/high school, this not only hit close to home, but it's probably the most accurate representation of what SA feels like. That movie was so stressful and cringey, but in good ways. It was exactly how teens are, very well done. I covered my face so many times. It was just too relatable. A lot of people have remarked about how uncomfortable and horrifying the backseat scene was, but I was almost just as disturbed by the issue of requests for/trading nude photos, for a few reasons. For someone at that age it might seem like a harmless way to show intimacy or whatever, but once that stuff is out there it becomes not at all a matter of intimacy or gratification but a lever of power that someone can use to control you. It's hard to know Aiden's intentions there, but what could be a positive relationship can quickly turn.

Suddenly having sent the photos to someone could result in public humiliation, bullying, blackmail, or all of the above. Additionally, this being children we're talking about, there have been documented instances where people involved have been prosecuted(!) for sex crimes(!) and permanently place on the sex offender registry(!) for sending and/or receiving such photos.

All in all, a bad and scary idea and it's disturbing the extent to which that has become part of the culture. In the movie the characters don't even treat it like it's a big deal. I really liked the scene at graduation where it looked like Kayla was walking after Aiden, then turned and  told off Kennedy.  The verbiage that the writers used was really clever and seemed like something a newly confident 8th grader would say to someone who has wronged her.     Ugh I literally had a friend like Olivia in high school (peppy friendly cool girl with curly hair) and one of her friends sexually assaulted me so the build up to that scene hit me really hard.  Everyone is saying how so relatable this is, but I can relate a notch more than everyone else.

I don't have a single friend and I'm in college. No friends, no social interactions. Nothing.

So I could relate to so much of the film... except when she has the confidence to actually do things.

Because of this film, I would like to change my life, but unfortunately it can't be changed. I'll be friendless for likely another year.

A great film but very sad for me to watch. I've never felt uncomfortable for an entire runtime of a movie before, but in a great way. There were times when I just wanted certain scenes to end because I couldn't handle what was going on (most notably the truth or dare scene of course).

It felt real, in the sense that the events were unfolding as they took place. Every conversation and person speaking felt genuine - there were the ums and likes, the stutters and pauses as opposed to anything else. I was so satisfied with how they ended it too, no big revelation or third party to change her fortunes overnight, but rather small progressions towards a better tomorrow. It may not happen right away, but it will someday. This was really, really nice. Almost nothing looked phony, all of it felt like it was happening.

For as great as they are movies like Lady Bird, Edge of Seventeen or Call me By Your Name still feel a little Hollywod-ish. This  doesn't. What's the song whenever her ""crush"" keeps popping up? This movie made me experience a new emotion that I can only describe as “happy cringe,” specifically during the chicken nugget dinner scene that made me smile like an idiot 'Stranger Things', 'IT', 'Cobra Kai', and now this.  

Where'd all these fantastic young actors come from? It's been a long time since I related to a character so much in a film.

The scene with her Dad next to the fire and the line ""If I had a daughter and she turned out like me I'd be sad""  that fucking broke me.  I thought it was a very accurate honest take on adolescence and puberty but I expected it to be funnier (coming from Bo) and more interesting. I found it kind of...well...boring. I prefer ladybird or the kings of summer. It’s a good movie but ain’t no 98% RT score in my opinion. For me it was forgettable. Millennial viewer here. This movie made me incredibly sad at times, but I loved it. The awkwardness and insecurity and anxiety of being a middle school girl was poignantly captured. I wanted so badly to give Kayla a hug and tell her that things get better! As far as coming-of-age films go, for me Eighth Grade will definitely linger longer in my memory than Lady Bird and Boyhood.  this movie gave me an anxiety attack for 90 straight minutes and I had no idea a movie could have that much power over how I felt, absolutely amazing Cinematography is something I've fallen in love with, and I love to see it done well, and I think this movie is an achievement in cinematography.

Did anyone notice the amount of long takes in this? The opening monologue is one cut, the majority of the dinner scene, the cut of her rolling up to the party, the cut of her walking into the backyard and getting into the pool, and the cut of her running into the house and up the stairs after the car scene. The way the camera just sits there stagnant at times, like in the mall the cuts just hang there. The way the actors were able to keep the uncomfortable pacing, and to see Kayla mouthing what she wanted to say but was afraid to speak up or even know how to inject herself into a conversation really stuck with me.

There's very little shot/reverse shot, and the times I noticed it were important. The campfire scene is one of them, we see then problem from both Kayla and her dad's perspective. She's finally being honest with her dad and herself and we the audience get to see it from both perspectives. 

The entire scene in the car is multiple cuts, but the camera location doesn't move. It's always from Kayla's point of view. Riley says something and the camera is from behind the driver's seat. Then it cuts to a close up of Kayla's face and the camera is still from behind the driver's seat. Bo's trapped us in the car with this situation happening to us, we never view this scene from the other side of the car, and the audience can only look on and hope Kayla makes it.

The script and acting were top notch, but I think a nod to Andrew Wehde's cinematography with Bo's directing is very well deserved. What I loved the most about this movie was the father/daughter relationship. Sure, throughout the movie, we see Kayla zoning out her dad or ignoring him but they are both mirrors of each other. I have a feeling when Kayla becomes a parent, she will be just like her dad. Just like how her dad was probably just like her at that age. And that scene by the fire was beautiful in how her dad tells her that he will always love her no matter what and that he's happy to be her father despite everything. That part made me cry. I just thought it was beautiful. what an awesome film.

I'm so glad we didn't have social media and smart phones when we were in middle school.

Myspace was more than enough. Former bully here.  Wish I would have seen this movie back when I was around this age or in high school.  The way I acted would probably be seen as too unbelievable to put in this movie as the popular kids had more just apathy towards her...while to some kids I was relentlessly evil.  Even to girls I was a dick, but thinking what I would have done to that Gabe kid made me fucking sick to my stomach.  This should be required viewing for everyone in middle school.  This was like watching a horror film for someone like me to really come to terms with some of the things that I did to people and how they must have felt. I was a happy kid, a bunch of really close friends,  not abused, fairly wealthy (not bill gates, but got a new Lexus when I turned 16 etc..), good athlete with near perfect test scores, not a deeply closeted homosexual or anything, just bullied to bully I guess.  Now I am a grown man watching this and wanted to cry thinking about the stuff I did and how it probably affected people.  

&#x200B;

My critiques and they arent big ones but I assumed all the kids in my high school at least had some friends.  I felt she would have fit into some group or something.  I also felt the lack of a mother was a big deal and should have played more of a role rather than one line from her dad, ""When your mother left I was scared..."" I really thought this was a perfect movie.  I remember watching The Breakfast Club in the 8th grade in Health Class and not relating to that movie really at all.  I felt for this girl though and think everyone could.  One of the most stressful movies I have ever watched. [deleted] I really did not like this movie TBH. It was far more painful than anything else...it is definitely not at all a comedy, even though it tries for levity at times and was written and directed by a comedian. It’s more like a horror movie on what it’s like to be too ill-equipped to deal with a world that expects too much out of you. Don’t watch this with the expectation of being entertained. It’s an hour and a half of cringe-worthy moments that hopefully make you feel more sympathy for our youth who are starting to learn how to be adults. If you didn’t have that already, you’re a dick, and if you did, then this movie will do nothing for you other than make you feel really awful for 90 minutes. What was great about this film is that every character is relatable and real. Like they feel like people we know and WERE as kids. Personally I connected with Gabe, as I was incredibly awkward and weird at that age. 10/10 from my favorite comedian.  [deleted] [deleted] Movie should have been about Gabe I actually started crying during that last scene, jesus. Been pretty depressed lately and could relate a lot. I actually didn't feel like this was a comedy at all. I laughed a couple of times though. My butthole could sharpen a pencil throughout this one. Obviously loved the fire scene. Awesome film LeBron James.  [deleted] The soundtrack by Anna Meredith is really phenomenal and part of why this movie works so well. Extremely accurate portrayal of an 8th grader in 2018, but does that necessarily make for a great film? I argue no. It needed a stronger plot, structure and compelling characters. I enjoyed it, it had its strengths, but ultimately I can't rate it higher than 6/10. I think Aidan's eyes is one of my favorite comedic moments I've ever seen. I don't think I've ever been that uncomfortable in a movie theater in my life. This movie is so damn good and so damn accurate of awkwardness (though I'm not a girl I still could relate to the awkwardness) and I'm just so happy Gabe lived nearby and she took a chance to be his friend Just got out of my second viewing of the movie and all the feelings hit just as hard as the first time. Switch the genders and about 40% of what Kayla goes through applied to me as well, haha. The backseat scene is probably the most tense scene in a movie I've seen this year, forget Avengers: Infinity War. 

The first time I saw the movie, I was alone in the theater for an early afternoon showing. This time however, there were a few older people in the theater with me. For some reason, after the car scene, when Kayla walks in and slams her door and everything goes silent, some lady in the theater chuckled.... What the hell? Just saw it last night, incredible film, I could relate to it so much than other coming of age films.

One small detail I loved about the dad is how when Kayla asks him if he's sad for having her as a daughter, his first reaction is ""Do 
 I seem sad?"", above all, he is worried if that's his portraying attitude to his daughter. Small detail made me really appreciate the character. Flawless performance by Elsie Fisher and Josh Hamilton. I loved it, but man I kinda wish I had waited for home video....

This film is so like cringey uncomfortable that I felt myself sinking down in my seat with embarrassment for the character. This movie made me feel like I was back in middle school This masterpiece solidified my belief that Bo Burnham is truly a genius. I'm incredibly excited for whatever comes next from Bo. The kid who plays Gabe was great, he should’ve been in this way more lol. As a millennial, this was the first time I’ve seen a “youth” movie and truly felt old. Great job Bo As someone who graduated high school in 2017, I’m a few years older than Kayla but I can still say without a doubt this is one of the best depictions of current generation. They specifically nailed the way social media is apart of their lives. Unlike some certain other films (such as F the Prom), it’s written very natural. I was in 6th or 7th grade when Facebook came out and I remember everyone jumping to use it. Subsequently I remember Instagram and Snapchat becoming big. Me and my friends had a similar conversation the teens did about Kayla’s generation growing up with that stuff and how it has them “wired” differently. Idk what point is trying to make, I just thought Bo worked it in greatly. 

Along with that, I related so much to Kayla. While I had a different personality and problems, i remember being in situations like the pool party. The film made me relive some embarrassing, cringe memories about middle school. Overall, I really loved the film. This is definitely in my tops of the year.  I legitimately thought this movie was perfect.  It was hilarious and stressful and captured middle school better than just about anything else I’ve seen. I enjoyed it. But god damn, is this how fked American schools are? I went to a pretty good school in Australia and there was nothing like what i saw. The ""popular"" girl never hated the quiet, shy girl. It really does seem like these movies dial up the awkwardness by 100x sometimes. I've yet to watch a movie that really showcases what school was like. i saw this last night and I cannot get this movie out of my head. Its the most authentic movies about childhood I've ever seen. It just feels so real to the point where I couldn't tell if it had a script. There's something I feel like everyone can relate to in it. I cried I think 3 times and its not an especially sad movie. It just hit me at home so often. If you were born in the late 1980s and 1990s I feel like it was made for you.  I cried and hugged my best friend at the end.  I also thanked the Universe that I grew up and learned how to socialize.  What a trip back in time... It's been nearly 20 years since I was in eighth grade but this movie was so fucking relatable! Bo's work is incredible, as always. Just finished the movie. I was so surprised at how great it was. The monologue from the father made me tear up a lot. And tbh, I nearly threw up during the truth or dare scene — too much cringe in one moment lol. 


10/10 I loved the movie and read so many comments. I’m so surprised that no one mentioned the soundtrack. It was incredible. It matched my emotions the entire movie and emphasized the tension and nervousness that Kayla felt to a tee.

Plus, on my like $100 sound bar it still managed to sound amazing just for music’s sake. 10/10 I think the portrayal of the relationship between Kayla and Mark is *amazing*. Josh Hamilton needs a lot of praise for this role as well, he's fantastic. Every scene between the two of them is pitch perfect. 

The car scene is one of the saddest, most realistic things ever. I felt so bad for her. As soon as he pulled over and got out of the car, I was just like, oh, no. Not this guy too.

Times have moved on a bit since I was in eighth grade, since social media wasn't really a thing yet back then, but everything else still rings really true. The scene with no audio with Kayla and her dad after the truth/dare scene. Part of Bo's brilliance is we don't hear what is said and it's up to us to determine whether or not she told her dad about the incident or if she didn't and he pried it out of her as some dads can do. It certainly is interesting to think that she shared with her father the incident details since a few scenes later the bond of an already strong relationship get's solidified when she asks him if he'd like to share the hopes/dreams burn moment with her. What do people think, how much did she share with her dad about the attempted assault?
 Movie had me cringing, laughing out loud (this might be the first movie in about 48 movies I've seen this year that actually made me laugh out loud), super creeped out in the car scene, and then back to laughing at the end play date. I think the fact that I'm laughing by the end instead of cringing during the awkward dinner scene at the end had to do with the movie taking me on  a journey with the character, who went from being uncomfortable to being at ease with someone around her own age.

Also like the use of the vlogs to tells the story and the soundtrack. Pretty delightful film and definitely worth watching.
 One of the most grounded and realistic depiction of the 8th Grade. First thing first, I like that the actors were age appropriate even the high school ones. Elise Fisher (who was actually in the Despicable Me films) was incredibly natural with her ""ums"", ""uhs"", etc. I remember a topvoted comment on reddit somewhere about something a film doesn't portray realistically and it was about how characters didn't really stutter or think when they talk. 

I like that there wasn't any stereotypical bully antagonist. Kennedy didn't do that mean to Kayla other than ignoring her. Come to think of it, eighth graders are apparently really addicted to their smartphones unless this was done more out of social commentary. Meanwhile, the high schoolers seem to talk more with each other. 

Of course we have to talk about the car scene with the high schooler, Riley. Talk about tense and uncomfortable. It does defy expectations because you expected Riley to assault or rape her, but he doesn't go that far. 

Despite Kayla being sympathetic from lack of friends and being a loner, I did like that she was still portrayed as flawed. The most obvious where she makes hypocritical YouTube videos on advice that she doesn't follow. The second being that she's a real brat to her father who tries real hard with her. 

I find it strange there aren't more serious(in terms of not being patronized to kids) films made about the seventh or eighth grade. Those were middle school grades for me back then, and they can be a lot more awkward than high school. They are after all the transitionary years from elementary kid to almost high school adult with puberty kicking in for some around that.  One thing I really, really appreciated is that they never really show her being bullied. You feel like something horrible is gonna happen at any time which is exactly how I felt through all of 8th grade personally.

What an amazing film. Other than Jordan Peele, I can't think of another first time writer/director to absolutely blow both my mind and expectations out of the water.

I can't urge anyone with the opportunity to see this with a crowd enough **to go see it**. I don't mean to sound hippy dippy but seeing it in a packed house: The movie is so visceral, every high and low I felt like I could feel the crowd's energy more than any movie I can think of off top (if that makes sense?). It's such a simple rollercoaster of cringe and relief. I literally have nothing bad to say about this movie. The birthday gift scene was so uncomfortable to watch. I haven't felt for a film character this much all year. No over the top cultural references and ham fisted drama?? How will this survive the test of time???
/s

Really really good, can’t add much without reiterating what others have said This is 2018's Florida project if you ask me. Both well grounded, relatable amazingly well crafted films that got overlooked by the general audience  Underrated element of a very good movie......the soundtrack. Loved the synthwave vibes, the atmosphere it created.  The line about always feeling like you're waiting to ride a roller coaster and never getting the feeling of actually riding it really hit home. Such a great description of anxiety. Weird perspective on the car scene with Riley:

So, I'm a teacher, and I've done middle and high.  When Riley got out of the car, my middle-school-girl protective side went straight up.  I was so tense.  When I saw Riley's mannerisms, and how he handled it, out came my high-school teacher side.  It was very bizarre because at first I was so protective and so tense about a violating moment, and then when Riley's also-childish behavior was pretty apparent, I became really empathetic for both of them while understanding that they were both children and all things considered, however uncomfortable, it was a pretty common experience.  Yes, a 16-17 year old propositioning a 13-14 year old is very uncomfortable for our adult eyes.  But it happens all the time, and remembering that the 16-17 year old was \*also\* a child was a very interesting revelation.  I think a lesser film would have gone out of it's way to make Riley seem predatory, whereas this film makes him seem in-the-wrong, sure, but awkward and unsure. Ok this is gonna be personal but it's the only thing that's ever made me reflect on my Middle School years in a rational way so..

Everyone talks about surviving Middle School. They don't talk about how much it changes you. I was a completely different person from 5th grade to 8th grade. (Though in some ways, that was because I refused to change enough.)

By 7th grade I was literally leaning against the sides of hallways when I walked alone in school, like some weird, primal instinct. I didn't do this consciously. All the self-confidence had left me. By 8th grade, I was moving my chair close to the teacher's desk when we had to do silent reading because it was the least embarrassing option, when compared to sitting at a table with kids who wouldn't give me a second glance.

And though I didn't go as far as Kayla in terms of trying to reinvent myself, I related to so many things... making plans in spiral notebooks to get my friends back together. Trying to leave myself positive messages. Feeling like I suddenly had all the confidence I had lost when someone I admired talked to me.

I graduated High School in 2016, and didn't get my first camera phone until a year before that, so the social media stuff wasn't as relevant to me. (I loved that scene at the mall where they talked about this. It's so important.) But there were kids with iPhones as early as 2010, in 6th grade. In my 8th grade class, a kid was expelled (iirc) for soliciting nudes, and having some connection to storing or receiving them on his school laptop. It was then that I told myself, *I don't want to be popular anymore. It's not worth it, it's not worth it.*

I'm getting really personal here lol, but I don't have people to discuss this movie with. I am so so glad it exists.

Also, this is the most relatable portrayal of anxiety I've ever seen. When she was talking about how it was like the feeling of waiting to ride a roller coaster without being able to ride a roller coaster... that's the **best** way I've ever seen it described because it shows what anxiety does to you. You avoid your fears, but there's no relief there. You miss the things you could have done, and new fears will always replace them. They pile on top of you and make you shrink. I'm trying to grow again. Having something to relate to really, really helps. Wow, that was really hard to watch. But like, in a good way. Does that make sense? Seeing a guy I grew up watching his career absolutely nail a movie about...growing up is strangely cathartic.  Beautiful commentary on the depth of kids today, honest highlight of what the struggle looks like at this age right now, and an example of stellar parenting.
I’ve watched Bo grow up and I’m so proud of him!  He’s an outstanding example of what this generation has to offer.  One of so many- they’re all the most amazing kids in the world (mine included :).  I apologize for the gushing, I’m nursing a bit of an emotional hangover.  :)
 My only critique with the movie was the ""gucci!"" at the end. The time capsule and the high school relationship show how rapid change is. Kayla changes throughout the film. Even her videos change in content and tone. However the cliche phrase im torn on. Does it invalidate a significant portion of the change that Kayla exhibits? While she does seem more mature, does its continued use provide further insight to how immature she really is and balance the endings serious tone? On the other hand it feels ironic because of that perceived realization. Gucci as almost like a fuck you to all the stupid bullshit she just now realizes is stupid. 

Maybe its intended to be ambiguous, maybe im reading too much into it. 

Lastly it's kinda scary how much culture permeates into the lives of young people. The entire make a video, like, subscribe, views, gucci stuff makes a statement about how unavoidable this stuff is. I take my own kid into example (11) and see him parroting things that he's never seen before. Stuff like fornite dancing when he's only played it a couple of times. The dancing however the thing that stuck. Just weird. Makes me think about what that was when I was a kid. 
 I am a 26 year old male who was kind of introverted in ms and hs, tho I did have some friends. This was so good tho, omg I cant imagine what kids are like nowadays. Elsie did an awesome job and so did Bo burnham. Amazing.  As a man, no scene like the ""truth or dare"" scene has made me so disgusted and reminded me that there is such a way to go with respect, and dignity when it comes to sexual boundaries. I had seen this scene so many times before in movies but this really resonated with me so much more than the others. I just watched that and it dawned on me that this happens to so many young women, and continues throughout their lifetime. I feel disgusted with myself for my ignorance in the past to the issue, and angry at the present that it still has to be changed.  I don't know. The movie was definitely good and I praise it, and the truth or dare scene was perfect but I just don't find this movie relatable at all...

I understand why and how it's a very accurate portyal and it hits home with many people, especially woman, but I just didn't find anything relatable and didn't feel too invested.

Maybe it's because I'm a guy, or because I find it hard to believe she wouldn't have a single friend which would change the dynamic of the movie completely, but I'm bouncing between a 6 or a 7 out of 10 God damn Bo, how did you know exactly what it was like to be a middle school girl, being raised by a single dad, socially awkward, and so desperate for something to change?? 

I'm 29 now and it brought back all sorts of memories about my own middle school experience. From being one of the most quiet kids to being unnecessarily rude to my single father trying his best. The feeling of getting the pity invite to a party to trying to be cool and edgy online. The isolated loneliness and the absolute thrill when if even for a moment I felt accepted. All of it was so spot on.  Go see it. Will be on my top ten films of the year lists. There's was no way I was going to go see this and then I listened to Bo Burnham on Marc Maron's WTF podcast and decided to give it a chance. Glad I did. Something that stuck with me about the back seat scene or truth or dare scene as people are referring to it as was how Kayla asked Riley not to tell Olivia. How fucked up is that? It was such a manipulation that she felt that SHE was wrong and she felt like she had to keep it a secret when HE should’ve been the one begging her not to tell. I’m a male, so I don’t personally know what it feels like, but I have a feeling that this sort of thing happens to females way more than we realize. This is the best movie I have seen. 

I'm not saying this movie should hold a place in cinematic history or anything but for me, this is the best movie I have ever seen. 

For the reason that I feel this movie spoke to me and moved me and made me feel understood. 

Bo Burnham is a national treasure and one day, I hope I get to personally give him a quick thank you for making this movie. I’m gonna file this one under the really good movies I’m never watching again cabinet. I’m not sure if it’s because it gave me middle school ptsd but this movie was so anxiety and cringe inducing. 10/10 for accuracy, though. And a nice reminder not to have kids That scene was *so* well-directed.

The lighting, keeping the guy's face in shadow. The blocking, keeping Kayla in the foreground and the guy in the background, with her never looking at him. Only using two camera set-ups (the one just mentioned, plus the one isolating Kayla in the frame) to keep the tension up.

Oh Bo. Yes, oh my gosh. I've been the girl in the back of that car. So proud of her for forcefully saying no. It made me so uncomfortable but glad it happened. That's real life for so many young girls. Just watched the movie with my 11 year old and we had a big talk about that scene on the way home. I couldn't stand how manipulative he was. When he made her blame herself for it there were audible groans in my theater.  When he got out of the driver’s seat I braced for the worst and the movie actually went there.  The way Kayla was apologetic afterwards was so sad.  I wanted to crawl into a hole during that scene. Holy shit did they nail it. I’ve never wanted a scene to end quicker in my life. It just feels like an eternity she’s trapped in that car. My god, I could not handle this scene. My girlfriend was grabbing my arm and squeezing it hard as she could, because of the anxiety.

To make matters worse, there were a couple of old ladies in front of us, I shit you not, LAUGHING at this scene. I know a discomfort laugh is common for some people, but this really didn’t feel like that.

It felt like that “well, boys will be boys” mentality personified. It made the scene all that much harder to watch. I could hear several women crying during that part, including one behind me that sounded like she was having a panic attack. I thought it so perfectly depicted what happens to a lot of us - not rape or assault, but a deeply uncomfortable and manipulative situation that can affect how we feel about ourselves forever. I was so proud of her for saying no. My wife clawed the shit out of my arm during that scene. It's hard to watch It was a brilliant scene. Kayla went from being incredibly torn, to finding her voice and spirit for a split second when she finally said no, then humiliated. Incredibly acted and directed.  I thought it was going to turn out a lot worst. Thankfully it didn't.  I like how real it was despite how uncomfortable it was. I thought it was truly fantastic that Bo was able to shine light on a situation that I believe happens a lot to young kids in those situations.  Yes!! >!When he said that it was awkward talking to her in the back seat and pulled over, obviously everyone thought she was just going to move into the front seat; but when he moved to the back, my whole theater gasped/groaned/“oh no...”!< I looked over at my two friends I saw it with, and one had sunk so low into her chair that her hair was on the seat cushion, and the other had his head between his knees with his hands over his head/ears. 

This scene was far far too relatable. Very hard to watch.  I put my sunglasses on  Someone in my theater shouted ""oh nooooooo"" when he offered to go to the back seat. An incredibly uneasy scene.  [deleted] I have only been that scared in Nocturnal animals during the scene where he tries to get in the car with him[seriously that was fucking scary] and the visit where you find out they arent the real grandparents[its hokey but the whole time im expecting some crazy demon or whatever, and then it turns out it can HAPPEN irl] That was the most emotionally devastating moment for me. It truly hit the nail on the head for what I was experiencing at the time. No bullies pushing kids in lockers, no pack of nerds who at least have each other and play DnD. Just pure isolation and a lack of any self esteem. I could relate to nearly every single scene in this film. 

A lot of people empathize with Kayla, but I think that Kayla's experience is still fairly unique, which is probably why I cried three times during the film.  During that scene I thought we were gonna find out the mother died, but hearing that she just “left” made it way more sad for me.  That was such a strong scene. At first he seemed to kind of be saying generic stuff she wanted to hear just like he did in the beginning when he was telling Kayla she was cool. But then he really dug deeper and talked about how lovely she was as a child and how he was scared after the Mom left. His dialogue went from cookie cutter dad talk to the real talk that Kayla needed and that their father/daughter relationship needed.  I was full on sobbing during that scene I also liked how genuine and honest his answer could be. I mean, I don't want to say that parents talking about special and perfect their child is isn't ""true"", because they do believe it, that's just how many parents are. But they always say that. But when she's specifically asking about whether he's happy to have her as a daughter, you knew that his response would be 100%, completely genuine, because I'm sure no matter what troubles she has, she's probably one of the best parts of his life.  Fattest tears suddenly fell out of eyes right then. 

I'm a mother of a 14 y/o boy. It was weird that it sometimes felt so in the nose as both being a parent of this age and having been an awkward teenage girl.  I’m having a daughter in November and that scene just killed me. Big dude next to me was ugly crying. Yes I could hear it.  I want to get off Ms. Kayla's Feels Trip I was involuntarily curling up in my seat, hiding behind my hands, holding my breath. I have never been so relieved that a scene ended. My theater applauded when she gave him the harsh ""NO"". It was like she had just defeated the villain/big bad of a horror movie, unbelievably intense.  I was waiting for something to happen, like she gives in and takes off her shirt and it leads to an absolute shit storm, but luckily nothing really happened, but just as ""nothing happened"" the experience still fucked her up.  I know it's bad considering the context, but I was expecting Young Predator to say, ""That's not how the game works,"" with a hokey distorted face after Kayla chose ""Truth"" for the second time in a row. ""Do you believe in God?"" ""You can have any of my sauces"".

D'awwwwwww :') I loved that this tension-relieving moment of all the 'how do I connect with people??' anxiety was a simple ""I like that show too!"" The movie had a lot to say about identity at that age but I thought that was such a simple and relatable moment. I couldn't agree more! Without the juxtaposition of Riley's creepiness, Gabe's chicken nugget scene would have been laughably cringey on the other spectrum. Something Dwight Schrute would pull.

But that sweetness (and spiciness) and (chicken) tenderness that Gabe shows in his own unique way, is not only relieving, it's the exact thing that Kayla needed in her life at that moment. It really highlighted how important kindness and respect can be, even if it's bacon-wrapped in cheesy dorkiness.

That sharpshooter got his 4th bullseye that day. I was in a live Q&A  back when it initially released and Bo said when he came in for the audition Bo told him to have small talk with Elsie and he said ""Do you like tacos?"" and followed it up with ""Hard or soft-shelled?"" and that's when he knew he got the role and Bo said he separated both of them from there on out until they filmed the scene together. I saw it a few weeks ago and they had a livestream Q&A afterwards. Bo said there is a 15 minute magic show that Gabe did that they cut from the film. Bo said it'll be in the deleted scenes on the bluray. my iq wasn't high enough to get that joke When I say all men are trash I mean all men except Gabe from Eighth Grade  It was such a relief. Hysterical.  Man, I loved that character. One of my best friends was such a Gabe around that age, and I could see parts of my eighth-grade self in him too. Total dork, but he couldn’t care less.  Both dads in the movie were great. Kayla's dad was so wholesome and Kennedy's dad just wanted everyone to eat his damn cake that he woke up at 6 in the fucking morning to make. God, too true.  I'm a single dad (with a daughter that's just started high school) and we went to see it together.  I was relieved that Kayla's dad was just a guy that's trying his best in uncharted waters, fumbling for words at times, making bad decisions, but ultimately so in love with his daughter that he'd do anything for her.  He's not played as a buffoon or a foil or a wet blanket.  He wants the best for Kayla and doesn't quite know how to help her during a time when no one really knows what to do or say. That scene where she burned everything in her time capsule was so well acted by both actors I felt like Bo Burnham casted himself in 20 years. At the time I had no idea how bad we were. This film made me think ‘Oh. Yes. This is what we sounded like. On a good day”. I wasn't a band geek, but I was dying. That was incredible, and I love that they didn't cut away, just let the gloriousness shine through. I was in tears from laughing so hard. I thought ""this band is way too good to be a middle school band."" Wasn’t a band geek but an orch dork and yes it was 100%. Nobody being confident in the notes they’re playing, sharing stands, people dragging and rushing I was in band too and that was beautifully terrible. Oh yeah for sure, anyone who was in middle school band can relate. That scene was on point.  I thought that young actor killed it, absolutely killed. He was hilarious, and nervous, confident and insecure and above all kind person, all in one go. Very impressive.  Bo said in his AMA that they had to update some things because stuff wasn't trending anymore. Like how they started doing shots using Messenger but they switched to Instagram because its so much more popular with teens now. *dabs* Middle schoolers tend to be a year or two behind high schoolers. You'll still find some eighth graders dabbing and thinking fidget spinners are cool right now, though most moved on eventually. Of course, teachers are like three years behind middle schoolers, so that all works too. I knew when I was watching it that there'd be other people that relate with her even though they're not the same age, and to a point, I somewhat do. I definitely related more to her when I was in middle school though.

The thing that hurt the most out of the whole film was when [she says in her final YouTube video that she just feels nervous all the time. Like she's about to get on a roller coaster, and that butterfly feeling in her stomach. But she never gets the triumphant feeling after, she just keeps feeling nervous](#spoiler) and all I could think was ""jesus christ, this girl is portraying how I felt up until the age of 17"" That part is also why I'm extremely anxious about watching the movie, like I'm 19 and I've watched people change from cringe machines to confident people who put all of their troubles behind them and have majorly changed in the process.

In contrast, from the comments here, I feel I don't relate because I didn't try to be cool, hang out with guys, have major self esteem issues or change myself as a person. Obviously, eight grade was cringey as, but far as growth and confidence goes, I wouldn't say I'm there yet, and it's only now after high school that I'm starting to get these self-esteem issues... 

Oh well, life is strange, hopefully I can work towards it slowly, it doesn't seem to come naturally to some people, which is sad. Me too. I have tried a few times to explain why but I just keep crying. These themes are definitely not something just kids in school or young people deal with.  You could tell from his high IQ Gabe, is that you? Those last moments were so heartbreaking. You could see how naive and misinformed she was about what really went down and it made me so sad seeing her feel like she did something wrong. Really heartbreaking to see her thinking it was in her best interest for no one to find out because of how he manipulated her I know, I liked that she was just a genuinely nice person who liked having a little friend she could guide. More people are like that in real life than movies would portray. I kept waiting for that to happen, and was really relieved when it didn’t. Having the truth or dare scene cut that relationship from the story was FAR more effective imo. I feel this comment so much. I was so scared that it was going to go that route, especially with how awkward Kayla was acting. I was bracing for it while they were at school, during the phone scene, and during the scene where they were at the mall. It's refreshing to actually have a clearly good-intentioned and candid character not backstab the audience. what'd you make of her wearing the DARE shirt? was she doing it ironically, or genuinely? also just realizing the foreshadowing of the car scene now.......ick Olivia is what convinces me this movie is optimistic. She is cute and has friends but she is almost as awkward as Kayla and mentions several times that she didn't have friends in eighth grade either so I like to imagine that in 4 year Kayla will be where Olivia is now.   I was so glad that she recognized that it would be an uncomfortable situation for Kayla to go home alone with the highschool guy. But then she didn't really put up a fight, which is a strong statement on how insidious stuff like that can be, even when you have the best intentions and are looking out for others. I think the fact that so many people were so ready for her to turn heel says a lot about how we view kids and their interactions. There are way more kids like her than we’re inclined to think. i'm in hs and that is legitimately how i talk to people in middle school/younger because i know how nervous they are to be around someone older and ""cooler"" than they are; that's exactly how i felt when i was them. Kayla saying she wanted a best friend when she had her dad all along. My heart. I love that part. She keeps her head down and doesn’t look at the girls even once but she’s still so proud of herself! Awesome scene  Was this the 5th grade Kayla or the 8th grade Kayla? I cried during that scene because I remember feeling exactly what she was feeling at that age towards my mother... :( I cried a lot at that scene. Both from relating to feelings Kayla was having and from wishing I had a dad more like hers when I was younger. Super late reply but this was the highlight of the movie for me. Having depression/anxiety I could relate to Kayla but also as a recent father I could relate to the Dad. Her dad was phenomenal, both acting and character.  Between that and her high school friend Olivia, this movie was so real that it was unpredictable. I was thinking ""Oh great, the typical I hate my father eighth grader"" Nope. And then I was sure Olivia was going to turn out to back stab Kayla. Nope. I even though Riley was going to turn out to be the next crush that she transitioned from middle school to high school with. Big Nope. When he approached her in the pool with, “wanna see me do a hand stand?” My husband almost lost it.  I know that’s exactly how my husband was in middle school, including the breath holding contest.   people like gabe are the best type of people imo, there's like no first conversation awkwardness with them because they just jump straight into it. no weird social mind games, just small trivial questions that spiral into a genuine connection. I was that kid incapable of swimming without a full mask on.  Gabe was too real. The moment her dad mentions how he took a note of it and pulled out his phone made my entire theater lose it. When she finally breaks and throws it at him I lost it. Reminded me of THAT scene from American Pie lmao She threw the entire banana!!! At her dad, Christoph Waltz!  When I saw it I was one of 2 other people in the theater. One was a girl around my age (early 20s) and the other was a guy in his 40's or 50's and that scene had him DYING. He was laughing for a good minute after the scene ended and the other girl and I couldnt help but keep laughing too. I kinda wish I had scene it with a bigger audience, hopefully I'll get that when I see it a 2nd time. she played the part like she was gonna barf so good I genuinely felt like she wasn't acting at times but rather just became the awkward, anxiety-ridden girl herself, encompassing the character in a way that just seemed so natural and fitting. Faking a speech impediment can be really hard but she absolutely nailed all the rhythms and inflections. The most impressive thing to me is that all those ""um""s, ""uh""s, ""like""s, ""blah""s, etc, were straight-up scripted. Elsie is just phenomenal.  Elsie was perfect for this role. Little tangent, but I just loved Kayla as a character in general. She was so easy to root for, and not just because she was an awkward, shy kid. She was *extremely* brave throughout the movie and I loved that about her! Even today i 100% would not have had the balls to go to a pool party of people i was unfamiliar with or tell off assholes who were rude to me like she did. So many other pieces just expect you to root for a character bc *ohh i'm so awkward and pathetic and helpless* but this movie actually gave her a great character outside of that. I loved every time someone stumbled over their words. You never see that happen in movies or TV unless it's to serve some purpose (eg some super embarrassing speech or something) when it happens all the time in real life. The principal, the dad, the kids, all stumbled over their words at some point. Contributed to the realness of it. I could definitely see Original Screenplay and Lead Actress for Elsie Fisher.      
      
As of now, I think they both deserve the win as I can't think of any 2018 movie that is better in those two categories.     
      
EDIT - I just checked [IndieWire's 2019 Oscar Odds](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/2019-oscars-best-original-screenplay-predictions-1201982087/) and it looks like Eighth Grade is listed as one of four ""Frontrunners"" for Original Screenplay if A24's past performance at the Oscars is any indication, I'm sure it'll get quite a few nods. 

personally betting on best picture, director, and original screenplay nominations, perhaps noms for Elsie Fisher as best actress and Josh Hamilton as supporting actor as well. someone screamed out OH GOD NO in the theater when he dabbed. He was a true hero. He was LIT. lmao that and that lebron james shit. i have an immature sense of humor i like that they highlight that she still has a long way to go growing up-wise. she doesn't magically understand the world at the end of the film. she doesn't abandon ""gucci"". she's still extremely unsure about her future. but you know that ultimately, she's gonna be okay. LeBRON JAAAAAMES!!! Some girls in the back of the theater I saw it at were all like “Gucci!” before Kayla finished the end of her last video.  I was the one person in the theater laughing at that every time she did that, it was just so random Gucci! Bo said in his AMA that he wanted to do a Lord of the Flies style movie about fifth graders at a laser tag party and I'm all for that. In reference to your critique of the fire scene, I was thinking the exact same thing, waiting for that Chalamet/Stuhlbarg moment. But while I absolutely love that scene from CMBYN, it is so clearly written, too perfectly articulated to be real. It worked for that movie but why I think the fire scene here was perfect was because it fit well in this movie. The father here was clearly speaking sincerely but he was fumbling over his words because that’s what happens in real life when an unexpected moment to connect comes up. He has some moments of clarity that really get across his point but  mostly he is just repeating himself and saying platitudes because that’s what real people do. To me this was a theme throughout the movie, so many scenes (the dinner with the boy at the end, the scene in the food court, the pool party) that felt very grounded in reality rather than movie tropes. 

I loved this movie  I’m of opposite thought class than you for the fire scene. 

One of my favorite parts of this movie was how well everyone did at SOUNDING NORMAL. Everyone speaks in a natural cadence, nothing overly scripted, and not afraid to even let the adults have misspeaks and flubs. 

The Dad had no idea how to talk to his daughter for the entire movie. It would’ve been completely  unrealistic for him to suddenly deliver a sage and masterful speech. He was just rambling, using the momentum, capitalizing on this rare and precious moment of attention and it came spilling out in a messy rant like it would in reality. 

I thought it was beautiful that there was less of a delivery there. I think she'll get nominated anyway I knew the mom liked her dad from the second she called her “yellow shirt” and then said “oh I know your dad!” (Which is so real b/c multiple parents of kids in my school ran around having affairs). Then when you hear the other dad being mean over just cake I was like ugh it was scary. And thinking to the point where Kayla’s dad told her that sometimes mean kids just have other problems, and you see that the popular girls mom is up in her face taking a million pictures and making her invite someone she doesn’t know to her party possibly to have an affair, and that the dad is an asshole  Pretty late to this thread. Just saw the movie tonight.  I just wanna point out that the mom and dad could still be divorced. It would make sense for him to be over there because it’s his daughter’s birthday party.  I was lucky enough to see the movie a couple of weeks ago, remind me of the smash cut you mentioned? I think it was so poignant having it be a wonderful, kind single father because as a girl when you grow up with positive male role models I think it’s all the more confusing when you end up in the car situation or when the boy you like demands nudes. Also, because as a girl there will almost always be a barrier between you and your dad that isn’t there as much with most moms. Like, I wouldn’t have told either of my parents about the car thing, but if I felt like I had to I could tell my mom. But not my dad b/c what can a dad do, he doesn’t know how that feels and he would probably go hunt that kids parents down and just make the practical situation so much worse. Some guy was commenting “she obviously told her dad, you see him barge in” and every single female commenter was like “she *absolutely* did not tell him”. Even my mom would not have told my dad if I had told her. But Kayla doesn’t have a mom so it’s that much more evident the weight of it on the dad  I think having Mark be single was a great choice just because it subtly speaks volumes with Kayla's anxiety, especially when it's realized in the fire pit scene. I don't think there's any inclination of what's happened to the mother until Mark says she left when Kayla was still a baby.

In doing that, it perfectly underlines the fears of acceptance that Kayla feels and stroked a mark that she might make her dad feel sad. Her own mother left and doesn't even feel the need to come to her daughter's middle school graduation. 

I really didn't connect to the middle school directly (though it's authentic from what I saw when I taught) since I had such a different experience, but Mark's speech afterwards is so frank, raw, and sincere that I broke down. It really made me want to one day be half the father to a little girl that he was in that scene.

Such a fantastically crafted scene. Her name tag from her day at High School https://imgur.com/a/XW4LvI1

For those curious. I missed all of this. Thanks so much! My favorite since The Social Network, and lo and behold:

""What I actually told [composer Anna Meredith] was that I wanted to sound like what it would be like if Trent Reznor was a thirteen year-old girl. Anna definitely tapped into that."" - [Bo Burnham](https://brieftake.com/interview-eighth-grade-bo-burnham/) love the soundtrack dissonance going on whenever we hear the badass Cliff Martinez-esque synth and we just see Aidan, this scrawny little kid that looks like a wet noodle. 😂 That's right, the music didn't happen the last time she saw him.  Clever piece of directing imo. I mean, maybe it’s not stylized narratively, but I thought it was incredibly stylized in editing and music and such. It was pretty over the top This is definitely the way to come out of the gate as a director. Burnham started on YouTube writing stories about how his whole family thought was gay and now he's directing really incredible films that capture the views of a modern 13 year old girl. That's such an amazing trajectory and I can't wait to see what he directs next. Yeah. Dont call the fbi but i know a lot of teens that age and...wow he got it like...dead on My brother and sister are currently that age and it was so weird seeing all the similarities. Also kind of relieving to see similarities to the middle school world I grew up in. Some things stay the same. I got to see a livestreamed Q&A with bo after I saw the movie last week - he specifically mentioned how much of himself he sees in Elsie Fisher and how similar they are.  > Also, it's clear based on his past work (especially what. and Make Happy) just how much of himself Bo put into Kayla's character, with the mismatch of what she's stating in her videos with how she actually acts in real life and even using those videos as a pep talk to herself.

This was such a great choice. I didn't pick up on it until the 2nd or 3rd video, but it was such a great way to allow the viewer (regardless of age/sex) to really put themselves into the mindset of an adolescent teenage girl.       
       
And it wasn't just that she was exclusively saying the opposite of what she was feeling/experiencing - there are a few moments where she seems to take her own advice (either before or after the fact), like when she decides to be brave and sing Karaoke at the party. >  mismatch of what she's stating in her videos with how she actually acts in real life

I totally missed that. Very good point though. I love how Bo's fingerprints are all over this movie. Maybe I just don't know enough writers & directors that I've missed out on connections between the film and creators before but this was produced a lot like Make Happy and I loved every second of it. >It's so rare to feel such a connection to a character.

The entire movie I just wanted to give her a hug and tell her that things would work out for her. Yeah, that was very realistic. She didn't have an articulate speech where she perfectly shot down the popular girls. Instead, it was fumbling, awkward, and probably didn't do much. All that matters was that she stood up for herself, and was proud of herself. When she went to YouTube I IMMEDIATELY got very excited. Still an excellent scene, but that would have been hysterical MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS ANGEL TOO LOL I think that was a legit YouTube search. I recognized Simple Pickup on there  > I’m just going to come out and say it: comedians are the most innovative and creative minds working in the film industry today

I'll go a step further. Comedians are the most innovative and creative minds, PERIOD. Full stop. It takes such a deep understanding of humanity to be able to make people laugh. No wonder they have the ability to elicit other strong emotions from people. Right after that scene, I heard someone in my theater crying and I suddenly felt a real connection with my fellow audience member. Then I realized they were laughing and I felt like shit. Very strange. Maybe uncomfortable laugh? Like the people who laughed in Hereditary. > and it made me feel ill

It's possible that they were terrible people but most likely they were uncomfortable and expressing it poorly.  The Darkest Hour 2: Slightly darker but still an hour. I'm 48.  I think it was tough because she didn't have a mother or sister to confide in and no really close friends.  When you are out in the open like that, you are so lost.  Her dad was doing his best to be that support for her, but she was constantly rejecting it.  It's like kids don't want support, they want confirmation and often, those are not the same thing.  I cried. Like, I almost had to leave the theater. It brought up some deeply repressed memories. I can remember the words used at the end of that scene being said to me almost verbatim when I was younger. 

Easily the best movie I’ve seen all year.  >horror

Joke? And the beginning one was about “being yourself” and at the end she stuck to being herself by making the video yh some girls do that.  And a signed Bring It On playbill. I knew we were in for a bad time when he dropped the girl off. I knew we were in for a terrible time when he got out of the car. 

I'm so glad the movie went there but also knew when to pull back.  If I ever had a son and I did what I consider my best in parenting and they still did that shit, I think I'd lose my god damn mind. Honestly though, Kayla is actually portrayed as having a huge amount of courage that a lot of people who can't relate to social anxiety will miss. Just going to the party, taking the microphone, calling Olivia, etc. It's going to go over a lot of heads how genuinely big those moments were in terms of internal conflicts.

I can relate to having to psych myself up to dial a number, even though I know it's going to be fine once the conversation starts. Fun facts I noticed on a rewatching of the movie:

1) In her new 8th grade time capsule are photo booth pictures of her with Olivia (99% sure)... Implying they must have gone up to the photo booth - the same one she hid from her dad in - after the food court and taken photos together. It's a nice thought that what happened on the drive back that night didn't keep her from wanting to remember her friendship with Olivia via her time capsule.

2) In her new 8th grade time capsule are *also* two nuggets sauce packs. Meaning she either went out of her way to (secretly?) take those home to remember her first ""friend hangout"" with Gabe, or he gave them to her to take home, cause that's just the kind of gentleman Gabe is.

Love the attention to detail in this film, in general. It's one of the perverse silver linings of the anxiety that Burnham suffers from: it also often comes with a side of perfectionism. I don't think I would constitute the scene in the car as a good day at all. leeeebron jjjjjames In real life kids don't treat it like a big deal. It was a contest at the local high schools in my area two or three years ago to see which guy could con the most girls into sending them topless snaps. Parents just swept it all under the rug. ""They didn't understand that it's blackmail and possession of child porn, they wouldn't have done it if they knew."" Yeah, I really enjoyed that bit too. I do appreciate how, even when doing that, she was still really awkward, and didn't go from 0 confidence to 100 overnight, but rather she simply started making an effort to be confident in earnest, like she suggested earlier in one of her vlogs.  Just got back from seeing this movie. It’s painful but so well done. 

If you need a friend, send me a message. No one should have to go without friends.  Future Club by Pertubator Vaginas, they come from vaginas. To me, it felt like a good version of Ladybird. More realistic, subtle, stronger themes, and much better directing (this was the most surprising part since Burnham is a relative newcomer.) I don't think social anxiety has ever been more accurately portrayed than with the scene at the pool party.

It was also hard to relate to Ladybird due to the protagonist being nearly sociopathic. I really liked 'Lady Bird', but 'Eighth Grade' felt so much more personal and intimate. > My critiques and they arent big ones but I assumed all the kids in my high school at least had some friends.

It's not uncommon. With social anxiety you can be friendly with a lot of people but find it very difficult to make the leap from friendly to friend. As a bullied kid, I’m glad to hear of your remorse and wish they all felt like you do, and I agree wholeheartedly that this should be required viewing. But you’re definitely wrong about all kids having some friends. I was friendless in middle school, and it wasn’t until high school that I found a group. The pool scene was quite funny imo.  Also, the change in music whenever she saw the guys she liked.  ""I charge my phone also"". After the movie I overheard some old lady saying ""he was just as uncomfortable as she was, you heard him say ""how do you think I feel wit my shirt off?"""". Intent of the scene went completely over her head. Not surprised someone perceived it to be humorous. Strange times.  I think thats honestly why I love it so much though. It’s unabashedly cringey and literally reminds me of when I was in middle school and high school and was worried about girls, fitting in, and being unbelievably embarrassed by your parents while still having love for them. Went even as far as making a viral video that aired on [Tosh.O](https://youtu.be/co_e1utDtqE).
I just love how relevant Bo made this film for today’s generation of teenagers and high schoolers  I hate to be a downer but I don't think she explicitly shared any of it with him. I think the fire scene *was* her beginning to open up to him: if she'd already told him about things she desperately wanted to keep secret, I don't think that moment would have been as impactful, either to the characters or narratively. > (this might be the first movie in about 48 movies I've seen this year that actually made me laugh out loud)



Did you see Game Night, Blockers or even Tag?

 >	she's a real brat to her father who tries real hard with her.

“Sometimes kids are mean to you but it’s not because they don’t like you. They just have other stuff going on in their lives.” Or something like that. The dad says it to her during their first dinner.  I had the SAME exact crowd experience as you, and it was just 8 people (4 couples) in the theatre. Was wondering if it felt similar in a packed house. for me, Bo Burnham's directorial debut is also comparable to Greta Gerwig's with Lady Bird last year. in the sense that neither film was like a cutting-edge revolutionary cinematic masterpiece, but they were both very well-rounded in writing, acting, and the overall ""feel"" of the coming-of-age genre that I think both Burnham and Gerwig have set great expectations for their future projects. My perspective as a 28 y/o is that kids still know better. I was in high school and a classmate went to jail over doing that with a 14 y/o and we all knew it was disgusting. 

In my experience, the boys who put me in those situations enjoyed doing it. I was invited to a “party” by a classmate and when I showed up expecting a party, it was just 5 older boys and no adults. One of them was a team captain. They offered me weed and alcohol and started trying to engage me in the truth or dare business until I snapped at them and told them they could just do stuff to each other. Then the pushiest one of them got upset and just said some vulgar “jokes” to put me in my place. I can’t imagine doing that to anyone at any time in life. I’m not sympathetic. The classmate called me from an unknown number months later and apologized, while I was sitting next to my dad in the car and I was just like uhhh I have nothing to say to you and hung up. And it does not stop in adulthood. They keep doing it. For life, some of them. Until you meet a mr. chicken nuggets 

Why I think it’s so important to make him seem normal is b/c that’s who does it. It’s not a boogeyman, it’s guys who seem otherwise normal sometimes  I have to a disagree a bit. I do think it was a little predatory. It's not as bad as if he was even older, but as a high schooler you kinda know not to go after middle schoolers. Middle schoolers are still legitimately kids. I agree with you about the arc of that scene. I wanted her to run when he joy out of the car.  You knew what was coming. He did the wrong thing over and over, including his ‘I was just trying to help you’ defensive bullshit,   But it was immaturity.  In the moment it was so hard for her, but I wonder what regrets he had, or may have coming down the road . Sad scene. I don't think it's really limited to kids of ""today"". I'm a nearly 30 year old man and I definitely related to a lot of Kayla's struggles. God, her hunched over, zero-self esteem posture was heartbreakingly real. I did the same thing all through grade-school and I'm sure even high school. When I saw the movie I thought the Gucci thing was ironic, it seemed like she was saying it sarcastically just to reflect on her old self and how stupid he saying was. But who knows for sure.

And yeah, it is a bit shocking how things are like that. I guess kids were always easily influenced, doing things to be in with the rest of the people their age.  > because I find it hard to believe she wouldn't have a single friend

I thought this was one of the most relatable and truthful parts to me. I loved how relatable the film was, even to me, a guy, and her loneliness was super relatable. I had almost no friends when I was her age, I had a cousin who was practically a sibling, so that kinda counted but it never felt much like it. Lots of kids are terribly awkward and the thing about 13 year olds is they aren't always terribly empathetic or nice, so I totally believe that she could go her whole middle school experience without friends. Yeah, it was really fucked up. And the way he was framing the whole thing as him doing her a favor. I was so nervous during this scene. The whole scene just gave me such anxiety and I wanted to kick that little scrawny kid's ass so badly. [I was so glad he didn't rape her in that car because that's where I thought it was headed](#spoiler) Play that oboe. So glad you saw this with your kid! I've been telling everyone to. I wish my parents had talked to me about this kind of stuff. i'm a teenager and i've had it instilled in me that if i'm uncomfortable, i am perfectly within my rights to say so and remove myself from the situation no questions asked, and that i'm not the one in the wrong. this scene kind of made me realize how many girls DON'T have that built in automatic response that i do and feel as though THEY'RE the ones who made things awkward and weird by saying no, which really scares me. i think it's really important that more parents have the conversation that you've had with your kid before they ever have the misfortune of ending up in a situation like kayla's. That made the scenes with Gabe even more emotional for me because he treated her with such kindness and respect, even if he was socially awkward about it all.  I know, it says so much about childhood innocence that SHE'S like, ""Please don't tell Olivia."" when you know the guy up front is internally panicking, thinking the exact same thing. I kept waiting for the twist where he was gonna day something really nice 

Nope

Just...nope Seriously, between this and Hereditary, A24 is making me increasingly uncomfortable with teenage boys driving cars with a younger female in the back seat. I liked how ""unending"" that scene felt bc that's how it feels for the girl who's in that situation When she ran into her room after that scene, some asshole started laughing and immediately got shut down by two other guys in the theater. No idea how any of that could possibly be funny. 

Edit:words The exact same thing happened at my theater. I don't understand how they could find something so horrifying, funny.  Absolutely. I went to a showing that had a Q&A with Bo afterward, and he pretty much said this—that it doesn’t have to be rape for it to be a horrible event in her life. I guess people said they were worried it was gonna escalate to that and that they were glad it didn’t, but he pointed out that it’s still a traumatic moment for Kayla. I really appreciated that. I was so proud of her for saying no, mainly because I DIDN'T in that situation and it tormented me all through high school. I wanted to strangle that kid when he said ""now your first hookup is going to be with some random guy at a party or something"" because that was almost verbatim what was said to me, and it caused me to cave.

Insanely good writing, to this day I didn't realize that this was an experience a lot of women had :/ you explained it best.  i just wanna say i really appreciate this comment. i went through my own ""uncomfortable and manipulative experience"" somewhat recently, and i sometimes feel like i'm just overreacting and should get over it. but reading this felt really validating and reassuring, so thank you.  Just watched it, you could hear all the women in the theater gasp *no* as he stopped the car. It was way too real. I had to leave the theater because of this scene and unfortunately didn't get to finish the movie. I had what I think was a panic attack outside of the theater, but I'm not totally sure because everything is just fuzzy.

When she said no and he started saying that he was just trying to help her, it was too much for me. I was in that exact situation so many times, only I was a nervous laugher so when I said no the boys ""thought I was kidding around"". The whole truth or dare part, the part where she says truth and he calls her boring, him saying now she'd have a shitty first time because she didn't let him ""help""... It was all EXACTLY what I experienced.

I wish I could have finished the movie. I'm happy someone depicted that situation so well.  Him trying to justify it as ""just trying to help you"" was the worst part.  There's been a lot of talk about it being Rated R and how the intended audience may not be able to see this movie because of that. 

Walking out of the theater a few weeks ago I couldn't help but think how necessary it is for kids to see that scene. In this #MeToo era, I think it's so important for boys and girls to see a situation that can actually happen to them, especially with how strongly Kayla handles it in the moment. Man, hard to watch isn't even the half of it. I have absolutely zero problem watching horror movies, gory movies, etc. - it's extremely rare that something makes me actually feel uneasy.

That scene, however; yeah, that did it. I don't think I've ever been that uncomfortable watching a movie before. My theater was packed, and you could just *feel* how uneasy everyone was. There was just this mix of uncomfortable laughter, involuntary noises, tense body language, and gasps that made it clear that everyone was feeling exactly how the director and writer intended. I really, really loved that she was strong and said no, but she was still traumatized.  THAT'S what happens, I don't feel like ""strong, independent person"" when I manage to escape situations like that.  It's not empowering.  It's devastating even if the worst didn't happen.

I'll never get over how Bo can portray things so perfectly.  There aren't enough words to explain what that's like to people but it seems like this scene really did it.  Absolutely. It's something so true and genuine yet movies never capture that well. Being just... invisible. You don't get bullied, just no one talks to you. I cried and felt a knot in my throat throught the movie. I completely related to it. Not so much anymore since starting college, but that was exactly what my high school experience was like I think that's a pretty genuine response as well. You first hear what she's saying and you just start saying comforting things, because you need to comfort her fast. So it comes out with just sort of generic platitudes. And then as you keep talking and you are starting to process everything better, you can dig a bit deeper. You can find the words you actually want to say, not the words that are easy to say. That was probably me Those were manly tears As soon as he got up to go to the back seat, I was like “Bo, you aren’t gonna hit me with a rape/assault scene are you?” Luckily it didn’t happen, but it was very uncomfortable and almost felt weirder than watching an actual rape scene.  Classic first date line. Get 'em Gabe. The hardest I've laughed at a movie in a looong time. *Immediately* followed by a lightsaber challenge with silverware I was just like ""Whoa, Gabe just coming out the gate with the heavy hitters."" You could see one of them in her updated time capsule, my heart just burst  ""I like ALL the sauces."" What's funny is the Rick and Morty bit is one of the few improv'd scenes, if the only one, in the movie. Burnham was pretty strict about the script. You can tell Fisher is definitely playing a little more herself and less Kayla there. Uh, he got 5 bullseyes. That's brilliant to separate them bc then it's still that awkward new feeling.  Bo is so awesome Damn that’s a great opening line. Oh hell yes I’m hyped It was six minutes, and he said he HOPED it would be in the blu ray. But yeah, I’m super stoked too! Gabe was amazing. 15 minutes?! Holy shit... I also like how Kayla's rude, spoiled classmate's mother is depicted as a friendly, kind person.  In most movies she would have been written to be unsympathetic. I thought he got up at 8 and picked it up The quick ""What's in the box?""-""My hopes and dreams"" exchange made everyone in my theatre laugh. The timing was great. He was concerned about the details which many kids these days don't.   ""If your chicken nuggets are a bit cold, I can heat them up for you"".   ""I didn't know what sauce you wanted to I got two of each""  Kids who are concerned about the details or empathetic are seen as weak and outcasts.  But they are the ones so concerned about others they don't have time to be selfish. Huh that’s funny. They must have thrown in the “no one uses Facebook anymore” line after the fact almost as a nod to them doing that.  It portrays how Bo Burnham feels, and *he's* a grown up superstar so... I think this is one of the achievements of the movie, the great portrayal of the anxiety and fears of that age that are a constant in our lives even as generations go by.

When Kayla goes to the mall with Olivia and her friends, one of the guys says ""She's wired differently"" because of the early use of modern social media, and that's what many people, especially adults, would think; this usually leads to mockery towards the next or the previous generations, and in movies or tv shows we often end up seeing parodied versions of reality.

And that's where I think this movie rise over many others: the social media, the different lifestyle and different means of communication are just a background to the real focus of the story, which is Kayla herself.

And that's why so many people ended up relating with her, even if they had her age in a very different time. /r/archery needs to sidebar this dude asap.  Rick and Morty reference. This movie did a good job of never getting *too* dark or cringey, which I appreciated. It managed to balance out the tougher to watch scenes with some fun or just plain nice scenes which felt all the better for it.  And I think it gets more like that with age. Like my high school was bigger and chiller than middle school. There are more issues with other types of things, but it’s more mature than middle school. Same for college vs high school  Yeah I loved how believable the wholesome parts were. Many teenagers really are just as shitty as the movie portrays (especially early on, many mellow in high school). But people like the older friend are common too, I feel like I've met people almost exactly like that girl. It was a nice balance. I was in the same boat. But I dropped my guard when they were in the food court and Olivia really defended Kayla for not being “wired different.” It made me think that she saw a lot of herself in Kayla. A great character that really helped the pacing of the story.  There was a scene where the high school girl was talking to her friend with Kayla crouching by them and eating toast or something? I'm not sure, but Kayla reaches for the plate where the other food is to dip what she's eating in ketchup I suppose, and the plate is just a bit too far out of her reach. The high school girl immediately notices and moves the plate toward Kayla.

That was when I thought ""Okay, I can drop my guard. She's genuine.""

And I know I'm replying to your almost 6 month old comment lol. Speaking of being glad something happen. I'm glad we didn't have to see Kayla get bullied from telling the kid she gave great blowjobs and had dirty pics for her future boyfriend on her phone. I think you're right. You can see hints of that in the compilation at the end of the movie as Kayla narrates her second time capsule video. you just made me realize the nice symmetry between her not looking at the girls when she calls them out and the girls not looking at her when she tries to be nice to them at school 8th grade Kayla, in her letter to 12th grade Kayla I don't know, there's the Sheldon Cooper side of people like that as well. Gabe has zero social skills and no maturity at all, there are 3rd graders who are more mature than him. It's funny to see in a movie, but how many people that age would actually want to hang out with someone immature enough to try to show off his inability to do a handstand in a pool?

I mean, his honesty and openness is refreshing if you've been getting a lack of that from other people. Gabe's probably going to mature and become a really good person, especially after Kayla helps him to relax and teaches him what kind of things are and aren't good topics of conversation.

He's perfect for Kayla in that moment though. No dishonesty, completely non-threatening, and she has nothing to lose and no fear of embarrassing herself when she's around him  I thought for a second I went the whole movie without realizing the Dad was Christoph Waltz I was listening to Bo and Elsie on a podcast yesterday and he joked with her when the began filming that if she felt nervous not to stress because its exactly what they're going for.      
      
But if you watch her in TV interviews now, she's much, much more collected and sure of herself than the character (thankfully for her sake). Although I guess that could have changed since they filmed it 2+years ago I can't even imagine what the opening scene looks like on a script page. I believe Bo said in his live q&a that he had Elsie read the script once and then riff on the general idea, giving the lines more sincerity in her delivery and character. Let’s hope it doesn’t get The Florida Project treatment and actually gets promoted by A24 come awards season. Maybe due to its unavoidable comparisons to Lady Bird, they’ll end up going all-in promoting Eighth Grade like they did with Lady Bird last year? I haven't stopped saying LeBron James like that kid did since walking out of the theater last night. It was too funny. What scared me the most is that the ""LEBRAWN JAMES"" meme is already FOUR years old.  Just like her dad said. He stopped worrying about her being okay a long time ago. We just didn’t know her as well as he did. I love how he kept popping up in random places lol. \*dabs\* I swear there has never been a more accurate portrayal of a middle school assembly. As somebody who left middle school four years ago, this shit ACTUALLY happened every single assembly. It felt like I was reliving it. At our Q&A Bo said he just told the kids to shout out something and even he didn't understand the joke Best character, wish he got a better conclusion. 👌🏼 Omg this would be hilarious. Or terrifying. Or both.

I need it. I think he said this as a joke.   > but mostly he is just repeating himself and saying platitudes because that’s what real people do.

I think this is a great explanation of why I loved this scene and the movie as a whole. It was so relentlessly authentic. This scene is a really great illustration of that. You're absolutely right, the CMBYN father speech is amazing and beautiful, but the one in this movie felt so real that it surpasses it for me. I think it works in CMBYN because of how erudite the father is and because of how he had clearly been mulling it over for a while.  If there is any movie character who could believably have given that speech, it's Michael Stuhlbarg's character Maybe the school shooting drill? I remember that being terrifyingly sudden. Yes!! Thank you for sharing this. I had thought the same thing. I wish more movies were brave enough to have a bold score like this one. The music even had a sense of humor, as evidenced in the banana scene and when Kayla would see her crush. That was really wonderful.  The sound and close up shots/lightining stood out to me. It was still stylish just more subtle the banana part was highly stylized. I immediately drew parallels from Kayla's video set-up to Bo's. His early videos are so low-fi.  reported The moment that sealed the deal for my was Aiden's first appearance when he's wearing the Warriors jersey. For some reason kids that age are obsessed with the Warriors. I don't know why, but it's true, and a kid like Aiden would 100% be wearing that jersey a couple times a week.  I think you’re spot on. Two incredibly tense car scenes (Hereditary and  this movie) that screwed with audience expectations and ratcheted up the tension= inappropriate laughter. 
 I had the same reaction because of a similar experience. When he got in the back seat of the car my stomach dropped. It was like it was happening to me all over again.

I hope to god some young girl sees this film and finds the courage to speak up and fight if it ever happens to her. Just taking you back to relatable social fears many of us felt - I’ve absolutely been that kid at the pool party, and I was scared for anyone who’s been the girl in the back of the car The truth or dare scene.

Hell, even the pool party had me fidgeting.  I really truly believe that kids with good parenting who don't have an extraordinary amount of external influence on them really don't do that shit. Teach your kids what's appropriate, raise hell against them when they don't from the very beginning. I'm not talking ""don't pressure girls into sex if they don't want it"" I'm talking ""I know you like Suzie but if she says she doesn't want to hold your hand then you don't touch her okay?"" AND it means ""no auntie Carol you don't get a kiss on the cheek, baby Joey said no and you don't get to kiss someone that doesn't want to be kissed.""  I just watched it and thought the same thing. No one way in hell would I ever had worked up the nerve to call the cool high school kid after shadowing them or even go that girl's birthday party. That's probably why I have no friends at age 30. Kayla was a very brave kid.  I thought Lady Bird did a better job of creating a world with multiple interesting characters I care about. And the relationship with her parents was more complex and realistic. And Lady Bird was funnier imo.

Eighth Grade did such a good job of really dropping you into her life though. Personal and intimate is exactly it.  Don’t forget Teen Titans Go! to the Movies. But all those movies you said got at least one big laugh out of me. There for sure were a few moments in the movie that I fleetingly thought, oh shit, this movie is too old for her - like the banana scene, masturbating kid in sex ed class lol, maybe the dirty photo folder scene. But those fears were quickly alleviated. The movie perfectly laid out so many topics you wouldn't think of to talk to your kids about. Loved loved loved it. Late reply, but I just saw this movie.

The thing I think Bo did so well in this scene is play with the idea of putting yourself out there. Her dad encouraged her to go to the pool party, to put herself out there, she makes a video about how it's good to be uncomfortable because that's how you grow. It shows just how hard it is for middle schoolers (or really anyone) to know, is this a good uncomfortable or a bad uncomfortable.

If that scene would've happened with Gabe, it could've come across as pleasantly, cringily relatable. Many people have fond memories of their awkward first sexual encounters with their peers that were *not* predatory. Both parties were kind of uncomfortable, but it was also exciting. And I'm sure from Kayla's perspective, this guy wasn't that much older than her, so it should be fine....until she realized that it really wasn't what she wanted. Gabe was the fucking best! Him telling kayla he was trying to do her a favor was sickening, it was so real how he was trying to damage control the situation. I wish it was just childhood innocence.  The manipulation just gets more slick, but it still happens in adulthood.  It's the same mechanism that makes people in abusive relationships or work places stay, they feel powerless, fear losing something, and it's generally subtle.

That scene gutted me.  All the more realistic, he was young too. You just gave a Letterboxd user the perfect list title. Just to tack on. I was also at a Q&A with him. He specifically said in mine that this scene was showing the violence of something as simple as ""nothing happened, they just talked"". 

 He gets it. Thanks for sharing! A had several early sexual experiences that I didn't really want, but just let happen. I didn't know how to say no, because I was so desperate to feel liked and wanted. So instead I told myself that I was promiscuous by choice, in an attempt to feel empowered by it. But the truth was that I felt gross and used.

I'm so sorry you had that experience. We talk about rape and assault, but I don't think we talk about these ""gray"" situations enough, and I was amazed to see it so well depicted on screen (and honestly, by a man). I grew up with all these movies where it was totally normal for a guy to convince or trick a girl into hooking up, and it was played as a joke. While this scene was hard to watch, it was refreshing to see this depicted from the other side, as something that could be really traumatic. Especially since she seems to feel so guilty over it Yeah, I almost feel like the movie should be required viewing for eighth graders for that scene alone. The occasional uses of ""fuck"" didn't help with the MPAA either That scene is great, but the blowjob talk, blowjob video, and dildo on a video earned that R rating imo. Parents want a say in their kids being exposed to that stuff so they can handle it themselves.

Whether they handle it well or not is another story, but I have no issue with them having what they think is control over it. I appreciated this scene (and against my better judgment, did not leave the theater and instead made myself watch it) for making me feel nervous and scared for a situation I’ve never found myself in. Like you hear about this kind of thing and you get sad and mad, like “that’s a super shitty thing, who the fuck would actually do that?” But watching that scene, I felt just as powerless as Kayla did and I loved that she stood up at the end. That was a frightening scene for sure and it’s definitely one I think people need to sit down through, to gain a better view on topics discussed in this #MeToo era yeah, it was horrible, i just kept loudly whispering ""NO NO NO GET OUT OF THE CAR KAYLA"" from the second olivia left. i just wanted her dad to come in and save her so badly, and i'm sure that's exactly how kayla felt too. 

side note: i found it weird that her dad didn't take her home though. i know she was mad at him for spying and everything but idk if i would trust random teens that i don't know to get my daughter home safely. i feel like if kayla ever told him about what happened that would be an immense source of guilt for him. I saw this movie in a group of 4 college aged males and we were all wrecked by that. This Gabe dude needs a spin off One of my favorite details in this movie is that there is no food there you can use silverware for. They just kind of wave them over the food. He just wanted an excuse to use the lightsaber forks. I missed that part!  That makes that scene all the better. Not that it really matters, but there's actually two! I just back and the only thing I did inbetween the film and hopping on here was call my little sister (who's 19 now) because it made me want to call and tell her I love you even though we communicate solely through snapchat (God damn did Bo nail media with kids). EQUALLY I read an interview with Burnham where he said  he was really loose with the script. He only let Elsie read it once, and said part of the magic of the script was the fact that Elsie just kinda knew what the scene should be like and had to freedoms to be more real in her speech.  I feel like she was definitely meant to have a little crush on Kayla’s dad. The look of disappointment when Kayla shows up at the door for the party alone, and her looking past Kayla out the door for him. And she didn’t seem fake about it at all, she seemed to genuinely care about children and that they had a good time at her daughters party.  And his expression immediately afterward of, ""What did I just help her do?!"" I also like how you don't really see him on his phone unlike the rest of the kids her age. He is more interested in what's going on here now (handstands in the pool, if she's comfortable/happy with her dinner).

Except for when he messages her on IG, but it's because they're not together and he's thinking of her. Which is an example of healthy technology use in this movie I guess? Yeah in Bo's interview on WTF he said exactly this lol Wow, yes. And after the first encounter when she was being nice to them, she had a little smile afterwards, proud of herself for being brave and relieved that it wasn’t horribly embarrassing. After the second encounter, that feeling is enhanced with a bigger smile. I was so proud of her lol Could've sworn I read or saw somewhere that she says she's actually very social in real life, so it was tough for her to get into this role at first. I got a little distracted in that scene just realising how *real* it felt! All of the ""uhms"" and ""like""s just instantly convinced me I was watching non-fiction, instead of a scripted drama.  Idk at my q&a he said every single one of the uhhs were scripted and she just knew her lines really well The Florida Project deserved so much more recognition. RIP.  The kid who would randomly quote that at every school function should win Best Supporting Actor. Got me every time. It’s gonna be LIT That teacher dabbing was *hysterical*, I almost couldn't stop laughing As a teacher who regularly attends assemblies of middle school performing arts students (chorus, band, orchestra), this feeling of wanting to be funny, unique, apathetic, and cool all at once was WAY TOO REAL.  I almost walked out on the movie because I’m still on summer vacation god damn it  Man, the LeBron James kid and the fact that Adrian was wearing a Warriors jersey in his first scene (I live in the midwest, nowhere near the Warriors; every basketball kid is *obsessed* with the Warriors for some reason), this movie just nailed it right off the bat. I felt like this was just a hidden camera Truman Show kind of thing in a real modern Middle School. I still want it Yeah that initially scared the shit out of me.  How bout those scenes where Kayla is staring at all her social media and we just see her eyes reflected on top of all the photoshopped internet stuff? There wasn't too much style, but just enough to remember certain parts. Same with the hilarious close ups of Aidan's eyes. The pool scene was definitely shot, down to the music, like a conventional horror film. It was totally intentional.  Ace move when he left his archery marksman certificate out ""on accident."" Hey its Gab!

Shit sorry, Gabe* I like all the sauces equally. chicken nuggets and french fries with a variety of dipping sauces. this kid knows the way to a girl's heart. That was the worst part. He made HER feel like it was HER fault. Im mad they didnt show him getting castrated but i get thats its real life and people just...get away with that shit Of course she does. Aside from all of the other stuff she has going on (e.g., desperately wanting to be brave and confident and make new friends), he's gaslighting her the whole time. Pernicious as fuck. One of local indie theatres in Seattle, The Ark Lodge, is advertising the movie along the lines of ""We know it's R. It shouldn't be. We think eighth grades should see Eighth Grade. We wont' card you"" Her Dad is highly imperfect, I really loved that about the movie. She doesn't get to be saved by Deus ex Paternas, she's gotta grow and make some mistakes, too. The conversation at the campfire showed just how similar the two of them are. He's doing the best he can, just like he's encouraging his daughter to do.  god Gabe was such a G That part is key. He doesn't want you to think you are inconveniencing him at all.  These two comments completely contradict one another. Who do we believe?! This is what he said he did at the Q&A I was at with him.  Oh yeah I remember noticing that.  It didn't really go anywhere with that, though. Hey, good catch. I didn't quite get what happened in that scene, I was thinking maybe she was looking to see if more people were there as if there hadn't been much of a turnout for the party, but that wasn't the case. I think you're probably spot-on. THERE ya go . . .a example of ""healthy usage"" of said technology.  Whereas many people will blame the tech, he's an example of the tech usage.  In other words, let's put the blame back on the people using it versus the actual tech.   I loved that. Perfect /r/fellowkids material. God bless middle school teachers!  My wife teaches 7th and she said the completely dejected teacher at the end shushing the lined up students was too real for her to handle.  The musical cue every time she was watching Aidan had me rolling every time. The first one with the eyes was definitely the best, just way too funny. The moment when she goes into the bathroom and is alone and has to make the decision to change and go to out there gave me real anxiety. I don't know that I would have been brave enough to do it. I would have found a cop out and left. It was terrifying. 

It helped me remember how important certain things are at that age. In that moment, walking into that pool is about the bravest thing she could have done. No, it's lame..

Edit: no, really, i think it's cool


No, it's not cool four months late but Gabe was smooth af And if they were cold, he’d go and heat ‘em up for you too, if you wanted.  At a Q&A I was at, the actress for Olivia said her favorite line was when Kayla said ""NO! Sorry"" because while it's cool that she said no, it's just as significant that she immediately said sorry. The whole seen felt so real, and that part put the nail in the coffin for me. Being a guy, I know how much dude's do this shit by making the girl feel at fault. It is sadly works a good amount of the time. This kind of stuff drives girls crazy making THEM think they're the ones at fault. Exactly, people do get away with it. We all saw it in high school, seniors hooking up w freshman. :/ That's awesome. Good for them. MPAA ratings are basically just guidelines for theaters to follow anyway, right? I don't think they could get in any kind of trouble for it I want to tell my 8th grade students to go see this. But I can already see the emails from parents/parent conferences bitching I would suggest this. All the while knowing their kids act way worse than anything this movie showed.  Believe in yourself It was pretty much a visual confirmation that even Kennedy's mom didn't want her at the party, just wanted to hang and talk with her dad. That's what I liked about the movie. All these little moments that are so true to life, but don't evolve into a full plot, just like in real life. In reality, not everything is Chekhov's Gun and has to be part of something bigger. Really gave the film a very natural feel. I just watched it and could tell she asked her as she walked in the door very inquisically, ""Where's your dad?"" and then you could see her face go to 'shoot, what a shame' look as she looked over Kayla's head with an ""Awww."" But it was still very friendly, she didn't seem like a 1 dimensional cruel caricature just using Kayla to get close to her dad. It all felt very natural. Even though the mom likely had ulterior motives, she still saw Kayla as a human being, and showed her kindness all the way through. How the hell do they put up with that everyday  ^good ^job That really stuck with me. Like I was so happy she snapped at him in that moment, and then so sad when she immediately placated him with a ""sorry."" Yup. MPAA is a voluntary system.  Oh, even from the beginning, the insistence that Kayla pass along to tell her Dad, ""Thanks!"" Nice catch! But Kennedy’s mom noticed that you couldn’t see Kayla in the picture taken at the pool party and asked her to come to the front. She still seemed nice I think if that was the case, she wouldn't have had Kayla move to the front for the picture.  I have NO idea, but I'm sure thankful for the people who do it.  She was fierce with that ""NO"". Almost crying thinking about it On a rewatch, I did notice that. I think maybe so Mark would see that she was at the party when posted on social media? 4D Chess ",0
71,"“i sent you a mold of my foot plz respond” The ""Saoirse Ronan moves to New York and has multiple love interests"" trilogy is now complete. I love how the past was shot with a warm filter, and the present a cool one so if you couldn't figure it out contextually you had a clear understanding of which was which! From Jo and Laurie’s fight - is the line that ends it: “and ill watch” from the novel? Boy did it destroy me This movie needs a Bob Odenkirk trigger warning.  When he just hops into the film all of a sudden about an hour and a half into it, it's a bit jarring.  My wife and I couldn't stop laughing at his mere presence, let alone the mutton chops. Beth was so weird and sweet. I loved her. It was great that she had a personality outside of being “The Sick One.” Loved the theme of money and ownership in regards to women. Loved how Greta Gerwig blended Louisa May Alcott’s own story into the film. Alcott never married. The film’s end showed that it was the ownership of her own book that truly fulfilled her. One of my favs of the year. Just commenting to say that “12 year old” Florence Pugh in Dutch braids surrounded by actual other 12 year olds made me laugh out loud at the ridiculous contrast. Other than that and Chamalamalamalet clearly not aging through the whole movie, i really enjoyed it.

Edit: I also missed the instructive and helpful marmee portrayed by Susan Sarandon. I worship Laura Dern, but I’m not convinced that she really did justice to the character. 

One scene of her saying she was “ashamed of her country” isn’t really comparable to “If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative, I fear that someday you might find yourself believing that’s all that you really are. Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish is the wonderful workings of your mind: Your humor, your kindness, and your moral courage. These are the things I cherish so in you. I so wish I could give my girls a more just world. But I know you’ll make it a better place.” I loved the whole movie but I have to say one of my all time favorite scenes I've ever seen on the big screen was the ""gentlemen's club"" scene where they are dressed as older men with the pipes. Genuinely hilarious and love that Laurie was hiding the whole time. The reveal that Bob Odenkirk plays their father is the fastest I’ve ever gone from crying to losing my shit in a movie. I think the most memorable scene of the movie for me is Amy's economical factor in choosing a husband monologue inside the painting workshop. It was a single take where the camera focuses and tracks with Pugh's face as she moves toward Laurie. The controlled delivery says so much, it adds a silent subtext to what was spoken. It conveys a woman in a time where it is un-lady-like to burst out how she really feels, yet the measured tone tells us so much more is hidden beneath the surface. Furthermore, her perfect articulation of the matter hints her intellect and how often she thinks about this unfair world, refining each time she is reminded that life, fate, and society have constantly placed her being second to someone else whether in being a sister of talent, a love interest, an artist, and a woman.

Edit: grammar and clarity The hard cut from Amy confessing that she loved Laurie to her 7 years prior sending him a mold of her feet is pretty much my entire dating life. THAT scene between Saoirse and Timothee was stunning. Thought the whole film was excellent but that scene...damn The ending was so meta with Jo writing a happily ever after for her protagonist, parallel with Louisa May Alcott being forced to write a romantic ending for her novel. ""Under the Umbrella"" is even the name of the last chapter in ""Little Women"", if my memory is correct. The flashbacks were a little confusing. Also, I was not convinced that Laurie was in love with Amy. He really wanted to be part of the March family and he was going to do so in any way he could. saoirse is fucking fire damn she can act. Holy crap a movie with over five A-List actors that is a solid film. I enjoyed it. Greta managed to turn a 500+ page book into a solid two and some change length movie. I love this movie so much. Just the kind of film you want to live in. I’ve seen it twice now and both times I found someone new to grab onto and follow emotionally. The first time I was fully into Jo’s journey, but the second time I was way more attuned to Amy (and also more cognizant of Beth). I can’t wait to go again and have another completely new experience (I also can’t wait to see this with an actual audience). 

Also, while the contrasting Christmas scenes absolutely destroyed me (the hold on Jo’s face is perfect), it hurt a lot more when Mr. Laurence is hovering outside his own mansion, afraid to go inside because he knows Beth won’t be there, and Jo offering to help go inside with him. This film does so well at carrying over what I liked most about Lady Bird: making me care about the side characters almost as much as the main characters. None of the Little Women are American actresses. 2 English, 1 Irish, and 1 Australian. 

I found that interesting at least since none of them sounded naturally American even Saoirse. We are just here to witness Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh’s careers. Jesus those two can act. YOU WILL BE BORED OF HIM IN 2 YEARS BUT WE WILL BE INTERESTING FOREVER!!! My girlfriend forced me to go, no regrets. I cried at least twice. Don’t tell anyone. I’m a little confused by the meta ending. 

It’s frustrating because I personally love Friedrich Bhaer’s character in the book because I believe he propels Jo to become a writer of passion rather than just profit.

**But** what exactly does Jo and Friedrich’s ending imply in this adaptation? 😕 Non-linear structure was a fresh way to engage with this story.  Such a great choice. LADY BIRD WAS NOT A FLUKE. My poor 15 year old brother liked the movie much more than I believed he would, but he just told me he didn’t realize the story was non-linear.  I asked, and he didn’t question how Beth had died in one scene and then moments later she was talking to her sisters.  He DEFINITELY didn’t pick up on the changing color palettes, bless his heart.

Other than my brother’s absent-mindedness, (I am in no way blaming the movie for his entire lack of awareness) I truly loved this movie. Certainly one of my favorites this year. Absolutely perfect reimagining by Greta Gerwig. The way she brings Amy into her own is so impressive. Took her from my most hated character to a sympathetic one Loved it! Am I the only one who hadn't read the book and came out thinking Beth was the youngest of the four though? Totally random but I couldn't stop thinking how Emma Watson's American accent has improved so much since Perks of Being a Wallflower! Just a delightful movie all around. The cast had such great chemistry — the four core sisters in particular. I was a little jarred by the bouncing back and forth in time on this first viewing, but I think the effect was great by the end. 

Now gotta go read the book. Overall, I think this is the best adaption of Alcott’s novel but it was jarring to see the story being told out of chronological order.  I arrived two minutes late and believed that I had walked into the wrong screening halfway through the film. 

Saoirse earned an Oscar nom if not a win. 

Florence is an excellent actress but the scenes where she played young Amy were surreal. The scene where she’s  in class with actual 11 year old girls was jarring. She just looked like a 20+ year old woman with the mind of a child. It was such a strange choice not to do double casting like the 1990s version. Now, these little women. How little are they? I mean, are they, like, scary little? This is Florence Pugh’s year and this movie just reaffirms that. She’s so phenomenal as Amy — a character who should be entirely a brat, but also loves deeply and has incredible independence of her own.

I particularly loved the ending, where Jo is talking to the publisher and they discuss the ending of her book. It’s so meta, but also romantic (both in the classical sense and emotional sense.) Jo realizes that she can be who she wants and be with who she wants to be with without detriment to her story. Really enjoyed the movie, but the only thing that pulled me out of the immersion was the discovery Beths passing, I know they wanted to mirror the first time she was sick but there’s no way the family found out, grieved, and removed the body  all while jo was sleeping in a chair off to the side It's unprecedented how extraordinary films like this both exist and make you feel. I'm a mid-20's male and I connected so deeply with Jo's character, how she didn't want anyone to be ""taken"" from her, how she wanted more to ""be loved"" than to love, and how her hobbies trumped her social/love life. Fuck, man.

I was drowning in my emotions for most of it.

I've said this before and it applies here more than ever and always will: Florence Pugh is immaculate. She stole every scene she was in. People are talking about the Saoirse+Timothee scene, but BOTH Florence+Timothee scenes (inside the paint shop and outside when she confesses to him) were *incredible*.

Also, fuck the obnoxious woman in my theater who screamed ""WHAT?!"" when Amy admitted she had always loved Laurie, and then later screamed ""NOOOO!"" when they kissed. Hello 911, I would like to report a robbery. Florence Pugh has stolen every single scene in Little Women, and she must be stopped!!!! Anyone else think Emma Watson did a really great job as Meg? Maybe it was simply the writing, but this was the first time I felt she was a truly fleshed-out  character and I liked the peeks into her married life. [deleted] I think this film touched my heart like no other movie this year and I think that’s because it’s just a genuine love story. I adored Florence Pugh’s performance as Amy and think Saoirse Ronan absolutely killed it as Jo. Absolutely one of my favorites of the year. Just saw this today and I’m torn. While it looked gorgeous and featured some truly phenomenal performances, I think Greta Gerwig made a few artistic choices that prevented this adaptation from reaching its full potential.


1) The first act felt very disjointed. This might’ve been because it took me awhile to adjust to the nonlinear narrative, but I also felt that scenes within the same timeline transitioned from one to another jarringly and without any sense of flow. 


2) Bob Odenkirk and (to a lesser degree) Laura Dern felt miscast, which took me out of the movie.


3) Gerwig should’ve chosen older actresses to play Florence Pugh’s classmates in the schoolhouse scene, because the obvious disparity between Pugh and the literal children surrounding her looked ridiculous.


4) Dern declaring that she hated her country came out of nowhere. In fact, I feel like that whole scene could’ve been cut out.


5) Meryl Streep’s character felt underdeveloped.


6) I just don’t buy Timothee Chalamet being as old as his character seemed to be by the end of the film.


7) Beth’s death scene was powerful, but I don’t understand how Beth could’ve died and been taken from her room without Ronan waking up at her bedside.


All things considered, I deeply enjoyed this film, I wish I enjoyed it more than I did, if that makes any sense. [deleted] I thought the plot twist of them all being regular sized women was bold, but worked. The thing that separates Greta Gerwig movies from other similar movies is the care she puts into every person. In both this and Lady Bird, the details she gives to minor, relatively unimportant characters are what makes the film (like the conversation between the publisher and his wife, or the scene at the end with Mr. Laurence and Jo) I don't normally go for period films or classic literature, it's just not typically something I would go see, but I loved this movie. The film is funny and heartbreaking. The cast is fire. Saoirse Ronan could read the ingredients off a cereal box and make it engaging. Florence Pugh is also quickly becoming a must-see for me. Definitely in my top five for the year. I am a bit torn about the ending. I appreciate the creativity that went into mixing Alcott’s real life with the movie - but I wanted to see the actual Jo-Bhaer trajectory than the “fake” scene we got. 
Each scene was done and acted beautifully, but I felt that having a non linear timeline reduced the emotional impact that comes from continuity. (Jo-Laurie proposal, Beth’s death). Florence Pugh was great as Amy. So good. Glad to see Gerwig didn’t just stumble into a perfect story for her with Lady Bird. Doing a classic period piece like this really helps legitimize her as a director and writer. So excited to see what she’s got ahead of her I adored it and had a lot of thoughts, which I've shared on social media, but I did have one thought that I really can't share on any platform where I'm identifiable...


Louis Garrel as the Professor had an incredibly strong cunnilingus energy. I have never thought this about anyone in my life, ever, but as soon as he appeared on the screen my brain immediately said: ""oh yeah, he'd go down on you"". Maybe that's why so many people have been saying they are finally ok about Jo ending up with him? Emma Watson finally in another good movie? 

After all this time. I don’t know if this has been asked, but does anybody know why when Friedrich Bhaer, Mr. Dashwood, and Jo we’re all writing letters they talked straight to the camera? I found those parts a bit jarring.

Also, upon second and third viewings a couple of little things stood out:

1. Jo was ambidextrous (you see her switch hands in a couple of scenes when she is writing, I thought that was a nice little touch)
2. Right before Beth dies when her and Jo are lying in bed you can hear the waves go out (earlier at the sea Beth talks about how she is like a wave, she goes out slowly but will go out—or something to that sentiment)
3. Marmie is wearing the same outfit when Beth dies and gets better (not sure what this represents, maybe nostalgia and always remembering your parents the same way?)

ETA: Just found out through an [interview](https://youtu.be/Z-4Ahn6lV-Y) (starts at 16:30) that Greta was inspired by filmmaker François Truffaut and that she got the letter reading idea from his film Two English Girls. Emma Watson was great here, and anyone who was viewing this fairly could see that. She literally got the character perfectly and was perfectly on par with the rest of the cast and had great chemistry with them. The only reason anyone singles her out is because they never liked her to begin with, and just see her as a punching bag, especially considering who she's surrounded by here.

A lot of people just have a bone to pick with her, and were never gonna give her a real shot to begin with. A lot of people were just gonna dislike her and say she was bad in this no matter how well she. She did a great job in this, and anyone looking past their preconceptions on her and the hivemind could see that. The actual reviews that clearly were looking at it fairly and not just because of their past bias against her as an actor gave actual good reason why she was great in this, and detailed how well she got the character and the warmth she lent to the character, but there are a few people that just hate on her no matter what and just see her as an obvious target of ridicule here. Chalamet is either going to be the greatest actor of his generation or he’s going to die in 3 years. I really don’t see any other outcome. The choices he makes in this are just mind blowing. Like how the fuck do you emote that much without moving your face at all. It’s just wow Controversial maybe, but I enjoyed the flashback setup. To me, it was a way to relearn the classic story. I found myself more invested in their childhood due to the fact that you could actually see how it affected their adult life. There was the “Daisy” scene for Meg right as she and John have the argument about finances because she’s still struggling with putting up appearances, and this, to me at least, really emphasized that their childhood wasn’t just there for nostalgia, but as reminders of who they are at their core. 

Beth killed me with her one liners. Florence Pugh was a wonderful Amy, the scene with her and Laurie in which he tells her not to marry her intended match was gut wrenching. 

I appreciate the nod to Alcott’s life, but as somebody who loved the ‘94 version and romance, it was not only jarring, but a bit disappointing. I did like the straight on shots, wish it had been done with more characters so it was less jarring when it did happen. One of the most interesting scenes in this movie was Laurie’s proposal. TC and SR really knocked it out of the park. Laurie and Jo were both fighting for their friendships in different ways during changing times. Laurie wanted to seal their friendship together as a couple. Jo naively wanted their friendship to always remain the same. Laurie’s last line was heart breaking and all too relatable. Yet what made this scene so incredible was the wooded New England hills and the golden sunset sky. I think it’s genius to complement the two together in this way. The warmth that it gave to something so heart wrenching adds a layer of subversion to it. It’s sad, but it’s beautiful and even majestic. Yet, the setting of the sun conveys an end of an era. This turning point decision not only impacted their lives personally, but as we can see, it also reached into the lives of everyone else they’re related to.

Jo lingering afterward was all of us. I don’t think anyone of us wanted their childhood to end. I adored this adaptation. I was a little confused at the beginning, but I think the movie found it's rhythm when the childhood plotline started. I just really love how familial the cast was with each other. I loved how they wrestled, argued, played, and laughed together like a true family. And >!my heart freaking broke when they mirrored Jo waking up in the present by Beth's bedside, only to go downstairs and find her mom sobbing!<

And I think they did a pretty good job turning Florence Pugh from 12 to 20. When the time went back-and-forth I kept trying to figure out what kind of makeup trick they were doing to make her go from youthful to lady. I really loved it, though I wish I had known Bob Odenkirk was the father. I'm too used to him comedically and him suddenly appearing took me slightly out of an otherwise moving scene. Loved this. The ending is genius. The ensemble are terrific. Techs great. Greta is such an exciting filmmaker.

My favorite performances were Ronan and Chalamet. His best performance since he broke out, not to be underestimated as just the charming love interest. I love Emma Watson as a person, but I don’t think she’s much of a natural actor. Especially next to Ronan and Pugh, she just doesn’t bring the same level of talent.


Edit: Oh, god. What have I done. The only thing I’m not sure of is whether or not the flashbacks suit this story or not. I didn’t hate that aspect of it, I just don’t know if it was necessary (though I will say that showing Amy saying she loves him, and then cutting to her making a mould of her foot for him as a kid is perfect).

My biggest issue with the story has always been that I don’t particularly like Jo and I *love* Amy, and so I was really happy with Florence Pugh as Amy in this. I’m always like, go back to Amy, show us her again! And I just really liked her performance. Timothée’s as well. Emma Watson was better than I thought she would be. 

I really enjoyed it, honestly. I really liked it. The showing I went to this afternoon was sold out (so were a few others across the city) and got a round of applause at the end, so! I think people will like it.

(I also saw 1917 this morning, and so I have had a pretty good day, film-wise) [deleted] All the comments in the thread make me feel like I read a different Little Women from everyone else.

I always felt Laurie’s love for Amy was genuine and the transition from being miserable about Jo to falling for Amy was organic. Yet everyone here is like “he doesn’t actually love her he still loves Jo”. Not a surprise that I can’t find anyone who felt the same about the added relationship triangle (?) either. I loved that in the book Jo shot Laurie down and never looked back. She could feel lonely - it’s perfectly natural - but the professor should be the one she thought about, which could also make her happy ending better. And I don’t really like Amy being a lovesick kid. She’s always been my favourite and I loved how stern and even cold she could be. Amy never showed romantic interest towards Laurie as a little girl. I’d prefer her conflict coming from always wanting to be included but being left out by Jo. She and Laurie falling in love by changing each other for the better, one about not marrying for money and one about contributing to society, was my favourite part of the book, but now it’s just background. Amy’s character, tho, needs to grow from being a spoiled child to a young woman and when you have two different actresses portray her you see her become a young a woman and you realize she’s no longer a child. Pugh being a 24 year old woman playing a 12 year old little girl is just very uncomfy to see Chalamet gave a good performance as Laurie but he was distractingly thin. I mean if the “camera adds 10 lbs” he must be positively gaunt in real life. I hope it’s just his body type and his rising stardom isn’t causing other problems in his life. I thought it was just me but my husband mentioned it. Watched it today and having seen the 1994 version and the 2017 Masterpiece miniseries, I can definitely say this one's my favorite! I loved the way Laurie and Amy's relationship actually evolved, and the fact that it didn't just happen out of nowhere like in the other versions.

I also think that leaving Jo's and Professor Bhaer's fate open ended so that the viewer could decide if she actually married him (or if it was just the ending she had to give her book) was very smart. It actually made sense, given the fact that Jo had been very adamant about being a wife and giving up her freedom. Laurie was an ass.  Not sure why Amy would marry him instead of Fred. The perfect adaptation doesn't exis... Enter Greta Gerwig! 

I finished the novel in 3 days right before seeing this film. And what can I say? It's a masterfully adapted script! The non-linear structure shouldn't work for this story but it really did under the direction of Greta. And the emotional impact is maximized. Holy shit did the tears stream down my cheeks multiple times throughout the film. 

Oh, and the girls are wonderfully acted. The four actresses are perfectly cast. They really brought Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy to life. 

What a fantastic film! I love it so much! Wow, the actors all gave stellar performances. Standout was of course Saoirse Ronan. The relationship between the sisters, especially the conflicts throughout the years between Jo and Amy really made me emotional! Even though the sisters would hurt each other with their actions and etc, the sisterly love triumphs it all. The whole theater was sniffling! 

One of my questions leaving the film was, did Laurie really love Amy? And I think the conclusion I came to was that it might be the dilemma that Jo was going through when she wanted Laurie back. The idea that wanting to be loved and being in love are not the same.  I think Laurie was lonely and wanted to be loved, similar to Jo. And Amy was able to provide that for him. 

Jo’s change between the way she was with Laurie vs. Frederick also showed she was in love, she found her happy ending (: 

Very well told story, and would engage viewers that have never read the novel as well! I was the only person who laughed at anything in this film at my showing... Am I the odd one out or were people missing the jokes? The ending of Jo chasing and finding Friedrich was fantasy, right? Please tell me it was. All of them convincing her to go after him felt so forced. Because i never watch or heard of Little Women before this movie so I didn't have any expectation and not knowing what going to happen

Beth death is so devastating, fuck I already cry and emotional before that point but those scene broke me I am very disappointed in this version of the movie. Probably because I came of age watching the 1994 version.

I think it was miscast. It's hard to tell the age difference between the sisters, they literally all look the same age. This is especially an issue with Amy- the actress who plays her basically seems the same age as the other 3 girls, but I think she's supposed to be like 12.

I feel like key moments in the film that felt SO dramatic and raw and emotional in the 1994 film just didn't have the same oomph in this version.

The jumps from past to present are confusing.

I know this is part of the book, but it feels weird for Laurie and Amy to get together.

I also don't remember if this was similar in the 1994 version, but it feels like a pretty damn charmed world considering a lot of the narrative supposedly takes place while THE COUNTRY IS AT WAR.

Overall, really not a fan. Am I the only one who didnt find Laurie (timothee) character to be that likeable?  He just seemed to want a lot which in a film that kept talking about how little women (no pun) get in the world in comparison, made him seem even a bit more greedy.  If not one sister, then another.  Gets drunk and acts out when he wants to or doesn't show up when he said he would to go with to the party Little women 1994 vs 2019

I loved them both and wondered how others thought they compared


Better in 1994
1. Beth! I cried when she kicked the bucket
2. Mrs March
3. Over all tone (much more joyful)
4. Felt more grounded in the time period


Better in 2019 
We actually got to know:
- Meg  
- Amy (I no longer hate her for getting what should have been jo’s)
- Aunt March 
- Jo’s handsome man


Debatable:
1. Laurie  
1994 Christian bale Laurie is sexier. So confusing when Jo turns  him down.
2019 Timothy Chalamet has better chemistry for being dumped by Jo and picked up by amy. 
2. Jo -  love them both for different reasons Florence Pugh is a damn star. With this and Midsommar, I can’t wait for Black Widow & whatever else she does Just watched this movie, and it's the first time I've ever experienced the story of Little Women.

Overall it was quite well made (the production designer was definitely the true hero), but the whole thing lives and dies on Florence Pugh's Amy IMHO. As a child she's so jarring and distracting, but then as an adult she absolutely steals the show and elevates it to something of a standout in the genre.

I think Gerwig's biggest weakness is in underdeveloping young Amy and old Meg, and thus creating what feels like a slightly imbalanced narrative on both sides of the timeskip. hi everyone idk where to gobut i just finished watching it and can’t stop crying??? i’m so sad about laurie and jo???? i really wanted them to end up together:( i’ve never read the books or seen any other adaptation so i’m just heartbroken they didn’t end up together 😭 he had so much more chemistry with jo, him and amy were so rushed Did anyone begin laughing hard when Amy said ""I'm making a mould to remind Laurie what nice feet I have"" or was it just me? I definitely liked this movie, but oddly I have mostly negative comments. Maybe I just like the story enough.

I'm not sure about Chalamet as Laurie. He's got very impressive screen presence and he's a good physical actor but he's not warm enough for Laurie. They were going for androgyny, so he works in that sense, but that's not how I picture Laurie. I don't picture Christian Bale either, so I'm not sure who I'd cast. Someone too old to play Gilbert Blythe, probably. 

The nonlinear timeline was necessary for the Under the Umbrella sequence to work, so I get it, but I thought it hamstrung some of the emotional beats. To have Laurie screaming at Jo he loves her then kissing adult Amy in the next scene didn't work. 

I liked the scene where married Laurie and Jo talk alone in the attic, that was a really nice inclusion compared to 1994. The best version of Little a Women hands down. 

This will go down as the definitive version until another adaptation can top it Pugh felt like a step above everyone else in the movie It strays too far away from the source material. Jo while being the main character, feels over shadowed by Amy. Amy is described as someone who is rude, materialistic, and able to advance within society not because she is honest, but it is because she understand people and acts how she believes they want her to. She isn’t a bad person by any means, but this movie feels like a redemption story for Amy more than a true portrayal of the classic novel. Furthermore the story between her and Laurie is romanticized, it’s stated that while he falls in love with her eventually, he decides to propose because if he can’t have one sister, he’ll be happy with another. The actress playing Amy does so beautifully, but she is definitely not 12 or 16 the age the character is in the book. That leads me to Jo who seems weak in the movie. She isn’t a strong headed and confident as she is in the novel. This is seen with the letter she writes to Laurie and her reaction to the marriage. She’s happy for him in the book, excited that her best friend is now her brother. In the movie it looks as if she was about to cry. Don’t get me wrong the movie is beautiful to watch, but it feels like a completely different story. So Aunt March did love Jo, right? Are we to assume that she left Jo her estate because she thought Jo would never marry? when they wear wearing wreaths near the end I could only think of Midsommar Full disclosure, I walked into this film not knowing anything about the book or adaptations. 

This movie was so sweet and sensitive. The sisterhood love was palpable and made me smile from my seat. All of the sisters were a unit while also maintaining their own personalities. They all lived vastly different lives and all held different world views through out. However, what brought them together was, of course, their love of family. This was beautifully shown throughout the film. 

Now to more technical aspects. The writing was sublime. Some lines hit with a firmness and eloquence that is reminiscent of actors on the stage. Humor was sprinkled with the same care that the heart ache was. They lived in parallel. This is obviously evident because of the two time lines, but this also bled into individual conversations and scenes. 

The acting was terrific. Lauren Durn has really become a big time actress since Renata on “Big Little Lies.” Timothy played his role, however it was Florence Pugh who blew me away. Every scene she lead was masterclass and left me feeling either elated or gutted. Bravo. 

The two parallel scenes of Jo waking up and going to the kitchen was genius and really the crown jewel of the film. As well, Meg talking with her husband at the table served as one of the more real scenes. She chose a life that was not filled with glamour so that she could be with someone she truly loved. That sacrifice was a major theme and that scene encapsulated it. Overall this movie deserves a lot of love, and perhaps with a more sensitive academy could take home some big awards. This is the first movie that made me cry in A LONG TIME. Not even sure why. I'm not a crier. It's not like it's THAT much sadder than other flicks that I've seen. Guess there's just something that struck a cord with me here. I wonder what would’ve happened if the ending stayed true to what really happened to Alcott and Jo never got married. Would people have hated the ending? Why do I wanna see Jo getting married? It did make me feel warm and fuzzy, but also seeing her never get married and just follow her passion of writing would make me warm and fuzzy too Anyone else get bad vibes when Amy was dancing around in a flower crown at Meg’s wedding? I got goosebumps for a sec with that Midsommar PTSD lol just saw this last night, i have never seen the older versions or read the book (yet) so this was my introduction into this story and the characters. there's a few things i wish were done differently:

I love Flourence Pugh and think she was a good Amy but i wish they hired a younger actress for the scenes were she was supposed to be 12. My friend who read the book went to see this with me and had to tell me that Amy was supposed to be the younger sister, or else i wouldnt have known. She genuinely looks older than Jo and her acting like a 12 year old just didn't feel right.

maybe this one is just because i havent read the book yet but i wasnt a fan of the non linear time line, it was super confusing and i felt like it made the story less emotional. 

other than that i really really liked the movie and now im going to watch the 90's version and read the book! 35yo (Chinese-American) female. Saw this twice. I've never read the book, but I grew up watching the '94 version and cherish it. I was really hyped to see this movie because the acting seemed amazing and the clips showed some really powerful scenes. After the first viewing, I honestly felt a little let down. It seemed the best parts (""Women..they have minds!"" ""Marriage IS an economic proposition,"" ""I love you, Jo!"") were what was already shown in the trailers, and especially the Laurie proposal scene felt like it went from zero to yelling really fast. There were some slow parts where I think the minutes could have been used to extend the sisters' stories. I agree also with some people that young Amy looked and sounded too old for the character, but other than that, the all the acting was wonderful. I thought each sister's character arc was given good development. I could relate to each one of these women. I had no problem tracking with the non-linear storyline.

BUT my biggest regret is that Friedrich Bhaer and Jo's relationship wasn't developed more. The last personal conversation they had together was in NY and ended with her rejecting his friendship because he hurt her feelings. The movie just needed ONE more line from him at that point - something as simple as, ""Write what's important to you,"" or ""write from your heart..."". The '94 version enriched their friendship wonderfully with that impactful scene where Jo asked Bhaer's opinion and he gave an honest one, but also encouraged her to do better because he knows she could. This spirit of support was missing from Gerwig's movie and prevented me from cheering them on in the end when Jo chases after him. I wasn't convinced the ""love"" was based on anything substantial due to the loss of opportunity to grow their relationship this movie doesn't take.

As for the ambiguous ending, I say, why can't Jo have her cake and eat it too? The inheritance of the house was real...and Jo did say she planned to start a school with it, as well as write a novel about her life. So, why couldn't it be both? Start a school AND get a book published, AND be dating Prof. Bhaer (not necessarily married)? No, Jo doesn't need to be married to be successful/fulfilled, but if there's a guy who loves and supports and inspires her, why not get married? She's allowed to change her mind. That is life.  I think her tearful conversation with Marmee about being so lonely shows that she's understanding that as she gets older and things around her change, she must also grow and change. 

Upon a second viewing (just today), after having a week to process the movie and think through my issues with it, I have to say I enjoyed it very much. I mean, I enjoyed it the first time too. It was an artsy, unique take on the story, with many zinger lines and scenes, and though I think the '94 version is still more enjoyable over all, I could watch this version more than a few times too. There's so much to take in and analyze, and FEEL in this precious story of the four March sisters. Bonus comment: One of my favorite scenes is after the 3 remaining sisters leave Aunt March's empty house, talking about what makes the human experience important - is it that writing about something makes it important, or that the thing is already important and writing about it validates its importance? (I think it's both). The reality that Beth is gone is palpable in this scene, but it was such a sweet minute of connecting between the now grown-up sisters who've gone through so much together. Extra bonus: ""Life is too short to stay angry at your sisters."" Perfect line. It was a perfect cinematic experience for me. I am a 23 year old man and I am not ashamed to say that I cried both happy tears and sad tears. I am so happy that my friend, she's read the book and agrees that the film was wonderful, suggested we go!

I think Little Women and Knives Out are the most aesthetically pleasing, and well written, films I've seen in a while. I'd hate to put so much on Saoirse at such young age, but at this point I'm now convinced it'll only take 10-15 years before she's genuinely put in the Meryl Streep category of actresses. 

In terms of accolades she's been on the right path but she just never stops improving and delivering. 

Again, it's unfair to hold her to such a high standard for a career, but I genuinely feel she will live up.

And major kudos all around. A fantastic ensemble was cast and they all delivered. What an amazing joyful and emotional journey. For me, a top 5 of they year. Very excited to see more of Gerwig directing and writing Am I the only one who felt no chemistry between Timothee Chalamet and Florence Pugh So somehow at 27 I’d never seen nor read any version of Little Women until seeing this movie and had absolutely no idea what it was about except that Beth dies (thanks Friends). 

That being said, I loved it. Loved how it was filmed, loved the cast and the writing. 

I noticed the color grading differences between the childhood scenes and the adult scenes and honestly initially just thought it was to show how drab adulthood was compared to childhood. But towards the end when the only adult scenes with the warmer coloring were the fake train station scene and the picnic with the family I thought maybe I was thinking of it backwards. Maybe the warmer childhood scenes were meant to highlight how flawed our memories of our childhoods actually are when looked at through nostalgic glasses. Like I said, haven’t read the book so I don’t know if this is a common interpretation, but I thought it was pretty cool. Even with Jo and her ever changing hair length I have trouble following the time skips Saying this as a 24 year old male with no sisters or platonic female friends, after seeing this film last night, I wish I was a girl with 3 sisters who had their childhood. It looked so manic and fun with the plays they'd put on and the dynamic each of them had in the film. 

It felt like watching Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood where it was just a great time at the cinema, enjoying seeing the characters getting fleshed out as it progresses, instead of a plot per se. I think my favourite scene was when Jo and Laurie dance outside the house party, couldn't keep a grin off my face.

Saiorse Ronan is just such a talent, I'll watch anything she's in now. Florence's Amy was a delight as well, even if she was the worst of the four for burning Jo's book. I loved how she looked up to Jo for her approval in a few scenes, first putting on a steely exterior and when Jo says it's okay she cries with joy. Emma was fine here but she had the least to do. And whilst Beth's story was sad I didn't find myself moved by her death. I'm not sure if it was because we just had the fake out scene right before or the fact we didn't see her body/scene of her not waking up when shaken. I think it would be a 10/10 film if I had cried there. And Timothee, what a handsome, brilliant actor. He was perfect in the role and had the best costumes (and hair). 

Am I right in thinking that when Amy tells Laurie she's not marrying Fred that he resigns himself to marry her and that he was being a shit telling her not marry him prior? I feel like he still wanted Jo. And am I right in thinking that Jo didn't love Laurie, she was just upset that he had been taken from her? Also I think it was bullshit when everyone is telling Jo to go after Frederick and Amy says she's never seen her happier - how about any time she's with Laurie?!

Overall an amazing film, it's a travesty that Gerwig didn't get a best director nomination for this. The music was sublime, as was the cinematography. Also I must say, 6.6% is daylight robbery... 9/10. Here's some dramatic irony I never noticed about Little Women before.

Laurie loves Jo. Jo rejects Laurie because she doesn't love him the same way. Later, when Jo is questioning whether she rejected him too hastily, she tells her mom that it doesn't matter that she doesn't love Laurie romantically; she just wants to be loved by someone. 

However, what she doesn't realize is the newly-formed relationship between Laurie and Amy. Amy romantically loves Laurie, ever since she was a little girl making foot imprints for him and drawing his portrait.  Laurie has always decently liked Amy. Of course, we all know they get married.

In the scene where Laurie reveals to Jo that he married Amy, she asks if he loves her. It couldn't be more obvious that the answer is not an enthusiastic yes. He hasn't fallen head-over-heels for Amy. He likes her, but more importantly, he always wanted to be a March, envious of how close and loving the family is, something he never had. Jo rejected him, Meg was never an option, Beth was dead. Amy was a fine settle. 

Laurie married Amy, not because he loves her passionately, but because he wanted to be loved. He knew she loved him.

Dramatic irony: When it's too late, Jo considers marrying Laurie so she can feel loved. While in turn, Laurie had already married Amy so he can feel loved. This was my first exposure to the story and I loved it. I’ll now see just about anything that Florence Pugh is in after seeing her in Midsommar and this. Beautifully acted. I loved all of the scenes with the four sisters interacting. The scene with Laurie joining their club had me rolling. Almost ugly cried when Beth died. 

Bob Odenkirk threw me off quite a bit because I’m watching Better Call Saul right now and just finished Breaking Bad, but that’s not the movie’s fault.

My only other qualms were in editing, which isn’t something that I usually notice, since I’m no film student or anything like that. It’s also possible that maybe they were logistical errors in the particular showing at my theater, I’m not sure. Examples: stock cat noise when Jo brings the cat in (we know it’s a cat, we don’t need a very standard meow sound to confirm its catness), one scene where the camera was holding on Jo near the end of the movie ended in a frozen still for about a half second, the conversation with Meg and John where he says to get the dress and she says that she sold the fabric already had a slight audio/video lag, the scene where Amy hugs Laurie seemed to have Amy’s lines including post-production as I didn’t notice any facial muscles move during the lines. 

Anyway, I’m being pedantic. The movie is great and everyone should see it. I havent read the book, not watched the previous adaptations, hell I had no idea what the movie was about, but it was getting acclaim and well it didnt dissapoint. Fantastic cast led by one of my favourites in Saoirse Ronan and supported well by others, although I do think Chalamet's part was underwritten but he did well with what he was given, the costume design is fantastic, Desplat's score was beautiful.

Confession, I am a sucker for period pieces and this is up there with one of the best, in my top 10 of the year.

8.5/10. What's going on with this Laura Dern renaissance? She's in everything now. Not complaining though.

Florence Pugh stole the show. She was so mean but funny at the same time **About Jo and Friedrich**

I generally liked the movie, but I’m *so* tired of some people believing that romantic subplots make a heroine “weak.” 

I didn’t like the way Gerwig meshed Louisa May Alcott and Jo’s stories in this adaptation. I’m tired of people overlooking Friedrich Bhaer’s role in Jo’s story and simply viewing him as the shoe-horned romantic interest. 

In the book, he’s the *one* person who took Jo’s writing and talents seriously. He challenged her and influenced her to think ambitiously about a passionate writing career instead of the soulless sensationalist stories she wrote to support herself and her family. 

Some believe that Friedrich was actually based on famous Transcendentalist thinkers who were good friends with the Alcotts in Massachusetts (like Emerson and Thoreau). I can believe that, given his intellectualism, soft-spoken charm, and tender masculinity.  

As others already wrote, it’s not like Alcott *had* to pair Jo off in the end. But, she did. To someone who **valued** her ambition and talent and viewed her as an **intellectual equal.** At a time when Jo became increasingly lonely and isolated because her family was moving on with their lives. *What’s so wrong with that?* 

I’m frustrated that Jo and Friedrich’s dynamic isn’t really ever viewed this way. And, most of the time it’s simply pushed aside as it is in Gerwig’s adaptation. 

Louis Garrel did a great job with what he was given, but it would have been interesting to see more buildup between Jo and Friedrich’s intellectual connection. (I even wrote a whole damn essay on that aspect of the dynamic.)

I hope we will get that adaptation someday, but this isn’t it. I can see why Greta Gerwig wanted to adapt this for the umpteenth time. She did a magnificent job for the most part, it felt fresh and urgent and deeply moving, even funny when it wanted to be. Also, Saoirse Ronan is officially the best actress of her generation. What an amazing performance! ...Yet again.

My one big complaint is the constant flashback and forths. I suspect Gerwig used this technique to distinguish it from previous adaptations, but half the time it added nothing but mild confusion, and even when it did ""work,"" it didn't feel necessary. I also think it undercut the romance between Jo and Laurie.

Speaking of constant flashbacks, I think Togo is one of the few movies in recent memory that used them correctly. We already know that the unruly pup will be Leonhard's top dog, so there's no drama in showing his life chronologically. Better to flash back to his puppy days during their journey to show us just how far he's come. This was my favourite film of the year I think. 

Possibly my favourite film for a good few years. 

Everything was perfect and then that narrative flex at the end was absolutely mind blowing. First time seeing the story of Little Women so I have to ask...do other versions expand on the relationship between Laurie and Amy? In this movie we're told the lesson ""loving and wanting to be loved aren't the same thing"" and then five minutes later it feels like they both just settle for eachother?

I don't know, the connection just didn't feel believable for me and I understand it's based on a true story so it's what happened but I wish we got to see that relationship developed a bit more.

Also another first time watch reaction: I feel like Beth's death was so hollow because the movie barely cared to develop her

I realize this sounds like I hated it but I actually loved it! These things just bothered me, though Went into this blind, not knowing anything about it. Ended up really liking it, which I expected to given the Oscar nominations and the fact that I like historic ""period piece"" movies. The acting was really top notch, but that goes without saying. I wasn't confused by the switching timelines, as the color palette made it clear along with context.

I think what was great about this, is that the characters felt so real. Often in historical pieces, the characters are so different- which was often a sign of the times- but it made them seem quite far away. This movie retained the feel and vibe of the 1800's but it was so relatable- the most relatable historical movie I've seen. And not just because of the message, but because of how the family/friends interacted with each other. 

I also really loved the end, as Jo does get a man, but it's painted as complex. You don't just sit there and roll your eyes because it was just a happy romance. Although it was a happy ending, Jo worked and faced a lot of struggles that women today face- wanting to be successful and having goals/ambitions but still wanting to be loved, and have a more ""traditional"" love story in that sense. Saw it again today with my mom after going on Thursday night and I think this might be my new favorite film. I don’t know why it connects with me (29 y/o man not that it matters but for context) but I love everything about this film and I could watch it everyday



I think the non linear story telling strangely adds to the rewatch ability because you remember scenes and how they relate to each other but they can go right after each other (Amy saying she’s always loved him cut to her making a mold of her foot) or separated by a long time like Jo waking up when Beth is sick



It’s really an incredible film and I’m going to be thoroughly pissed if Greta doesn’t get a director nom Went in blind and damn this is one of the best movies I've seen. It's probably the most delightful movie to watch with your family that feels timeless about growing up, the economics of life decisions, and following your heart whether it's love or a profession. Gotta admit when Jo went to chase after the french dude in the rain, it almost lost me with how romcom it felt, but damnit it was the most satisfying thing to see Jo find someone. Not sure how I feel about this one, especially after rewatching the 1994 version which has lots of strong elements.

Cutting up the story in two and jumping back and forth just didn’t work for me and undermined several key story points (like knowing Jo rejects Teddy in the first 10 minutes).  Older versions (and the book) allow the characters to grow and develop so you feel something when they start making big decisions, I thought the time jumps added nothing if not confusion (sometimes didn’t know when I was until a minute into a scene.)

The casting in this film was really bizarre, obviously more about star power than the right actors.  Emma Watson was actually kind of bad (and unbelievable as the eldest) while Florence Pugh looks and sounds as old as the rest.  Maybe casting a child who grows into Florence like previous versions would’ve worked better.  Timothee has the opposite problem, playing the younger self well but hardly believable as a grown up man now bitter about the past.  Having said that, I’ll watch Chris Cooper/Meryl Streep in anything.

Liked the “twist” ending but think it would’ve worked even better if it had followed the format of the novel and allowed Jo room to fall for the German tutor/be changed by his introduction of urban intellectualism into her life.  THEN surprise us by rejecting him.  In this version he’s almost a nobody.

I think this is an American Hustle type situation where a lot of the buzz is because this is a back to back film from a rising voice, but might not be that remembered in years to come. I went and saw LW by myself on a quiet Saturday, and felt like the viewing experience was bestowed upon me in that theatre like a gift. I started crying sometime in the beginning just because of the aesthetic beauty, and glee at seeing all these amazing actors together on the screen. Then became some sort of vessel of moving emotions through until the end. Either laughed or cried the whole time. 

I don't have anything specific to build on from the plot at the moment except that as a 20-something working woman, out on her own and away from her family really trying to make something for myself, I felt united with a grander female experience and am really appreciative of that. Like I said, this film is a gift. 

I'm a very visual person, so the set design and wardrobe was enough to make me lose it. EXTREMELY rich and beautiful. Timothée Chalamet's pure and simple existence included. ;) this is super random (and late) but I went to see *Little Women* for the second time this week and since then I've had [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azw4NZ_PEUk) on repeat. listening to it, and thinking back about the scene with Ronan/Chalamet dancing outside, has made me really happy. just a nice pick-me-up.

easily my favorite scene of the movie and put a huge smile on my face both times. I think the movie drags a bit and the first act was a bit sloppy in terms of pacing. That being said, the character were so fleshed out and well written, the main cast, especially Pugh, Ronan and Scanlen killed it - as they should, they were the backbone of this movie, after all. Also, I may have developed a crush on Jo... she is full on my kind of girl lol I absolutely loved Jo's speech to Marmie in the attic about her desire for companionship but not necessarily marriage or some great true love. The cure for her loneliness isn't a husband, which is frustrating for a woman in that time since it's so expected. 

Personally, after that speech, I would've liked a little more of an ambiguous ending to if Jo ended up with Bhaer or not. That scene of all of them celebrating Marmie's birthday seems to confirm that yes, she did catch him at the train station, but a cooler ending would've been if you don't see Bhaer at all, but instead end it with Jo turning to the camera and smiling at somebody, leaving it up to the audience if she sees Bhaer or someone else. I think I’m the only person here who didn’t like the non linear approach of the movie. In my opinion... this movie was really not good.

And it could've been great! They had all the right ingredients (actors, money etc.) But Greta Gerwig dropped the ball on this. Barely any time was given to flesh out the main characters. Meg was quite bland, TIMOTHEE AS LAURIE WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED AND GIVEN NOTHING TO WORK WITH. Marmee was made a one-dimensional character. MR. MARCH, WHO IS A CENTRAL PART OF THE STORY WAS GIVEN ONE SCENE and it was completely unbelievable when everyone acted all excited to see him after he came back FROM WAR because the girls barely talking about him in scenes prior.  
There was no sense of or atmosphere of their town as well. Concord (I believe?) is a charming place and a character of its own and there were barely any shots showing A TOWN

And don't even get me started on the terrible inaccuracy of the outfits and hair. If you're going to set a story in the Civil War era, you need to dress the characters historically. Otherwise, it takes you completely out of the story. I swear, all four sisters were wearing dresses from different time periods or modern interpretations of dresses from the 1860s.  
Also, I understand they were all progressive for their time but the scene in Laurie's grandfather's house where the sisters all squabble and yell over each and Marmee just goes ""My girls have a mind of their own"". Well...  
1. Even in modern times, teenage girls would not yell at each other in a stranger's home they just met. I know it was meant to show how close they were and ""sisterly"" but it was over the top and unrealistic, especially when you consider the time period.  
2. It did nothing to show us who the characters were. And was annoying.  
3. Real Marmee would've told those girls to be polite and shut up.

Good parts:  
There were a few good monologues from Jo. I like the one in the attic with Marmee.  
Amy was great. But her romance to Laurie was not believable because THEY DIDN'T GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO SHOW THE CHARACTER OF LAURIE

I just don't think the switching up of the chronology worked in this movie's favor. There was really no reason to do it except that it made this version of Little Women ""different"". But because of it, emotional investment in the characters and character development was completely lost. It was too ambitious for a two hour movie. Maybe it could've worked if it was a short series (like the much better 2017 version of Little Women. Seriously check it out, it's amazing!). Somehow I was rooting for Amy the whole time. Florence Pugh stole the show. Meryl Streep's no Maggie Smith. I watched this with my wife today. She loved the 90's movie, I never seen it nor read anything about the story so I went in blind.

The acting was great, the depiction of the era was pretty good too. However the time jumps - I was completely lost until about the end. I couldn't keep track of what was when and what was going on. I couldn't get a handle on how long Beth (was it Beth?) was sick with Scarlett Fever. Was it years? I don't understand how that works because nothing was linear.

I get people who are familiar with the movie liked the new way it was cut up, but for someone who isn't aware of it - it really hurt the narrative. Just got back from seeing this.  It was beautiful and well acted and overall very, very good... but as someone COMPLETELY new to the story of Little Women I feel that my appreciation of the movie was hampered by constantly questioning when events had occurred.

Some of my favorite films have multiple intertwining timelines, and I appreciate that Greta Gerwig didn't do too much hand-holding when it came to the timeline jumps, but I've never been so unsure of a movie's timeline.

Not helping things was the weird absences of both parents, but mainly the father.  Odenkirk was there in some scenes when the girls were young, and some scenes where the girls were older, but mainly not present.  He was introduced so late in the film that I had figured that he was off at war during all of the 'young' scenes... or possibly that he had been killed in the war and would not be present in the 'adult' scenes.  You find out this isn't the case around the time that Beth is dying - but because of this weird misdirection, I was convinced that Beth recovered from scarlet fever just in time for Christmas and the big reunion of the family only to die *the next morning*.  I sat there thinking, 'that was some incredibly clunky editing' only to have my wife explain to me later that Beth's recovery was years prior to her getting sick again and dying.

To make matters worse, you have four actresses that are already too old to play their characters at their *oldest* ages.  To have 25 - 29 year-olds playing characters at age 12 without any real effort to make them look older or younger in the different scenes is... confusing at best.  Hints like Jo's different hair length is helpful, but only if it's consistent throughout, and this is only introduced 2/3rds of the way through the film.  And aren't the events happening over a period of time, separated by \~7 years?  I can't say for sure but I feel even the hair length was a 'red herring' in determining the timeline - normally this would be inconsequential, but not in this case when one is expected to be looking for 'clues' at the beginning of a scene to determine when it's happening.

All in all, the look of the film is sooooo beautiful, it was so well acted and scored, and the story was interesting so I still thoroughly enjoyed it - but I don't know if I would recommend it to someone who has zero knowledge of the story. Seeing the flourishing school at the end with all the characters doing something within their skill set was so rewarding. I will definitely be back to see it again and probably buy it. I love Greta & what an amazing cast! Great movie, really enjoyed it. Between Pugh, Ronan, Dern and Streep it was an extraordinary collection of actors that just own the screen whenever they are on. Love watching all of them.

I thought the nonlinearity was spectacular - so seamless, elegantly executed, with so much trust in the audience to pick up on it without really blatant cues. That's something that can I think only really be pulled off on screen; it would be too hard to be that subtle on a page.

My only complaint, as someone not really familiar with the source material, is that there are a *lot* of plot strands to burn through. It made the film feel a little long to me in the back half. So, I think this movie is good, not great for me. The good parts are obvious:

1. The acting (Saiorse and Timothee in particular).
2. The character development. The characters feel really alive, fleshed out and likable.
3. I liked the non-linear story-telling. It really hit me.

My major problem is how the character arcs end. I feel like it pretty much fumbles all of them. Just seems like there are importance missing scenes.  They all lack moments that demonstrate their growth and justify their endings. Like Meg’s arc is pretty much just three scenes and has no middle. Amy has a huge scene where she demonstrates her independence and refuses to be a backup plan for Laurie... and then the next scene reverses course with no explanation. And then we don’t really get much of an ending for Jo despite being the main character. She writes the book, we get the fake ending, they tell us it’s the fake ending and then we don’t really get a real ending that explains why she’s happy now. The themes just don’t really get tied up.

8/10 32 M cynical fucker here but goddamn this film moved me. Greta Gerwig has a real flair for writing organic characters with human dialogue. A genuinely heartwarming film sorely needed in a cold cynical age 9.5/10 I liked this adaptation to the movie. Although, the younger scenes should've had different actors than the older scenes, but this is a nitpicking problem. Usually, Amy is villianized because her ambition and realistic nature makes her seem cruel when she's older. Laurie and Amy always seemed rushed but Jo and Laurie would be gross. Overall I think the casting for Laurie, Amy, Meg and Aunt March saved it. I have never seen a Little Women before, but this movie was so amazing! I loved Florence's character and how she was whiney/ dramatic. Jo was totally bad ass! Love Love Loved it! The dancing scenes, the costumes, the time jumps. So poignant and necessary! This movie was amazing. Saw it last night. The whole time I was captivated by the acting, the costumes, the colours. 

Florence Pugh did such a great job.

My only critique is that I didn’t feel a connection with Beth at all. I was sad, because the other women were absolutely gutted, but I felt like Beth wasn’t explored as much as she could’ve been. 

Loved Meryl as Aunt March. Okay first of all they made Baer hot?

Second of all these adaptations are all so similar. Burning Meg's hair. Meeting Laurie at the party. Giving away their Christmas breakfast. Hiding Laurie in the attic. Meg's ball. Amy getting into trouble at school. Jo not taking Amy to the play and Amy burning Jo's book. Amy falling in the frozen pond. It all plays out exactly the same. Gerwig could have never read the book and only watched the movies. It's eerily similar. I guess it could be because they are all very faithful to the book?

Meryl Streep killed it as Aunt March. She disappeared into the role like she became an American Maggie Smith. Thimoty Chalamet could play anything so he was fine as lonesome Laurie and lovelorn Laurie and debauchery Laurie. Amy's always been my favorite, but Florence Pugh wasn't Amy to me. The economic proposition line was weird like a revisionist woke view.

And then Jo...  Saoirse Ronan made her too pretty and feminine. Jo is supposed to have the mannerisms of a boy. I'm not sure how an actor can convey that, but she should have an androgynous vibe. I'm fine with Jo regretting her choice to turn down Laurie because it adds drama, but if you're going to commit to regret, I say just go all in and make her say she loves him. But Jo saying she wants to open a school so girls have somewhere to learn, that's just too much. Jo specifically opened a school for boys. Because she wanted to raise other boys like Laurie, because he was like her brother, that's what she wanted. It's also why she's happy that he marries Amy. Because he's her brother and having him in the family is the best outcome. [removed] My wife forced me to watch this movie with her ...

Me 10 minutes in: “I can’t believe I’m watch this bullshit!”

Me 90 minutes in: “Why did you do that to my sweet Teddy Bear!?” Few directors have a stronger pair of films to start their directing career than Gerwig. 

I can’t wait to watch her films over the next decades. I cried when Amy told Laurie to stop being mean when he told her not to marry Fred Vaughn. 

I cried when Jo and Beth are on the beach together and she says she’ll stop the tide. 

I cried when Jo lies in bed with Beth and pleads for her to fight and not go quietly.

I cried when Jo wakes up and Beth isn’t there. 

I cried when Jo said she doesn’t believe in marriage she’s so lonely. 

I cried when Laurie kept telling Jo he loved her and she’ll get married and he’ll just watch. 

This film hit me like an absolute TRAIN. I honestly haven’t cried this much at a film in years, good grief. Absolutely loved it and can’t wait to watch it  again and cry some more! There were several moments where I was bracing for the movie to use a cliche, but it ended up avoiding it, and then I remembered this book was written before those things became cliches.

For one, I kept waiting for the Dad to die or be confirmed dead in the later timeline. Everything about this just screamed a ""Dead Dad"" story to me.

And at the beginning I just assumed it as a given that Laurie's grandfather would be some kind of antagonist, like an Ebeneezer Scrooge type character. I love all the little updates. Amy's money speech, Jo's ""I'm so lonely"" outburst, and so on, they all fully realize the commentary that was trying to be made when the book was first written but was probably left out or subdued due to publishing fears. They, along with the nonlinear storytelling (an absolutely phenomenal move), really make the characters that aren't Jo feel alive, and you can see their growth as people more succinctly because of that back and forth decision. The cast in this movie was out of control. Everytime a new character would come on screen - they were a recognizable actor.



Anyways, I've never read the book or seen any of the previous movies, and I really enjoyed the story. You know the feeling when you see a movie where you have very high expectations and the movie still blows past them? That is how I feel about this. Instant classic and all-time favorite. dunno if this has been done before but  
[me when they revealed the dad](https://imgur.com/ZHtGtU2) So I finally watched the movie and I'd like to share my opinion, even if it might be unpopular. I really, really did not like it. So many things are wrong with it. 

Let's start with Amy. Oh my god, do I even need to say it. When a girl who is supposed to be 12 in the early parts of the book looks older than all of her sisters and sounds like an adult woman with a low, slightly hoarse voice, that just doesn't work. She doesn't seem to show any emotions other then sulking and disapproving, her apology to Jo after she burns the book is so far from sencere that I wouldn't forgive her even after the near drowning. She looks out of place at school and she's just not a good fit to play young Amy. Maybe if she was at least voiced by a different actress in her young years that would not sound so off-putting, but as it is I winced every time she spoke in the ""past"" bits of the film. 

Jo. Why is she nearly blond?? Jo is supposed to be brown haired. Otherwise not terrible.

Why does Meg look younger than all of her sisters other than Beth? She's supposed to be the oldest... She definitely doesn't give a sense of a girl who is trying to act like an older sister. Generally her character wasn't developed at all, I wouldn't see anything more than a pretty girl in the film character if I haven't read the book and didn't know what she's supposed to be. Very flat, shallow portrayal of a character. 

Mrs March, I didn't like her at all either. She didn't give the impression of a warm, calm, cosy and strong mother of a family. She just looks like a hectic, slightly hysterical woman. And ginger for some reason... 

I was disappointed with the portrayal of the scene of Beth's illness. For me, in the book this is one of the most powerful moments, when they wait, at night, when the doctor said that if she makes it through the night, she'll live... Laurie's sudden announcement that their mother is coming, that he sent for her. The tension of the wait, Laurie disappearing to fetch their mother, the dawn, the arrival of their mother, Beth finally sleeping peacefully. It always gave me goosebumps. Here they just brushed over it... Blended it into the story of Beth's death. 

I didn't like the patchiness of jumping back and forward in time. I didn't like the casting for the most part. The ending takes away some of the atmosphere by being too obvious and too dramatic. Overall, this is definitely not my thing... 

From the good/ok parts - Laurie was ok, Meryl Streep is amazing as always but there isn't a lot of her so it doesn't save the film. The atmosphere of the time was recreated well, beautiful costumes, nice music. I haven't watched the older adaptation. But I loved this movie. One of the opening shots were she's running back home with the 20 dollars was really nice. My favourite was the scene at the beach just before the sister dies. I love what she did with the story too, the back and forth pacing was really good. I'm just now noticing this, but there are several shots of the door closing on Bhaer in the film. It seems to be symbolism. Gerwig has basically closed the door on he and Jo's storyline together in this adaptation.

Also, while Gerwig's creation of the Jo pursues Laurie subplot does connect more to modern times, I wish that she had focused more on Jo and Bhaer. Even though Alcott created the professor to sell books and it is by no means a natural match, it's in no way instalovey. It's actually well-executed.

Don't get me wrong. I love the film's ending. I think between Beth's death and her marriage to Bhaer, Jo's character underwent significant changes in the series (not entirely for the better). It just might have made more of a statement to show that even after everything that they had been through, Jo still chose to remain single. As someone who’s never seen the other adaptations or read the book I absolutely loved this

I didn’t expect to cry and I ended up crying probably 5 times. The cast were fantastic and I wholeheartedly adore Emma Watson

I found the flashbacks a bit disorientating at first and I definitely missed a part of the story because I didn’t realise it wasn’t in chronological order did not like the flashback structure for the story. we see all the main plot points in the first 10 minutes while we are supposed to see the character building and story evolving. also, a french actor for Friedrich Bhaer? ok. lived for Florence Pugh, though. I loved that unlike most adaptations As good as they are  it was about Little WOMEN plural not just Jo and her other sisters. Every sister had an arc and something to do. It wasn’t just the Jo show even though she is the main character. They were all well cast and the chemistry felt so genuine the interactions felt like actual sisters. 

I’ve always loved Amy even as a kid I thought her burning Jo’s book while cruel was so badass as well. I understand why she is unpopular with fans of the story my but her faults are also what make her so compelling she is a constant contradiction vain and self centred but also observant and warm and kind when she wants to be especially as a woman. Florence Pugh is a revelation in the role and I’m so glad her take on Amy is being appreciated by fans. I also find it fascinating  that the scene that is getting the most circulation is not a Jo scene but the scene with Amy and Laurie where she has her speech about what it means to a woman in the century. 

I think the studio will/should be pushing Florence Pugh for Best Actress in A Supporting Role. And Greta Gerwig for Best Director and/or Best Adapted Screenplay. The structure going back and forth in time works well and I never felt confused.

It also felt like the Laurie relationship was the most developed it has ever been. You can see from the get go why Jo and Laurie wouldn’t work. She never treats him as anything less than a brother. Everytime he tries to get closer to her she visibly gets uncomfortable. Amy and Laurie are a positioned as an adult relationship. He speaks to her maturely and I did get a sense of attraction/sexual tension in their scenes together. I also really like that Meg has more to do. Never read the book but as someone who watches a lot of old movies, I have seen every movie version of it so I guess I knew the basic story pretty well going in.

It was pretty good and it really 'refreshes' the material by jumping back and forth in time.

SPOILERS

It was a smart thing to hold off on Laurie confessing his love to jo near the end, as this is the emotional heart of the story - and plays a crucial part in inspiring her to write the book (at this point in her life she has just lost her sister and lost him  - and the book is getting some of her own agency back).

I will say though, although I think Chalmant was good casting for Laurie, I wish he had 'deepened' his voice to sound more like an adult in his Paris/post-Paris scenes - it would have made his change of heart about which sister to choose make more sense.

My biggest questions about the film was adding the 'meta' element of having Jo's 'happy ending' with Bhaer be a fantasy as a means to get a better deal on selling the book.

On the surface I like the idea - but it sent me back to the wiki page on the real life of Louisa May Alcott and from that saw that Little Women  is not strictly 'autobiographical' and much (the romance with Laurie for example) is fantasy. Also, in contrast to the movie, in real life Alcott's publisher kept bugging her to write a kids book. 

In other words, much of what the film  presents as 'reality' is just another layer of fantasy projected upon the book. Its weird.

END OF SPOILER

For all the admirable things about it and interesting choices, I don't think the film entirely 'works'. Probably the Winona Ryder version is most successful as a whole, though I can't say I entirely love it either because the material is just not 100% up my alley. Not to sound like a total asshole but it blows me away that people have a hard time with the chronology of this movie.  There are super stark differences in the color palette (or tone, or whatever you want to call it) to indicate if a scene is in the past or present.  Like, a talented director intentionally relied solely on the color difference, so of course she's going to make it \*drastic\*, which she did.  It's one of these things where I think the blame on any confusion is solely on the viewer.  With some movies' plot, they don't hold your hand, and I think the same expectation should apply here.  If you didn't get it, that's on you.  It was DRASTIC. The movie conveys something like an Ishiguro\* tragedy with the life of Jo. All the sisters lost something, but they gained something from their losses also. The time jumps were most effective when it juxtaposes their ideals of their past and their hardships in the present. This is especially true for Jo. Though Jo strived for self-realization (hence, independence), what was most important to her is her family. Jo cared and did so much to try to keep her family together. We can see it all throughout the film: The guilt that she felt for hating Amy. Selling her hair to pay for Mammy's ticket to see her ill father. How much she did for Beth during both her illnesses. How she pleaded Meg to remain. Rejection of Laurie's proposal (though that has more layers to it). Even in New York, she was writing and working so that she can help support the family. Still, life kept taking things away from her. Jo really wanted everything to stay the same most of all, but one by one, each of her sisters moved on. Meg marrying. Amy leaving. Laurie's proposal and her rejection ended practically their friendship. And eventually, losing Beth. No matter how hard much money she saved and how much stories she wrote for Beth, her death was inevitable. What was full in the beginning became more and more empty. 

She had no other options but to move forward, being thrust by fate. She chose the only path given to her but holding tightly her comforting past. Then when Beth passed, Jo, in her most grievous and vulnerable moment, admitted all that she was striving for, her ambition and the freedom to pursue her dreams, she voiced out her unfulfillment, how unfair it is to be a woman, and how much that aches. Beyond that, though, she felt more and more alone due to the loss of all her relationships. She wished to reverse her decision and wanted to choose love instead, but she already made her choice and paid the price. The unread letter, her last attempt to retreat to her past, torn and washed away. It was too late. Laurie moved on, something that she thought she wanted. There's nothing left but to write and to seal her heart and soul into the last tribute to Beth and to finish her ambition. Little Women became both a nostalgic memorial of all her treasured and fond memories of her sisterhood and a bridge toward her ambitious future. In the end, Jo embraced her newly bound book as her lover, as her child, or perhaps, as her family. 

\*Kazuro Ishiguro is the author of Never Let Me Go and The Remains of the Day among his other works. He often writes about regrets of the past and the effects of past decisions. I really loved every character but Florence Pugh really shined as Amy. Every-time she was on screen, she just resembled a finely crafted renaissance painting. That in combo with the gorgeous scenery and outfits, this film was just so beautiful to behold even if I have a few issues with the story etc. Having never seen or read Little Women before, I found the timelines very confusing... and I wasn’t confused by Witcher!  Wish I had noticed the color palates sooner.  All the girls just seemed the same age the whole time (except Florence Pugh.. was she supposed to be like 12???), and I didn’t realize that Emma Watson was the oldest, lol, Why did they cast a bunch of 12 year old extras for that classroom scene? Cast 16 years olds and make them look younger. At least then it wouldn't look like that scene from Elf. That part got the biggest laugh out of my audience, great line. And what a trilogy it was lol Nominated for Best Actress in all 3 as well. But also I hope not But I want more! I absolutley loved this too. Made the time gaps very easy to follow, although some people won't pick up on it I'm sure. I also loved how much the film mirrored this. The early scenes are BURSTING with energy, feel very free form alive, and the later scene have very tight and sharp dialogue. The filters really added a lot to this I think. Also love how it slowly gets more blue as the timelines get closer, then the end of the movie it's warm again. Yep, the color filters helped a ton! I also followed Jo’s hair for the first few jumps, haha. 

But it felt so natural, all the time jumps. Greta Gerwig could repeatedly pull the rug from beneath us, jumping from happy scene to sad scene in a snap. I was in tears a few times throughout, with these sucker punches of time jumps. Also the haircut! Him yelling that he loves her repeatedly was brutal. Chalamet is so fucking talented


I kinda held off on admiring his acting skills the first couple big movies but fuck, that guy can act I think it is because it's also in the 1994 adaptation of the novel. I love Bob, but this bit of casting is a puzzler. And then he had that one line ""I'm going!"" that he said in such a modern way. Honestly I was smiling from ear to ear. He exudes such warmth, especially in this even with the few scenes he has. It was a lovely surprise So jarring. On the other hand, it instantly conveyed so much about the family. Oh, of course their dad is Bob Odenkirk. lol. Her arc with Mr. Laurence was very moving. I read her as non-neurotypical in this movie, which I found more interesting than just ""too saintly for this world.' i love how she was feeding her dolls at the table, and the line about talking to the horses was a nice touch [deleted] During the scenes when she got sick again, I had a hard time noticing that she was sick. She seemed so robust and healthy in the beach scene. Then when Amy tells Laurie that beth was the best of them, I had a hard time understanding why. In the book I can see why she might say that, but in this adaptation Beth is spunky and a tiny bit of a rebel, not really the stay at home angel that she is in the novel and other adaptations. I feel like this Beth was actually based on Alcott's sister, Lizzie, rather than the book character. [deleted] It’s really a credit to Greta and the cast for not making it over the top soap box preacher and make everything natural and compelling


This could’ve easily been a yes all women trainwreck but instead they portrayed these characters as full fledged people aware of themselves, the world and what they value


Everyone involved nailed this I fear she looked far too old to be amy and my sister and I agreed while she was very talented she looked the oldest of all of the actresses Yeah, Laura Dern was the only one I didn't enjoy in their role -- she just seemed too sticky sweet, the hairstyle looked very modern (they all did to some extent but hers really stood out) and there wasn't that sense of an iron core that Sarandon had, and which the real Marmee must have had in spades considering the shit she had to deal with. And the ""ashamed of my country"" scene was really jarring and just not very 1865-ish. his entrance into that scene was PERFECT Especially Emma Watson doing a bad British accent. I loved that scene so much. Had me laughing the most since maybe Booksmart, which is a totally different movie I’m glad I wasn’t the only one thrown by that. Only thing that broke my immersion ahah Ffuck, I thought it was Kevin Costner. Someone in my theater burst out laughing and it took me entirely out of what was meant to be a heartwarming moment. Lol I was doubly surprised because I was expecting Dylan Baker.  I had forgotten I was only picturing him because he played the role in the recent miniseries. Fuck yes i felt this too.

Edit to add: the camera work brought you fully into the scene. Combined with the ""lonely"" speech i felt that the message was extremely powerful. The March sisters know whats expected of them and choose their own ways You may love that scene even more when you learn that:

Amy's speech about marriage was not in the initial script, but was suggested by actress Meryl Streep. After working and talking with director Greta Gerwig, Streep asserted that there needed to be a moment in the film that gave modern audiences the opportunity to understand the true powerlessness of women in that period; not only could they not vote or work, but through marriage they would lose ownership of their money, property, and children. The speech was written shortly before shooting the scene, and became one of the most powerful moments of the film.

AND 

According to Florence Pugh, Amy's big speech to Laurie about marriage was given to Pugh by director Greta Gerwig a few minutes before they were due to shoot the scene, it was handwritten on a piece of scrap paper. Hands down my favorite scene in the movie. The writing was great, but Florence Pugh elevated it. She's such an incredible actress. Loved that scene. Also loved towards the end when she got her moment to shine and said “I was always wise. It’s just that you were too busy looking for my faults.” This is the first version of either adaptation to film or book where I didn't find Amy wholly obnoxious.  Pugh elevated the character for me and I wasn't expecting that at all. Also loved this scene and the whole topic of what it means to be a woman and have little options for independence in those days. It wasn’t really discussed in previous movies it was a good way to make this movie more modern and Amy’s scene was perfect. Her and Laurie seemed off to me until the words ""My Lord""

Biggest laugh of the movie and it fits both of them That scene and the following one with Jo's monologue about what's expected of a woman were incredible. This may sound dumb but it made my want to go apple picking in Vermont or something. The scenery was gorgeous. I know it's not the point, but saoirse's outfit during that scene was fire And Greta kept most of the dialogues from the novel. It's perfect. Something about both of them on screen together. From lady bird to little women, they just have insane chemistry Yeah I need it. I noticed that the part from the trailer was cut so I wanna watch that in the scene as a whole. It was so beautiful and emotional. They are tremendous I was sobbing! Loved the symbolism of her sinking under the weight of marriage (the white church above her on the horizon) after she refused him. Amazing filmmaking. Absolutely! It’s not as obvious as with book Laurie or Christian Bale’s Laurie, but he was a bit of a March opportunist. He always knew he would marry into the March family — if he had his druthers, it would have been Jo. He didn’t have much family, so he was drawn to how close the Marches were and craved being a part of that. Bale’s version is much more opportunistic than Chalamet’s.

The very fact that Jo has to ask Laurie if he really loves her is telling. Chalamet makes some good acting choices in that scene: he’s trying to sell the Amy relationship to Jo to avoid creating conflict among the sisters, he wants to make it seem like he’s moved on to look good to Jo, and he wants to protect Amy. Laurie wants to make it seem like he really fell for Amy so Jo won’t think she was “second,” after Amy tells Laurie she fears always being second to Jo. I find these motivations to be richer and more complex than Bale’s. This was exactly what I was talking about with my mom after - I bought Amy loved Laurie, I bought Jo did not love Laurie, I bought Laurie loved Jo... I couldn’t truly buy that Laurie was in love with Amy. I’m interested to watch that performance a bit more closely on a second viewing! I think that's intentionally how Chalamet played him, or at least that he was still more in love with Jo. He seemed so mad when that other guy showed up lol. Laurie getting with Amy always seemed a little dubious in the past adaptations, but this time was the most believable. It still feels a little out of nowhere and you can't help but feel a little sorry for Amy for looking like the second choice. Yes, I was convinced that he would have married any of the March sisters. I think he was in love with the family overall and wanted to be part of it by any means necessary. Saoirse never fails to make me relate to her character. She exudes charisma. I love seeing her in every project she does. Easily should get nominated for BA. Literally on fire i'm so excited that we might be in for decades of saoirse-greta collabs At this point I’ll watch anything she stars in. Regardless of whether the movie itself is good or not so much, she consistently gives great performances. between this and knives out it’s been a good season for the big-cast movie! >Holy crap a movie with over five A-List actors that is a solid film. 

That's how this whole year has been. From Endgame, to Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood, to Knives Out, ^^^^^CATS and now Little Women. 2019 was a good year for ensamble casts. He's hovering outside the March house, not his own Lady Bird's mother was absolutely amazing, loved her character. American accents at that time would have likely sounded closer to British. 

Emma Stone was originally meant to have Watson's part but dropped out at the last minute. I literally loved that line so much, so fucking good. Perfectly captures an intense platonic female friendship in adolescence and sort of drifting apart, you can really feel Jo's sense of betrayal. Don't worry, we know you were crying for literally the entire second half of the movie. We were too. What kind of monster wouldn't? I think you hit the nail on the head when you said that it was a meta ending.  My understanding is that the book was originally released in two parts. Alcott intended for Jo not to marry anyone, but received so much pressure by the publisher to have her marry that she finally relented. But, she intentionally had Jo reject Laurie and instead wedded her to a random person she introduced, as sort of a joke and FU to the editor.

Gerwig wanted to incorporate this story into the movie somehow, so she set up Jo to be sort of a stand-in for Alcott (who herself never married).  The monetary terms that Jo negotiates in the movie were apparently identical to the actual terms that Alcott negotiated for ""Little Women"" herself.  I think the movie ending in this implies that Jo should not have married anyone, but ends up marrying Friedrich so that there is a feel-good, happy ""storybook"" ending.  I really liked it : ) I thought it was strange too, I think it honestly just served to try to give some sort of explanation for ""abandoning"" Jo's whole thing, since we didn't have much time with him for it to make sense. If nothing else, the contrasting Christmases of Beth’s recovery and her death made the experiment worth it. >Non-linear structure was a fresh way to engage with this story.  Such a great choice.

I got a bit lost sometimes, but I prefer that to it being a straight linear shot. Although it seems like some stuff is noticeably on the cutting room floor, like more development for Laurie. He was too much of a jerk sometimes. This is my first exposure to any form of ""Little Women"" and while I mostly agree, it was a little odd to know Jo turned Laurie down basically from the beginning of the movie. Great Gerwig was on TCM and described it as looking back on your moments in childhood, not realizing that there is a point when your family and friends are together I a certain way for the last time. You grow up and life changes so that, even when you are together physically, it's not quite the same. That absolutely killed me, but I love it so much. Yeah, she’s honestly my front runner now for best director. This was one of the best adaptations I’ve ever seen I can’t wait to see her *Barbie* movie starring Margot Robbie that she’s writing with Noah Baumbach, as weird as that sounds to type. This and *Lady Bird* were great so anything she makes in the future will be on my radar. Neither were Frances Ha or Mistress America. I’m much older than your brother and ashamed to admit I also didn’t get this until I chatted with my forgiving girlfriend outside the theater afterwards. What can I say, I’m a dumbass. I’ve never read the book or seen other adaptations. When the nonlinearity was explained to me I did remember the one time at the beginning of the movie there was a “7 years earlier” subtitle, but after that it just never really occurred to me it was jumping around. I did not notice that Beth reappeared after dying. It might have helped if there was some more apparent difference in age in the very young characters...

For a while I was also confused by the two different names for Teddy/Laurie and was trying to figure out if there were two different actors who looked very similar. I didn’t know the actor and I’m not great with new faces.

Meg’s husband seemed to come out of nowhere to me — I guess he was in a couple of scenes before their wedding but I felt like there was no development of his character or their relationship whatsoever. I suppose it’s understandable though, movie was already pretty long.

Finally, I thought the ordering by age of the sisters was supposed to be Jo > Meg > Amy >>>>> Beth. Jo just looked older to me (maybe Emma Watson will always look 18ish to me because of Hermione) and Beth looked really really young (way younger than Pugh as Amy, she looked fairly mature to me since I last saw her in Midsommar) but I guess Beth was just supposed to look sick.

Anyway despite my embarrassing lack of comprehension I still enjoyed the ride so props to Gerwig and the cast. 

Brb kms i was thankful for amy’s bangs and jo’s short hair, they were nice cues I walked out of there liking Amy almost as much as Jo and I'm amazed. Pugh did a fantastic job. Agree even though I still found her a bit of an annoying bitch(for the youth part)  I still thought she was funny and loveable which is something I never thought I would say >Took her from my most hated character to a sympathetic one

Close. I still think you can't come all the way back from burning someone's writing or art I’m glad they got Amy’s button nose down pat!!! and had me rooting for amy and laurie instead of being sad that he doesn’t end up with jo Seems to be just me but I really disliked her even in the end. The burning of her sister's prized writing just killed me. I thought the actress was really stiff, just had the wrong facial expressions, all the way to the end, which made me dislike her. I just couldn't resonate with her problems. Wait she wasn't? Oh wow I thought she was In the book it feels similar since she’s emotionally immature and Amy is not i really liked the scene where she was doing a bad british accent, when laurie was initiated into their troupe, that was well done. it was just off enough. I remember thinking when I saw her casting, ""great, a non-American who won't be able to keep up with her American co-stars' accents."" Then I looked up the others...Ronan's Irish, Pugh's English and Scanlen's Australian lmao It's improved in that she is just trying less lol. 

She sounded British the entire film Loved her American accent in Bling Ring (even though it’s the one like most British people do all the time).

Feel like that’s when she’s at her best, or at least it’s the only time I can separate her from Hermoine. It improved but she still has a long way to go... I caught Emma Watson slipping back into an English accent more than a few times. Especially the emotional scenes with her husband. Still loved the movie, I was just surprised the director didn’t catch that and it made it to the big screen I don't think it was well done. She was slipping in and out constantly. I found that scene really jarring too! They probably should have at least cast older girls for that scene to make the difference less obvious. But I also had a big problem buying Chalamet as older Laurie because he looked like a teenager to me the entire time. It made the drunken womanizing scene really weird. Having never read the book I just assumed it was one of those old single room schools where kids of all ages studied. There's mention elsewhere in the film that there isn't a proper local school for girls. She's in a school room with girls of all ages I actually prefer they didn't do the double casting. I had a much harder time with that than with this. the only way I could see it working is it there were siblings that looked like each other or a different actress who looked younger. But I was really surprised that they got kids that young lmao it was so obvious it was kind of funny I want to say to me it isn’t as jarring as it could have been. Coming from New England, school houses back in the day used to have kids of all ages in them. Maybe a few more older kids would have helped fill out the scene more but honestly it was pretty accurate to me of what it was like in more rural areas in New England. So it's like a girl-girl thing? Because that is the one thing missing from The Shining. Beth’s really sick... I love this episode and watch it every so often on Netflix What else has Pugh been in? I’m excited to discover more of her ! \>Jo realizes that she can be who she wants and be with who she wants to be with without detriment to her story.

Aw that's a nice interpretation to the ending! I found it rather trite... but I like your  take away. I was so confused by that too! I expected last words or jo holding her hand through it, not Jo sleeping through her sister’s last breath. That was the only part of the film I found off putting. Particularly in comparison with the Clair Danes version of Beth I figured her body was moved downstairs to the parlor for prep and service. My favorite Adult Amy scene has to be Amy's freak out when she first saw Laurie in Paris. Absolutely agree. I loved the movie overall, but gosh Florence Pugh was *so* good in it. I want to see it again just for her, basically. The scene where she talks to Laurie about what being a woman means, holy crap. when it cuts from the timothee + florence scene to the scene where she's plastering her foot.. the RANGE MS. PUGH!!! she was absolutely phenomenal Her accomplice, Ms. Ronan, should be considered ""excellent"" The scene with her at the party in the pink dress broke my heart. It’s the hardest role, imo. Jo and Amy are so spunky and ambitious, Beth is so sad and sweet. But Meg is traditional, often severe, perfect, and moralizing, and that can be much harder to make relatable. The whole sideplot with her buying expensive things to keep up with the joneses was so relatable and timeless. [deleted] Agree I definitely got a sense of who she was more then in other films Some actors can only show their true potential with the right director. [deleted] She definitely had one of the harder roles. Meg is the least dynamic of the sisters, so there's not much you can do to make it ""fun"" or intriguing. There were a few times where her accent was a little questionable, but otherwise she did a really great job with her solo parts involving the ball or the money troubles with her husband. I honestly can’t imagine Meg being played by anyone else now that I’ve seen the film. [deleted] Honestly I think Pugh's older Amy was amazing - definitely my favorite portrayal of older Amy-  and I actually really liked her and Chalamet together (although I think I'll always be a LauriexJo girl at heart). I also really like Pugh in general and I can't wait to see her in Black Widow, but honestly if someone told me she was in her early 30s the first time I saw her I'd probably believe them. Seeing her younger Amy portrayal just felt super weird, like a grown woman throwing a temper tantrum. I totally agree about the Beth scene! That made no sense at all. Went better this time around haha My favorite part of this was John telling Laurie to please learn Latin, because he couldn't afford to get fired and really needed the job. The way he is pleading with him is a great seed to plant for the later scene where he can't provide for what Meg wants. I was honestly pretty happy that Jo and Laurie had a little less chemistry and we saw Amy and Laurie as adults throughout because it made their pairing a lot  more palatable. I think, at least in terms of that element, this has been the best adaptation. The 1994 version with the linear timeline: the scene where Laurie introduces “his wife” and Amy enters the room is intense and surprising. I liked Gerwig’s nonlinear timeline, but some scenes did have a little less punch. Stumble into?   She wrote Lady Bird? I wish this subreddit talked about cunnilingus energy more often I’ve never seen such a comment on a movie thread and yet it is so damn accurate 😂👌🏻 Traditionally it's difficult to get letter-writing to be very cinematic...Greta tried something new. I didn't mind it.  I agree I thought Emma did really well in this film. She was believable and I enjoyed her performance a lot. Despite what history had told us, you can be talented in the world of arts without being an addict or suicidal. I’m sure he’s not a tortured soul. I liked his slow walk away right after he saw Amy in the carriage Speaking as someone who didn’t watch any of the earlier adaptations, I loved the flashback setup, and if anything, assumed this was the only way to tell the story. 

I enjoyed the head-on shots a lot. Off the top of my head, it was Friedrich (giving the books), Jo (sending Mr. Dashwood the first few chapters), and Mr. Dashwood (it wasn’t good, but please send more), right? I probably would’ve been okay with one more (maybe an Amy or Laurie one from Europe), but any more than that would’ve been too much I think. YES!! This: ""Laurie and Jo were both fighting for their friendships in different ways during changing times."". This is what I didn't get from the previous adaptation! This was so poignant and heartbreaking for me too because we see that they stopped talking because of the nonlinear timeline. I really really resonated with the childhood ending/ reminiscing thread of this version so much. >I kept trying to figure out what kind of makeup trick they were doing to make her go from youthful to lady.

Me too, it seemed like the bob haircut with pig-tail braids was a big factor, and her older self having more tied back hair The way the girls talked fast and almost on top of each other was so incredibly accurate. I coach high school women and we’ll be talking together and like 4 separate conversations at break off on top of each other >HAT spot took me way out of it, albeit briefly.  I otherwise enjoyed the movie and found it be enchanting throughout.  I felt Beth's passing was also rather sudden, she seemed on the recovery moments earlier.

Agreed! I thought the movie was mostly strong but his introduction and the use of his character was really messy for me. His introduction in the past was fine but distracting because it's Bob Odenkirk, but then he's suddenly there in the present at Beth's funeral as if he was always around in the present, even though we hadn't seen him in that timeline yet? Where was he at Beth's bedside as she was dying or consoling the family? I honestly felt that Florence Pugh overshadowed both of them in this film just because of how much she sold the loudness, naivety, and spunk of her character. She was the perfect Amy IMO and Pugh is SUCH a versatile actress but maybe I’m biased; I really liked her after seeing her in Midsommar (that sobbing is seared into my brain) and I can’t wait to see her in future projects (like in Black Widow this spring!) I get the impression that Emma Watson’s personality may not be all that different from Meg. Accent aside (she did a great job with the American accent btw), Meg and Emma have the resemblance of barring much of their romantic notions inward while doing their best to be responsible, to meet expectations of others, or to give themselves for a noble cause that benefits others. Belle and Hermonie have these traits as well.

I imagine Meg is a character that resonated with Emma, but not so much with Gerwig. Jo and Amy are Gerwig, whose passionate and fiery spirits drive them to be something more. However, Meg is an anti-Gerwig. Thus, the tamed and subdued subtleties of both Meg and Emma got syncopated by Gerwig’s necessary and merciless focus to drive her singular heroines to the finish line.

Since Emma being Emma Watson, we tend to expect something more upfront, and centered, but because her role becomes relegated to the background without an opportunity to make a strong impression we can’t help but compare her against the strong impressions we got from Ronin and Pugh, whose characters and stories were designed to give the actresses to shine and pop. Nevertheless, she actually did solid with what she has. Watson’s role wasn’t as prominent as Pugh’s or Ronan’s nor was her character as interesting. Perhaps her role didn't really call for that though? Amy and Jo had a lot more going on than Meg, and in her big scenes she did well. Just because you ""love"" her as a person doesn't mean you didn't have a skewed perception of her as a bad actor (which, by the way, she has plenty of good performances) so get off it. Anyone who actually watched this with serious eyes was able to see how well she fit here as an actor and how much she nailed Meg. I don't even want to hear anything about ""next to Ronan and Pugh"", like God. She completely held her own here, and people are being unfair to her because they were going to dislike her no matter how well she did. 

And no, I'm perfectly willing to admit when she has a bad performance (I didn't like her, or anything else really, in The Circle) but that's basically the opposite between me and her haters who will never give her credit for anything. Hey! I did that too! Watched 1917 and Little Women back to back. Perfect day for Christmas. “We could never have loved the earth so well if we had had no childhood in it, if it were not the earth where the same flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass, the same hips and haws on the autumn hedgerows, the same redbreasts that we used to call ‘God’s birds’ because they did no harm to the precious crops. What novelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known and loved because it is known?”

George Eliot, The Mill on the Floss. I don’t think the time difference between Jo rejecting Laurie and Laurie falling for Amy was all that well differentiated either. It gets glossed over that Jo rejected Laurie right after Meg’s wedding, but by the time Laurie falls in love with Amy, Meg has three year old twins. Agree, I just don't buy that Amy is that age, it really doesn't make sense. I absolutely adore him as an actor and he was very good here but I thought the same thing. I also thought that there were some poor wardrobe choices where his clothes look ill fitting. The evening clothes looked better on him as well as anything with billowy sleeves. I think they could have made more effort to differentiate his older self from his younger one. I know Gerwig is not big into continuity but I've read ( and was with folks) where many didn't buy him as an adult Laurie despite his excellent acting. I think some of the wardrobe choices unfortunately emphasized this ( like that amazing scene with Amy in her Paris studio. So good but he looked like a kid with her in the outfit they chose for him). It distracted from his acting gravitas which is a shame because from his own real life wardrobe choices you can tell he's capable of looking more mature and older. Is it intentional? Maybe, what do you all think? I know he's meant to really push a more effeminate, frail, immature Laurie in this version... Christian Bale's more gentle, vulnerable portrayal was much closer to the books. He’s much more likeable in the books! There isn’t enough screen time to accurately portray him. Amy kind of was too. They deserve each other I absolutely think Laurie really loved Amy. He did love Jo, of course, but once he was apart from her and understood that it wasn't going to happen, that love faded and he moved on. Then as he spent more and more time with Amy, something he hadn't really done before, not just the two of them, he developed feelings for her. I had a hard time with this as well, but talking about it with my mom we eventually grew to see it as: Jo was Laurie’s first love, Amy was his adult love. He loved them both but so, so differently. He’s a March opportunist. He wanted to be part of the family, and he did that. My favorite one was when Amy said “we all play a little” about the piano It's open to interpretation - in the original book, they get married and open the school together, but with the way the movie shows it, it's up to you if you choose to go with her chasing after him as reality or as her putting it into the book to make the publisher happy. I was just talking to my wife about this. 

I think it’s open to interpretation hinting to the fact that Jo was gay, but obviously a much less accepted thing back then. The publisher said endings need to have women be either dead or married. So Beth died, Amy and Meg are married, and she didn’t want that for herself. So it’s open to interpretation whether she just put that in to satisfy him and actually stayed single (and is maybe gay). Or she was just refusing to say she got married because even though she did, because she didn’t want him to win and she wanted to get her book published with the ending she wanted to write instead of it being told to her “this is how it has to be.”

You decide He is quite the fuccboi You hit the nail on the head. Although I think Kirsten dunst as young Amy was perfect! But adult amy in 1994 was cardboard. I do think Christian bale was perfect as Laurie though.... No way. 1994 to me is perfection. This one was a beautiful mess but I did enjoy it due to the performance of Saoirse. I don't know, I left with the feeling that I liked the 1994 version better, even though this one was very good. Some of the more modern dialogue was jarring, and Amy as ""young"" Amy seemed fake... Her tantrums and attitude were a little theatrical. Though I loooved Dern as Marmie, she was maybe better than Sarandon. She's great but everyone is in this film, it almost feels unfair to pick a standout. I'd also say she had the most crowdpleasing role with the funniest lines. Absolutely deserves an Oscar nom for that role. Chalamet as well No I think she actually loved her because she reminded her of herself. She stayed single and doesn't seem to like other people's contact. But she understands the struggle it is for women to live in this world without any help, especially financial. (That's my take). That's what actually happened in this story, I believe. The whole ""Under the Umbrella"" scene was fabricated. I think you will L.O.V.E. love the 90s version if this one spoke to you.  

Kirsten Dunst is amazing as young Amy, and while this movie added more from the books I missed (Beth's relationship with Mr Laurence for one), the 90s version is a straightforward retelling of the book, that only tries to give a beautiful picture to go along with a beautiful story.  Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, Christian Bale, and Gabriel Byrne fit the characters so well. No, you are not. I am not entirely sure of Laurie's intentions regarding Amy, but Jo definitely loved Laurie... as a brother. But as she stated in her monologue: she cares more about being loved than loving and even if she hadn't got any romantic feelings towards Laurie, it still hurts to know that she is not the most important person for him anymore. I think that in some earlier adaptions (and in the book?) it is more straightforward that she is just happy for the outcome as having Laurie as a member of her family was all that she wished for. However, Saoirse's and Timothée's acting choices complicate the story a little bit in my opinion (but in a good way!).

""Also I think it was bullshit when everyone is telling Jo to go after Frederick and Amy says she's never seen her happier - how about any time she's with Laurie?!""

Well, that part SHOULD seem bullshit as it is the forced ending the editor asked Jo to add to her book - I noticed after second viewing that the color grading changes from the cold blue to warm yellow after Bhaer leaves the March's house hinting that everyone encouraging Jo to go after him (and stuff that follows) is part of the book (but not necessarily part of the reality). Jo's actual happy ending is seeing her lifelong dream materializing (her novel being printed). >In the scene where Laurie reveals to Jo that he married Amy, she asks if he loves her. It couldn't be more obvious that the answer is not an enthusiastic yes. He hasn't fallen head-over-heels for Amy. He likes her, but more importantly, he always wanted to be a March, envious of how close and loving the family is, something he never had. Jo rejected him, Meg was never an option, Beth was dead. Amy was a fine settle.  
>  
>Laurie married Amy, not because he loves her passionately, but because he wanted to be loved. He knew she loved him.

If that's how they played it it's a rewrite, since Laurie clearly loves Amy in the book. Of course he's not going to come home and rhapsodize since he knows Jo has had a hard time, but Jo notices he keeps saying ""My wife"" because he loves to say it, and his face turns ""rapturous"" when he hears Amy's voice. In Europe, Laurie tries to write an opera using Jo as inspiration but he keeps failing because he keeps having fantasies of Amy instead.  There's a comical passage over Laurie's struggle and determination (in Europe) to keep his love for Jo ALIVE, because it keeps dying and he keeps seeing her in provoking, unromantic scenarios in his head instead of the deathless romantic tragedy he imagined he'd be living forever. He even tells Jo he thinks he would have been sorted out naturally (Jo as sister, Amy as wife) if he'd given himself time.   In Europe he gets so annoyed at how he's not keeping the flame alive that he writes once again to Jo, figuring that will do it, but she knocks him flat again.

Greta Gerwig actually says the difference between Jo/Laurie and Amy/Laurie IS passion. That clearly Amy/Laurie want to fuck. Whereas that's not what Jo and Laurie are about.

Laurie's initial emotional confusion makes sense. He grew up motherless, without feminine influence. Jo became this ideal - a sister, a girl, a best buddy. It's a ""romantic friendship"" in the classical Victorian sense (chaste, but emotionally intimate and inspiring). He also wants to be part of the family, AND he's ready to be in a relationship, period (I think) while Jo is not. Laurie is for her part of the idealized family of origin she never wanted to alter.

""Always wanted to be a March"" was a conceit of the 1994 film, but not in the book.  However, it's clear (as in Austen) that for Alcott the ideal romantic relationship has the couple as dear friends as well as lovers, and that would have been a tough one to pull off in Little Women if Laurie hadn't married a March. Another issue, IMO, is both Jo and Meg sort of hero worship the men they marry. Bhaer is like Jo's mother and three sisters all bundled into one. He's has so much personal warmth he can heat an entire house, he's an intellect, well read way beyond where Jo is, he's older, far more educated, and blah blah including cuddly, generous, kind and smart. He's where Jo aspires to be. And of course John Brook the tutor is so so patient with young young Meg. So it's left to Amy who actually has a marriage with an equal, which may be another reason some readers/fans think Amy unfairly made out the best. She's the only one not being tutored in life at the knee of her husband. It's more like vice versa.

PS - when you read Little Women, IF Amy has a crush on Laurie, it's very subtle and I'm not sure intentional by Alcott. It's most clear in one line.  Young Amy says something like, ""Laurie is a remarkable boy and can't be compared to regular boys."" when she expresses an opinion about boys and Jo or another sister tell her, ""But Laurie.."" The irony I found amusing is that though Amy felt she was second to Jo due to her keep getting Jo’s “hand me down” in life and having been overshadowed by Jo’s talent and ambitions. Jo probably felt she had lost to Amy somewhat when Amy was chosen by Aunt March as her companion to Europe instead. Jo probably felt a similar way again when Laurie told her he and Amy were married. Not that Jo was resentful in any way. In fact, she forced herself to be graceful in both accounts so that Amy and Laurie’s excitement wouldn’t be spoiled by her disappointments. 

Also, Ronan’s reactions were on point in both those scenes.

So what Jo had from the beginning became Amy’s. Amy was going to settle for an economical marriage but ended up with the one she loves. Yet, Jo’s losses in life eventually honed her as the writer she longed to be. This ties back to the quote from the beginning. I agree. I liked the movie for the most part until I hated the end. I am that person that loves Friedrich for Jo and thinks Laurie and Amy are a pretty good match too. If anything, the ""twist"" at the end should have been in the publisher's office and he calls her Miss Alcott. That way you can acknowledge that LMA based the book off her own life, while acknowledging she never married. Don't try to change the end of a beloved book.
It sat poorly with me because moments before we see Jo distraught over being lonely and ready to accept Laurie if he asked again. I wasn't a fan of that either but could have accepted it if not for the end, minutes later, Jo is alone away from her loved ones. To me, she didn't look happy. She seemed resigned and kind of sad, stuck reliving the past through her book to remember happy times but never truly experiencing it again. Also agreeing with the flashback critique - you’re the first I’ve seen mention this, so I thought it was just me who was confused! I caught on for the most part, but felt at times that they weren’t clearly defined past to present. There was also little to no aging in 7 years for any character, which I think added to not being able to distinguish the time jumps as easily. I recommend watching the 1994 version, there is much better character development. I liked it but I felt like it must be incredibly confusing to people not familiar with the book You're comparing the film to the source material too much. A film is supposed to be a standalone work. *Inspired* doesn't mean ""word for word adaptation""

This review doesn't convince me that the movie is bad. It only reinforces that people SHOULD watch it as supplementary material Beth was sick for a while, but then recovered by had a weakened heart, and then relapsed. I don't know if they said that in the film. agreed. i cried for basically the last 35 minutes of the film. every time i could recover and stop crying, a new scene would take place and make me start crying all over again. Why do you think hair color matters? But Jo does remain single at the end of the film. The entire scene of Jo marrying Bhaer is clearly the ending to the book she’s writing, which she includes after her publisher compels her to marry her lead off so that the book would sell. Actual Jo doesn’t marry him; the character in her book does. Amy has lots of fans, always has had.  Reviews that pretend everybody hated Amy are wrong. Readers usually pick Amy or Jo, and by no means is it always Jo. Even when Louisa May Alcott was alive, readers started complaining about not enough Amy in the sequels, and Alcott had to explain her sister May had died, and without May's laughter and suggestions, it was difficult to keep Amy vivid.  Many Jo stans blame Amy for 3 things, and only the book burning is valid. Everybody agrees it was a very bad thing for a CHILD to do, and the family let her know it. She's blamed for marrying Laurie. Jo turned him down in person and by letter. Amy's blamed for hanging out with Laurie in Europe, as if he doesn't have free will, as if he's still burning with love for Jo when Alcott clearly reports that's not the case and has a comical time showing Laurie's struggles to keep his heartbreak alive when it's fading daily. Even when apart from Amy for months he keeps thinking of Amy instead when he tries to think of Jo. And the European trip itself - the day Jo sabotaged her own chances of ever going, Amy was beside herself trying to get Jo to behave maturely and failed and had to give up. Neither girl had any idea a trip to Europe was on the line but if Jo had listened to Amy, she'd have been the one to go.

I'm glad Amy fans are making themselves heard. Whenever Little Women is filmed, most of the time the director and writer behaves as if every reader only identifies with Jo. It's just not true. Amy has an enormous number of fans. OTOH, it could be that besides Beth's death, Amy/Laurie/Jo is an easier plot point to market than ""Should Jo get married or be a writer - spoiler alert - she gets married!"" Definitely obvious, but what's a little jarring is that we're supposed to believe that Amy is a 12 yo child but we keep jumping back and forth with Florence Pugh looking pretty much the same. I love your analysis about Jo's life journey. It's the impression I got too based on the emotional conversation she had with Marmee about being so lonely... Mine too. Thought the whole ensemble was great but Florence Pugh was a real scene stealer. She’s become one of my new favorite actresses. Right? All 3 were straight up bangers I love too how the flicker of warm light from the candle as Jo writes *Little Women* marks the turning point of that warmth and energy returning to the later timeline. Every movie I go in thinking he’s just some dweeb and every movie he wins me over It is in the novel. He suspects Jo is in love with the professor. She's all I'm not in love with anyone and don't think I ever will be and he's all, yes you will and you'll be all in and I'll have to watch!

Honestly I reread it and just wanted to strangle him. Jo had been sending him unmistakable friend zone, don't go there signals for a LONG time, and Laurie chose to ignore it and basically tried to bulldoze her to where she actually got pissed. Jo beats herself up when it's someone she loves, whether Beth, Laurie or her mother, and she hates to hurt those people, but Laurie was so obnoxious IMO she lost her patience in the book. She even admitted yet - yes, maybe I will fall in love and you'll just have to freaking deal! Agreed. I love him, but it threw me off. He’s Jimmy/Saul to me Yeah, that whole casting was not one I would have recommended.  I think Odenkirk is wildly talented, but putting someone a bit more like Bill Pullman or John C. Reilly in the role would have made more sense to me and not been the record screech Odenkirk was for me. Omg when he sits at the stairs and just listens to her. So beautiful. When he couldn't bring himself to enter the house knowing she wasn't there... Anyone know what songs she was playing on Piano? The 2nd or 3rd one specifically? I agree. It kind of took me out of the movie because it was such a divergence from how I saw her in the book or past movies. She still had the wherewithal to bring food to those in need but she was 13 feeding dolls at the table and her shyness was pathological at times. Hard to pin it down. Man. Now I want to rewatch it with that in mind, that's such an interesting take, I love it! That doll was nightmare fuel tho The horse line was absolutely hilarious I'm still laughing about it I really struggled with that. Is that a normal behavior for a 13 year old girl during that time period? Or were they trying to imply something about Beth’s cognitive abilities? Or was it a normal behavior that didn’t seem normal because the actress was much older than Beth was in the books? Couldn't help but suspect that it was somehow the mom's fault. 4 days late, but when she said that I thought about how Beth was the only one who went to visit the Hummels in the first place. Agreed. I don’t think she jumped right into it with Friedrich, but I also believe they *did* eventually marry. Yes, really liked that ambiguity. Wait was it actually supposed to be ambiguous? I thought the movie was 100% saying she didn't get married, and the whole rushing to the train thing was just a fictional addition to please the publisher. Agreed. And sounded. Couldn’t really connect her as the 12 year old she is playing with her deeper voice. Agree to disgree on Dern. What I got from her was a woman who acted on principal and a real heart, but it took a major toll. You can see it on her face when she asks her girls to bring their breakfast to the Hummels - she hates doing it, hates being in the position where she can't help the Hummels without sacrificing her girls' breakfast, but it's all she has. And you can see it when she's helping the vets when she takes off her scarf. Lots of times she's kind of played like a grown up Beth - this natural saint. Dern's Marmee was a woman who made a decision to be good and makes it every day.

I'm still in shock that I liked Chalamet as Laurie. I thought so too! Popped out and had the letter box surprise with him already. What broke my immersion was Beths passing scene, there’s no way she family finds her, grieves and removes the body while jo sleeps off to the side , I know they wanted to mirror the first time she was sick but still ""Last night I was..."" It was probably me... couldn’t help it, I was caught so off guard. It didn’t even feel like he was the wrong casting for the role... but I just finished catching up on Better Call Saul, so my brain just completely froze up the second he showed up. That scene made me say to my sister next to me “gosh being a woman back then must’ve been a nightmare”. I’m a journalist working in diplomatic stuff, my sister is In med school and wants to be a neurosurgeon one day. And it is such a relief, to know that now we have a choice to do more than marry well. it's all fun and games until winter hits. then new England makes hoth look like a tropical paradiae [It was also Timothee's!](https://twitter.com/littIew0men/status/1211763920362455041?s=19) They’re going to be like Leo and Kate Winslett Chalamet portrayed it as very sympathetic. You can see it the first night when he helps Meg home and everyone is just going crazy and Marmy invites him while he waits by the door longingly



Chalamet is really proving that he’s a legit actor and it wasn’t flukes before. I think he’s going to be something special to watch for the next X decades That sounds very similar to Levin in Tolstoy’s *Anna Karenina*. He’s in love with the Scherbatsky family more than Kitty specifically. Laurie falls in love with Amy when she gives him the speech about marriage being an economic proposition for women. I bought Laurie being in love with Amy because I'm in love with Amy I bought that Bale's Laurie loved Mathis' Amy but I agree, I didn't see Chalamet's Laurie falling for Pugh's Amy. In both, Amy speaks to Laurie in a way he's not used to, especially from a woman, with his faults being called out to his face and the disappointment he's become held front and center so he is forced to really confront it... that he's a disappointment to *everyone* who cares about him, not just his grandfather.  Jo never called him out like that from what I recall, but Amy certainly did, and I think that sparked something in him.  I just didn't really see that play out as a growing attraction onscreen in this version like we saw in the 1994 version, so therefore his claim to Jo at the end that he does love her (albeit in a different way) rang a little hollow to me. Sadly envious, because Jo looked at Bhaer in a way that she never looked at Laurie.  He was more her intellectual equal whereas Laurie was always more of a brother figure to her. No joke I cried like 3 times during that movie lol Don’t forget Cats! I mean also Once Upon a Time and the Irishman Im trying to think up how Emma stone would be as Meg and honestly I can't see it. Anybody know if she's had any roles more in line with mousy and semi vain meg Nah, the many British dialects evolved during the 1700's to become non-rhotic while the American accent still retain the rhotic consonant of early modern English. 

Americans in the 1860's would have sounded like a mix of modern American English and British West Country. I don't think you are wrong, but that is the moment my feeling that Jo was gay in this version was solidified. As a kid, I hated John Brook. He was like the canary in the coal mine as to where this thing was headed. I didn't want the family to stay intact. I wanted the girls to marry rich, good looking men and maintain their independence and autonomy (Jane Austen managed to suggest her heroines pulled this off, why couldn't Alcott?) I'd have been very happy if Meg had married Laurie (as some of the family kind of wanted at first) or Ned Moffet (remember him).? If Jo had married Fred Vaughn after they clashed over croquet. Beth can still die, and Amy had my perfect ending. She was my favorite from the start so that worked for me, but I was very disappointed in jo and Meg. Never thought Jo and Laurie should be romantic. Was as irked as Jo when he got all shirt rending about her. As I posted elsewhere, when I re-read the book I paid more attention to Jo's dark period after she came home from New York, Beth had died, and the house was empty but for her parents. She was supposed to have her own life at this point. Everybody else did.  She's experiencing that pain of wanting, basically, to have stayed home forever, but home changed and everyone moved on but her. She'd hit a dead end. In this low point, the existence of Frederick Bhaer, who practically walks around with a homey fireplace trailing him, some rambunctious and appealing nephews, a charitable nature (at Xmas EVERYBODY in the boarding house gets something from him, even though he's poor himself, just as Jo's parents would have done) and a love of reading and family that evoke Jo's parents, kind of comes across as the person who is going to restore what Jo lost. Which is what she wants. I don't think she really wants to be a regular grown up in a regular house with a regular spouse. She wants the restoration of what she lost. In the person of Frederick Bhaer, she gets the best of both worlds (well, inheriting Plumfield helped) It's interesting (in the book) that Laurie's immediate reaction is of course Jo will sell Plumfield and get a good price for it, while Jo announces she wants to do her boys school. Laurie finds this a great joke and in no way is able to take it seriously. The others are more supportive.

Jo's situation is very poignant but IMO the fundamental problem was she had to leave NY, where she was beginning to thrive, and come back ""home"" where she was faced every day with the reality that it no longer existed in the form she'd wanted it to remain in forever. I think they went with fleshing out Amy/Laurie instead, but someday I'd like to see a Little Women that does both. Bhaer is never going to be a hearthrob but in the context of when he appears he's like the one shining warm point in Jo's life, the one comfort she has. She can never be sad or melancholy around him. Of course we get the signs of things to come when she sneaks into his room to darn his damn socks and sew his buttons (the book really does come all over conventional gender roles AND religion towards the end). Little Women spends a lot of time on Bhaer, and while it's never, ""Gee, I wish there were more men like Bhaer around today!"" he is very clearly the one refuge in her life as her world constricts, gets bleaker and more depressing. He lightens the mood, he's seldom melancholy, he's a positive thinker always moving forward, and he opens up the world of classical literature to Jo in a way it's never been shown to her before.  He's also very family oriented and family-supportive (his nephews). I think if a Little Women dramatization spent a bit more time juxtaposing how barren Jo's old life at home has become with how right there in Bhaer is the personification of everything's that gone, come back to her again, it would seem more natural and not tacked on. The scene where Jo runs downstairs and Beth isn’t in the chair is devastating and perfect. You’re right there with jo knowing she’s hoping Beth will get better. If by experiment you mean making a grown man cry sitting next to his teenage daughter, then yeah fucking success you sadistic bastard. Such an emotional sequence. Had the audience I saw it with sobbing. Shame the Hollywood Foreign Press didn't even nominate her. Between this and Adam Sandler getting snubbed golden globes is suspect this year Welp... [deleted] [deleted] > Meg’s husband seemed to come out of nowhere to me — I guess he was in a couple of scenes before their wedding but I felt like there was no development of his character or their relationship whatsoever.

Two days later, I know, but he was Laurie's tutor.  Usually accompanied Laurie in the bulk of the ""past"" scenes (and chaperones Marmee's visit to an injured Father March). As someone who knew nothing about the source material going in I was rooting for Amy > Jo throughout the whole film and was really happy she was the one that ended up with Laurie. It's funny reading this thread now and seeing people say she was supposed to be the unlikable one. Feel like that's a sentence that will be written about her for many years to come. I have no choice but to stan for Ms. Pugh. Yeah she's still kind of difficult to love, but much less so than in the book. That scene (while always tragic to me as a wannabe writer) was kind of awkwardly done in this one.  Maybe if they'd made her more petulant, and maybe if she'd actually looked and sounded like a snotty 12yo, it would have been more believable to me that it was the rash action of a spurned younger sister.  But Pugh looked too mature for that action and it made it feel vindictive and deliberately evil.  Maybe it needed more sobs from her to give the impression she was genuinely upset that she hurt Jo so much.  *Something*. Right? And the part where she was flattening/pinching it was perfect. Not too much emphasis but definitely noticed as true to the book Amy is meant to be the youngest! That makes sense Hah, that is an interesting coincidence. Knew Ronan was Irish and did catch her accent slipping once or twice, but Pugh I had no idea wasn't American. She did well with the accent here, I thought. It was weird to me that Meg and Jo clearly had British accents and that’s fine if Im assuming they’re actually using mid-Atlantic accents. But Amy (and Mrs. March) sound so modern day American.

Also I thought Mr. March was Kevin Costner till my friend told me at the end it was Better Call Saul lol This is the first time I’ve seen the story so I didn’t really think about the ages. I just assumed that the town only had one school for girls so it was just an all age kind thing He looked even younger to me when he returns married to Amy. I had the same thought The girl who was speaking to her in front of her desk looked to be 13-14 to me. The ones behind her looked young. I think there were different ages all in one classroom. They said repeatedly how horrible the schools for girls were, too. No, Laurie's a boy! Joey, do you want to put the book in the freezer? Is it true?  If I keep reading is Beth gonna die? What show? Her claim to critical fame was last year’s Lady Macbeth and The Little Drummer Girl (TV show). This year she starred in Fighting with My Family and Midsommar, which put her on the map. Next year she’ll be making her superhero debut with Black Widow! Thanks! I think Jo's character is so compelling because she struggles with her inner desires while also wanting to rebel against her place in society. The ""I am lonely"" speech highlights that — she understands that marriage is expected of her and doesn't want to give into those norms, but at the same time, she really has fallen in love with the Professor. I like to think of Jo's true happiness as being a published writer, and Bhaer is just the cherry on top. It felt so genuine. And makes more sense now knowing how she felt about him the whole time. I have to admit this was the first post-Harry Potter movie I actually liked her in and thought she did a really good job. I didn't think of her as Hermione at all while watching. I hope this role opens more doors for her and maybe Greta will cast her in another movie. Agreed! Here, Jo and Laurie seemed to be just playmates. I don't think OP meant stumble as in it was given to her, but just that they were worried that Lady Bird was only so good because it was perfect for Greta. Sometimes people just hit their perfect note, and no future works really resonate like the first one. Clearly not the case here. Yeah, “Lady Bird” is a semi-autobiographical story of Greta Gerwig’s life/relationship with her mother.

So...”stumble into” would be a very inaccurate way to describe her writing and directing “Lady Bird.” Oh I was thinking more the James Dean gone to soon freak accident variety



Like I hope he doesn’t but you get what I mean. He’s too good for this world Another work that takes the childhood ending/reminiscing theme prominent and centered is “Never Let Me Go” by Kazuo Ishiguro. It is a novel that was adapted into a very faithful film. Highly recommended if you have the chance! Hmm, Florence was very good but I agree with another comment that stated that she was given the most crowdpleasing role with the best lines. She also had the most to work with in terms of range because she was playing such wildly different ages from a young teen to a woman, whereas the other actors had to try and convey more subtle shades of aging and maturity. Ronan has to be angry, irritable, stubborn and standoffish and still make the audience root for Jo. I think that's a harder job. 

Likewise, Laurie is a hard role to play. In one moment he has to be boyish and smitten, the next heartbroken and sullen, the next a bit of a trainwreck, the next convincingly pulling himself together enough to be wanting to start a life with Amy. Chalamet pulls it all off so seamlessly, while not having his character be as developed on the page as Jo or Amy for obvious reasons. In his scenes with Florence, my eyes would be immediately drawn to how he was holding himself or sitting or lying. It's actually a pretty intricate and fascinating performance. Oh on the contrary I find her character very interesting the older I get and now as a wife and a mom. The scene with her and her husband after she bought the fabric and expressed frustration at their circumstance (despite her immense love for him) made me cry. I understood her so much and I felt equally strong for him in that moment. Heartbreaking.That’s what being an adult is. She feels like the only sister that actually has to be an adult in the movie and that childhood to adulthood transition is really simultaneously wonderful and sad and frustrating. As a child I found meg boring and too perfect but that character in my opinion has the most depth. It’s just more subtle. In case folks don't happen to know, George Eliot is a woman. I honestly like the chemistry between Laurie and Amy more. Jo and Laurie was too much like brother and sister like Saoirse and Timmy are irl. Laurie and Amy was electrifying I found young Amy totally unbelievable. She is a very womanly actress and her tantrums made her seem mentally ill not young. Just bizarre. She was supposed to be the youngest but she looks like the oldest of the bunch. My only real issue with ""young"" Amy was that they used the same actress as older Amy.  I think Pugh actually did a great job acting as both, but her voice is so mature that in some scenes it didn't translate that this is supposed to be a little girl. Totally agree about young Amy. I love Florence Pugh but she was a real ham as young Amy. My exwife is a huge fan of the book and she said Winona Ryder was a better Jo.  I'll have to see the 94 version and decide for myself. Saoirse definitely did the emotional labor and Pugh was the crowdpleaser and comic relief. They were great together. >Greta Gerwig actually says the difference between Jo/Laurie and Amy/Laurie IS passion. That clearly Amy/Laurie want to fuck. Whereas that's not what Jo and Laurie are about.

YES Some of this is foreshadowed by Jo saying that Amy lucks into everything. For example, Amy was pressured to marry rich by Aunt March and emotionally prepared herself for a pragmatic, economical marriage. Luckily, the man who loves her is very rich. So Amy got to “save the Marches” (financially), not disappoint her aunt/benefactor, and marry for love. 

Amy didn’t have to sacrifice anything, keeping in one with Jo’s resentment that she skates through life. It was. They do clearly say we thought she got better but it weakened her heart It helps create the atmosphere for me, and the characters Yes, I loved the book as a kid but never became aware of ""Amy hate"" until the miniseries a couple of years ago. Sure, I identified with Jo when I was young since I was one of the older siblings and always writing, but even then I could see where Amy was coming from -- and even the book burning, while awful, is something done by a twelve-year-old. I think Amy has suffered from most of the adaptations casting an adult actress in the role who can't always play that young convincingly, so her spite at Jo for not taking her to the play ends up looking less like a frustrated, bratty preteen and more like a blooming sociopath. It's impossible to imagine even a fifteen year old Amy doing that. But I think most honest readers will see that there's at least a bit of Amy in them -- and that's not a bad thing. 

I did miss Meg letting Aunt March have it about John Brooke, and Amy writing her will when she's stuck at Aunt March's. But you can't have everything in a movie's runtime and I thought they did a good job. I haven’t seen Little Women yet but Florence Pugh is AMAZING in Midsommar I thought she gave the best performance of film. Scene-stealer is so accurate. Everything she said and every expression she gave felt so genuine What was the third? I only know this and Ladybird For real. He definitely has that gormless pretty boy vibe but by the end of this and Call Me By Your Name I was convinced by his talent. this hit me. when he says that line I teared up. it was just so beautifully said. When the people you love are gone, and these places you shared brought joy and laughter. and to know that person is no longer be there physically, is just crushing. That was the part of the film that got me the most, and I thought it was beautifully done. Really good writing and directing to feel all the emotion in that storyline. it’s right on the cusp when girls are just starting to give up childish things, or at least it was when i was a 13 year old girl. i still loved my stuffed animals (although i still love my stuffed animals). maybe it seemed a little off because, like you said, the actress is much older. To be fair, it was a different time period. Give up dolls for what? Not like there’s much to do as a poor teenage girl in the 1800s. Don't tell mama I thought it was heavily implied that she became sick because of her help to the Hummels. I haven't read the book or any other adaptation though. But don't we see him again at the school? I took it 100 percent the other way, since you see him at the school and acknowledged by Jo in reality afterwards. So she wrote the story how she believed it should have been, but when forced to change it just changed it to the sappy reality. I forgot she was suppose to be 12 wow. I found it a little disjointed when Dern's Marmee admitted to Jo that she sees a lot of herself in Jo, especially her quickness to anger, because you never *ever* saw Dern lose her composure elsewhere.  Maybe if we'd seen flashes of it, then her internal calming tendencies taking over, it would have made more sense, but it felt like it came out of left field.  If anything, I saw Dern's Marmee as having much more in common with Meg than anyone else. The scene doesn't have to take place as you say.  The death could have happened and all that, body moved etc.  But then an exhausted Jo goes up to sit by the bed in disbelief and nods off.  She wakes, an empty bed, and goes down to the kitchen only to see, yes, it wasn't a dream and reality hits and Beth is really dead. > there’s no way she family finds her, grieves and removes the body while jo sleeps off to the side

You ever sat beside someone slowly dying, for hours and hours? I have, and you can't imagine the toll that constant grief, worry, and sleep deprivation take on your body. There were times I collapsed that I could have slept through a revolution in the hospital. Yeah, I felt that was a little strange too, but would’ve been equally fucked up if they saw Beth dead there and left her for Jo to find. Like that shit will haunt your nightmares finding a corpse of a loved one That's adorable. I adore him. His performance in Call Me By Your Name was absolutely outstanding, the movie itself changed my life. Funnily enough this is actually the first role I really loved Chalamet in and it changed my mind in favor of him He at the very least realizes that he, also being rich, can solve the Marches' money problems himself. Which also adds to her message that he can ""choose"" who he loves. I cried the whole movie. Couldnt stop. I'd stop crying, then something would happen and it would start again for a completely different reason. 
 I didn't expect this to be as emotionally complex as it was Never forget Cats. and marriage story Meg is not mousy. She's not interesting, but she is the most classically pretty of the sisters, as described by Alcott. In that sense, Watson is probably better cast than Stone. God, as a lesbian, I related *so much* to Jo... the whole speech when Laurie proposed. How upset she was both with him and herself. How she tells him that she would love him if she could, but she has tried and just can't. Oof. I felt that. I've been there. The one thing that bothered me with that scene was how on earth did Marmie discover and move Beth's body out of the room without waking Jo?? [deleted] Hearing the grown man behind me try to stifle his tears and me 100% sympathizing was a highlight of the movie. Before I saw 1917. Holy shit that film It's worth noting that she did write them though, so she has a very good sense of cinema. ELIO!!!! Breaks my heart every time. Definitely helps that she has such good comic timing. She was hilarious in this film. Pugh’s American accent in Midsommar was perfect. In this film I thought the way she said “won’t” was a bit off, but that’s the stupidest nitpick ever Jo had a British accent? Lol that’s funny considering Saul once managed to convince a woman that he was Kevin Costner. Was there any indication in the movie how much time had passed? I also assumed they were supposed to be roughly the same age in every scene but things were just told out-of-order I know, I was so confused at first.  I don't know if it was the outfit or what, but he looked so young when he reveals he's married to Amy. Friends. Joey reads Rachel's favorite book Little Women and Rachel reads Joey's favorite book The Shining, and they both get really into it. I don’t think she fell in love with the professor. It was clear she didn’t want her character to be married in the end because she herself still didn’t want to get married. She even said she wants to “stay consistent” to the rest of the story and not do that. The scene of her running in the rain to see the professor was clearly a fantasy, written up because the book would sell better that way, but that’s not how her real life went down. In her real life, she didn’t need to get married to be satisfied and happy. I haven't read the book, but it seemed like it come out of the blue when she was suddenly interested in him near the end. I had a hard time seeing any age difference in Laurie. He seemed to be 16 throughout the film. He played the immature lovestruck boy just fine, but the lazy rich boy in Europe, or the serious husband were not convincing. I absolutely agree with everything you said. While Jo and Amy make good romantic heroines, Meg is the every women who chooses to give everything they got to be a responsible, supportive, and nurturing daughter, sibling, wife, and mother. She took upon a path Jo disagreed with and a husband Aunt March disapproved. She took upon an undaunted task of creating a healthy supportive environment of love for others. The story beat about Meg wanting that fabric to make a dress only highlights how she constantly put others ahead of herself. It also highlights how human she is and the dreams she is giving up everyday. Yet, Meg is rational enough to know the vanity of the former and the substantial sustenance of the latter. Both Meg and the role of Meg are thankless but required. Thankfully, Meg found a man who is willing to sacrifice and love as much as she does for the very same purpose, and actually adores and appreciates her too. Unfortunately, few would appreciate Emma Watson for the effort she put into the role. Greta Gerwig said in an interview: “I think Amy and Laurie have a lot of sexual chemistry. They want to fuck!” She’s not wrong! lol. Timothée has way better chemistry with Saoirse in real life than Florence though. I don't totally buy the brother/sister thing, they met on a set where they had to make out on a bed in their underwear. Not saying there's anything going on between them at all btw, but they definitely have chemistry that goes beyond familial. No way. His chemistry with Florence wasn't bad but him and Saoirse are absolutely electric together. There's meant to be a bit of a sibling bond between Jo and Laurie but it's definitely not just that. Gotta disagree with your ex-wife. I love Winona (who doesn't) but that's one of my least favorite performances for her. That Saoirse scene talking about how she's lonely is something maybe 5 people in the world can do Yeah but Pugh really brought the weight when she needed to. So much about this performance I absolutley love. She's really funny as the younger version, but when she's older and in Europe you can really feel her built up emotions in every scene she's in with Chalamet. Her voice is also completely different. I think there's nothing but great performances but Pugh is easily the best and probably the top of my supporting actress for the year. Amy didn't luck into anything. In the book it's obvious she is every bit as strong and talented and courageous as Jo. Jo sabotaged her own chances of going to Europe. Nobody wants to give someone an opportunity like that and find out they're unappreciative, ungrateful, unwilling to prepare for it, and disdainful of effort. Amy had to drag Jo to pay a visit to Aunt March and Aunt Carroll, because they were dressed up and Amy thought they'd appreciate the compliment of a formal visit from their neices. Jo wanted to blow it off - Aunt March gave her a pain.  During the visit Jo said she detested the French language (silly slippery language), hated favors because she hated being obligated to others, and was overall obnoxious and clearly chafed at being in the company of these women. Amy was polite, and appreciative that Aunt March still let her speak to her French maid to improve her language. This was the visit that changed the aunts' minds from taking Jo to taking Amy, as they spelled out in their letter to Marmee. They'd wanted to take Jo but since she ""hates French"" ""hates favors"" and otherwise acted like she didn't want to be obligated to anybody, they figured Amy would appreciate it more.

Amy is aesthetics and Jo is drama. People seem to think Amy is polite because she's manipulative but there's absolutely no evidence of that in the book at all. She appreciates tact, manners and good taste - that's her nature. Greta Gerwig says that Amy saying she's not wise but ""observant"" is key. Jo can't read a room and gets in her own way. Amy is much more considerate and respectful of others. Long before the trip to Europe it's clear Amy is popular with men and women. The episode at the fair shows why. She took her demotion with good grace, and after Jo ordered Laurie and his friends to save the day, Amy instructed them to be fair and do the same to the person who had humiliated her, since she hated being petty and tacky and wanted to be a ""gentlewoman."" Jo could have gone to Europe. Jo could have married Laurie. That she didn't do either was her decision and choice. I had serious Midsommar flashbacks when she was wearing a flower crown at Meg's wedding and also when she had a look of satisfaction when burning Jo's novel. She has the most amazing whole-faced cry of any actor I've ever seen Brooklyn I’m pretty excited for Dune. I hope he’s great in that. Equally painful when you remember how he said that she reminded him of his daughter that passed away. He had to experience that same pain twice. That’s the case, yes. But it was still selfless and that’s what I think her sisters were referring to. We do see him at the school, watched it today and he was definitely there. Oh, wow. I didn’t take that into consideration, so thanks for letting me know He should’ve been nominated for Beautiful Boy. Glad I’m not the only one. This story is an emotional roller coaster for me. Marriage Story is more your standard amount of stacked cast I’d say I've seen a lot of people pass. You can be very quiet and tactful if it means slightly lessening the blow of having to be the one to discover your loved one is gone. Watched my dad slowly die. Grief saps the energy from everyone around it and at some point the worry and stress makes you sleep deeply if you want it to or not. It’s quietly powerful. Been a good year for him between this and Wonderful Day in the Neighborhood. First flashback they say 7 years earlier It's definitely supposed to be ambiguous, but I don't believe it's outright fantasy. There are enough interactions and hints to Jo's feelings for it to go either way (i.e. Laurie's confession, Bhaer critiques of her book/their interactions as a whole, Jo's ""lonely"" speech).

I think Greta means to leave it up for interpretation, which I really appreciate. Personally, I'm a bit of a romantic, so I enjoy the idea that Jo gets to have her cake and eat it too. It wasn't as big a deal in the book. That part of the book spends most of the time showing how perfect Bhaer is. Gives her Shakespeare, takes her to dinner parties full of her sort of people. Then she leaves NY because Beth needs her. She wants to take Beth to the mountains to get her better, but Beth is too weak to go. They go to the seashore and everybody knows it's The End. The house is lonely, Beth is dying, her parents are heartbroken, all her sisters are gone, Beth dies.  Alcott then does this big thing about how brave spinsters are but when you hit 25 and aren't married, it can be pretty harrowing. Jo either isn't or can't write at this point so she's in her early 20s and has no life. She's like the Miss Havisham of the March sisters. I'm not sure why she doesn't go back to NYC - her parents need her? She's not sure Frederich Bhaer wants her back? She's lost both her new life in NYC which suited her perfectly, and she's living with the ghosts of her old life. She's totally stuck so it's like, ""If I'd said yes to Laurie I wouldn't be alone."" She admits she doesn't love him anymore than she did when she turned him down but at this point she needs a lifeline. every Greta Gerwig interview is incredible lmao Winona does a much better job of selling the ending with the Professor - I didn’t really buy Saoirse wanting to be married at the end. With that said however I am so happy someone else also loves the “I am lonely” scene with Laura Dern, it was magnificent. Also the scene when she puts on the Shakespeare coat and gets to work... 👌 Love you for saying this! I don’t get the venom towards Amy for marrying a person who loves her and who she loves. Jo chose to reject Laurie, knowing deep in her heart they would be unhappy. Laurie wasn’t a lover to Jo, he was a dear friend up until the very moment she was so grief-stricken that she thought marrying Laurie could make her happy. 

Amy was undeniably a brat, didn’t have much luck (got whippings/humiliated at school) but she is charming. And she is good at it. Amy earned her Europe trip where Rome “took all the vanity out of [her]. 

In the book, it was clear that Amy in France once cared about what Laurie thought of her. But resolved that she cared more about calling out Laurie’s laziness. She didn’t really give a damn anymore if he would hate her. She just had to tell him off for his sake. 

In Gerwig’s screenplay, she had Amy assert herself to Laurie in other ways so he can really, fully see her. And it worked. 

As Amy said, love doesn’t just happen to a person. Amy and Laurie did some introspection in their time away. 

They saw their own faults and worked on it. They happened to see each others’ greatness as well.

And that’s how they recognized the love that’s in front of them. 

(if i may add, their relationship’s framework / introspection is like what Monica and Chandler have/did.) I also had Sharp Objects flashbacks when Beth was wearing the flower crown at Meg's wedding. That and when she's sick in bed. Which probably has her best acting too. I assumed the school scene because of how it was framed was also part of the happy ending that never happened The school parts were filmed in the same warm-nostalgic-flashback color grading, and the scenes at the publishers were filmed in the cold-present color. So you can either interpret both of them as happening, or the school parts as just a fantasy of what-could've-been vs harsher reality. I think that’s the point. I think that ending was forced on her character by the publisher, so it works that you don’t think she didn’t want to marry him, cause in real life the author never got married. I kept looking for a dollhouse to show up! I think the school part was ""real"" and not part of the book. 

It would make sense for him to be there either way considering he is a teacher and they are friends so that adds up and the book was about their lives and she was given the house. That happened post book publishing and they say that ""Under the Umbrella"" is the last chapter in the book which is when she goes after him. 

It's possible that is supposed to be part of the book but I think it's just their lives after the book and he's there because in the real book he's an important character for Jo so they left it a bit ambiguous but it's heavily implied they don't marry especially considering Alcott never married and that's who Jo is based on. I think they go back to the orange tint because the blue was set up to establish the mood around Beth's passing, it wasn't meant as orange=book, blue=real. It was more of the separation of moods and a visual way to show what time period is being shown but everything pre book publishing is presumably in the book IMO. ",1
109,"But really though, do u wanna build a snowman... papa can u hear me... is Ryan Reynolds the first to point this out??  My favorite callback was the bags of coke next to the cure for blindness  Never thought Dolly Parton could be the perfect soundtrack to violence. Using the song from the Logan OST at the end when wade was dying was a nice touch.

He was really dead set on getting that wolverine moment lol. I can’t even explain my favorite part; I just loved it so much. Cable was badass, the references were a hundred fold, the X-Force almost immediately dying horrible deaths was hilarious, Juggernaut was awesome, the X-Men cameo was hilariously unexpected, just.. everything was fantastic in my eyes.

Edit: that end credits scene too. That had me rollin’.

Edit edit: How could I forget the joke about Rob Liefeld not being able to draw feet? I swear I was the only one who laughed at that one in a packed theater. Its been a great year for Josh Brolin. Cable was fucking incredible. Juggernaut vs Colossus was fantastic, ""I'll melt you down and make you my cock ring"". I was not expecting the actual X-Men in this. That was fucking hilarious. The James bond intro was fantastic. Can’t get over when he signs the kid’s cereal box Ryan Reynolds  Holy shit that Post Credit Scene  The X-Force was a better Suicide Squad than Suicide Squad. It's the motherfucking JUGGERNAUT, bitch!

But seriously, awesome surprise villain cameo, with a nice dose of foreshadowing I think the biggest laugh in my theater was the Baby Instinct leg cross. ~\*~\* Bye, Yukio! \*~\*~ The version of ""Take On Me"" used in the movie was really fantastic... Honestly quite an emotional scene bolstered by the beautiful music The X-Force dying after the high winds parachuting was honestly the most hilarious part of this movie. Juggernaut totally woke up at the end right? Jokes aside, I appreciated how many surprises were left in the movie and how little we got out of the trailer. The trailer focused on the X-Force team which made their sudden deaths hilarious. We had no idea Juggernaut was in this. There were even scenes in the trailer with Morena that weren't in the movie so even though she dies right off the bat I was still guessing if she'd come back some how. 

I love to be surprised at the movies and this was full of fun surprises. When Wade hugs the guy that just killed his girl, simply because he needed a hug. That shit was heavy af

Then he rolls him into an oncoming truck

   Brad Pitt being vanish was the most unexpected thing ever haha loved the movie.. it managed to recycle some things from the first yes but still keep so much charm and hilarious jokes at every scene, so some of the repeated jokes didn’t even matter. It’s just a badass hilarious and one of a kind super..vigilante movie  The parachuting scene killed me Kudos to the marketing. There was a lot of misdirection in the trailers. Like, in a surprisingly good way. Deadpool going back in time to kill X-Men Origins Deadpool and Ryan Reynolds is seriously one of the loudest laughs I’ve had in a theater!  Was the scene with Juggernaut being thrown into the water a big pun?? Cause they shoved a Cable up his butt and threw him into a Pool?? I loved the cameo in the X mansion  For those of you who missed it, the hick talking to Alan Tudyk was Matt Damon slapped in a shitload of makeup. Lost my mind when that clicked for me. 

Had a blast with this movie. Think I liked it just a bit more than the first.

Edit: Thought it might be fun to share this. Before I saw the movie I remembered hearing there was no scene at the very end of the credits but decided to stay until the end just in case. Turns out just about everyone else in the packed theater did too. Meanwhile right when the credits started this guy who worked for the theater was coming in to collect garbage and stood at the side of the auditorium near the exit. Right when it ended and me and my buddy realized we watched the entire credits for nothing, I got up and headed for the exit (we were pretty well the first ones out because of where we were sitting) and before we left I asked the dude if he knew that we were all waiting around for nothing and just didn't speak up and he started laughing and was like ""Yeah, and I'm gonna do this every time!"" Hi Wade 👋 

Hi Yukio 👋 

Bye Wade 👋 

Bye Yukio 👋  Directed by one of the guys who killed John Wick's dog. Russell Collins? He is a bad egg. His history of offences and reoffences is too long to list. We’re talking graffiti-ing. Littering. Smashing stuff. Burning stuff. Breaking stuff. Stealing stuff. Throwing rocks. Running away. I've never felt more cheated out of Terry Crews in my entire life. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I like that Deadpool said something about cleaning up the timeline when he killed his X-Men Origins self. I feel like Deadpool messing with the timeline could explain all the other inconsistencies in the X-Men Franchise.

X-Men cameo was great!

I didn’t feel like Vanessa had a big enough part in this movie, but hopefully the credits scenes mean we’ll see more of her!

Russell torching Deadpool and turning his costume gray was a great nod to the gray suit he wears in many X-Force comics! When a Fox made Deadpool sequel has more MCU references than the entirety of the Netflix Marvel series'.  When the Xmen cast showed up behind Deadpool then Beast closes the door.. the whole theater lost it [deleted] I’m glad Cable was able to grow as a character and overcome his racist ways. Here’s hoping he and Domino can get together as they were an item in the comics! :) Confirmed. Vanessa is stuck inside the soul stone. I hope I'm not the only one who appreciates how creative and well shot the action was. 

2 moments that really wowed me.   
1. Deadpool's arm is broken and he uses that to his advantage to choke his enemy.   
2. Deadpool drives his sword through the dash of a car to press the accelerator of it.

There is one other moment I can vaguely recall where 2 characters are moving around each other to dispatch bad guys.

Those are just 2 moments in a film filled with superbly choreographed action.  Action was spot on in D2. 
 Can't wait to see X-Force kick some ass!

...aaaaaaaaand they're dead. Three biggest laughs for me:

1) ""I wanna find a planet of people who are worse at me than everything. Then I can be their Superman.""

""You mean Canada?""

""You shut your goddamn trash mouth!""

2) ""You killed Black Tom, you racist son of a bitch!""

3) The X-Men cameo. Domino really surprised me... She was FANTASTIC!!  We should note that there is, in fact, an extensive mid-credits scene. Also that people should stay til the end because that last song during the credits Is fantastic That Green Lantern bit at the end had the whole theatre cheering I died when he brought up the DC Martha thing. 9/10 It feels good to live in the golden age of comic book movies. Who could have guessed Deadpool and Deadpool 2 would even exist, let alone be emotionally intense and fucking hilarious? This is a good timeline. Especially now that Green Lantern never happened.

Also, any timeline problems in the X-men movies can be explained by Deadpool dicking around with a time machine.  I admittedly laughed way more than I should have seeing Vanisher jump out of an airplane. Am I wrong or is Peter the only one DP went back to save, payoff to telling him that he wouldn't let anything happen to him.  One thing I was pleased with is that they kept most of their surprises out of the trailer. When X-Force started dying it was completely unexpected and hilarious. Also unless I missed some marketing didn't think Juggernaut would be in it. 

More movies need to do this, imagine how awesome seeing the Hulk would have been in Thor: Ragnarok if you didn't know he was in it? I’m amazed they were able to keep the villain unspoiled by the trailers as well as many plot points.  
And I love Yukio. I kind of want an impaled Logan music box... So umm with the ending is Vanessa alive?  One of my local theaters had a Deadpool double feature for $14 last night and it was well worth the cost.

After seeing the two films back to back I definitely preferred Deadpool 2 over the original.

I really loved how after being >!split in half!<, Deadpool spent the rest of the film with his suit >!duct taped back together. !< such a great detail.  *Give me a bow and arrow and I’m basically Hawkeye* 😂 I'm not too familiar with how Domino's powers work but when she landed, it looked like she was stealing the luck from everyone around her so she could be lucky. Like all of those car crashes had to have killed all of those people just so she could live. I makes me think that she stole the luck from X-Force so she could survive the high winds and land safely.
 ""Shirt-cocking it"" My favorite new term. 

I was gasping for air in that parachute scene. Good God! 

* ""...Jared Kushner"" 
* ""...he even runs like a ~~pedophile~~ pervert...""

edit: Having seen it twice - Cable says pervert, not pedophile. Can Ryan Reynolds and his team take over the X-Men franchise? They clearly give a shit about the characters.. I'm so happy Colossus is legit in his movies and not ""peter-occasional metal man"". And Juggernaut, holy shit. 

So many references.. So many jokes.. There's even some subtle humor among the loud stuff. 

When that Juggernaut theme played I thought I was hearing things but no.. It really is a Chorus singing ""Holy shit balls"".  ""Brown Panther"" Did anyone get surprisingly emotional at the ""reunion"" at the end between Vanessa and Wade?  I started giggling hearing the acoustic version of ""Take on Me,"" but then when she fought back tears saying, ""Kiss me like you miss me, Red,"" I damn near lost it.

Well played, movie. A wonderful improvement over the first. Can we just take a moment to talk about Josh Brolin's fucking amazing voice? My god, man. All I could hear was Thanos through the whole film, and hearing Thanos say ""Dubstep is for pussies"" and ""There's a knife in your dick, yeah"" had me *rolling*. Deadpool killed it as Ryan Reynolds. In my opinion, that was the best post credits scene ever I officially love josh brolin. All I could hear when he spoke was Thanos and it was great, especially when deadpool called him thanos. I uhhh have a crush on Domino now? Ok be honest. Who else wanted Taika Waititi to be the future, evil version of the kid? I loved when they turned Deadpool’s suit grey like his Uncanny X-Force version in the end. ""Hey big guy, sun's getting real low"" > Actually, I was fighting this caped badass, until I found out that his mom is also named Martha

I laughed so hard at this and that Jared Kushner joke. I'm Batman Now I can never unsee Ryan Reynolds with a baby penis. Thanks movie. So was Vanisher Brad Pitt or am I crazy?? Did anyone else notice that the dial on Cable's gun went to 11? Can we agree that the Deadpool movies have the best opening credits ever? This one might take the cake for the best closing credits as well. 

I also really *really* love the fact that someone had to have spent a good amount of hours animating Deadpool's toddler genitals. The ""Cable is a racist"" running gag was the funniest joke (s) in the whole movie ""Who are you?"" ""I'm Batman"".. Completely unexpected haha  Holy shit that was Brad Pitt ""Dubstep is for pussies"" 
""But I like dubstep!"" 
*Bangarang by Skrillex plays* Domino showing how luck can be a superpower. That was incredible writing. domino though 😍😍 That joke about Frozen stealing the melody of “Papa Can You Hear Me?” throughout the movie was so hilarious.  So, during the X Men cameo, it was the cast from Apocalypse, which took place in the 80s. This movie obviously took place in modern time. The timeline in this series is so absolutely fucked and I love it. At this point they've just said fuck it and are doing whatever. LOVED the X-men cameo, Brad Pitt's cameo, the end credit stuff, and I really liked the movie... And DID ANYONE notice that the music that deadpool was dying to was THE SAME PIECE OF MUSIC that Logan actually dies to in LOGAN??? I know that's gonna go over like 95% of people's heads but I absolutely fucking loved that and it cracked me up so much!  Did anyone else think the whole ""your heart isn't in the right place"" thing was going to turn out literal and that's how he'd survive being shot? Could've been some cool foreshadowing IMO. Thank god that he Killed Ryan Reynolds when he read the Green Lantern script ""Hey big guy, the sun's gettin' real low!""

Slayed me DP saying “Scoutmaster Kevin?” When seeing that guy’s dick was amazing. Probably why he didn’t want to name his child Kevin. The X-Men cameo was fucking gold. Deadpool 2 had a better James Bond opening credit sequence than the last James Bond movie. Jesus Fuck, I was probably one laugh-cough away from throwing up during the skydiving scene. What a fucking scene!  I loved when he was getting the cocaine from the floorboards, he also had the cure for blindness hidden in there. [deleted] That green lantern bit at the end had me rolling  I just wanna say that the use of the acoustic version of Take on Me was fantastic. Wade’s stash of drugs and guns is hidden right next to... the cure for blindness.  “I’m gonna rip you in half”

*proceeds to rip Deadpool in half* 

Great delivery by Juggernaut on that one, I lost it  Did anyone else think that the use of Vanessa as [death](#spoiler) was a beautiful nod to the comics that [Thanos made deadpool immortal so he couldnt be with death](#spoiler) Wasn’t the music during Wade’s “death” scene the same as the music at the end of Logan? The Holy Shit Balls song when the Juggernaut was fighting Colossus was hilarious and I was laughing the whole time. Too bad it was drowned out by the action but glad it replayed at the very end of the credits.  I laughed so hard when he said ""Hey big guy, Sun's getting real low"" while fighting with Juggernaut. rofl I think the X-force dropping in is my favorite scene of the movie. It lampoons all the ""superheroes team up for the good of the planet or whatever"" trope and then immediately kills most of them off to keep the story pared down. 

Also, Cable was pretty good.  dubstep's for pussies. Jesus. I loved it. Saw a lot of interviews where the cast referred to the movie as ""bold"" and I'd say that covered it. 

Like any movie, it isn't perfect and there are definitely some bones to pick. But I think that it was really good as a whole.

I fucking loved Domino in this movie. I know there was some questions when Zazie Beetz was cast, but she fucking nailed it. I really liked the care-free attitude that came along with her life of good luck. She's a lot less serious than her comic counterpart, but still just as skilled. I think this iteration of Domino works perfectly with Ryan's Deadpool and I can't wait to see more of her. 

Josh killed it as Cable. He can really nail that gruff, gravely voice. The CGI around his arm was *suuuuuuuper* well done, and I can't believe I got to see fucking Cable on the big screen. Childhood me just had his mind blown. I really like how he was kind of stranded in our timeline, but the extra credits scene might have something to say about that. Again, I can't wait to see more Cable in future movies. 

The humor in this movie was pretty on point. They might have had one or two too many self-referential jokes, but it wasn't too bad. Julian Dennison was phenomenal as Russel. Him and Wade went really well together, and he had a couple one-liners that were really memorable. ""Damn it feels good to be a gangsta!'

I can't believe they killed off the entire squad! That kind of blew my mind. I figured Peter would die, but I thought Bedlam and Shatterstar might be around for the long haul. I would have loved to see more Terry, but it was worth it to have that unexpected moment where I'm sitting there in shock. ""Did they really just kill half the squad?"" I can see this being a contentious thing to do, but I was really into it. I did not see it coming, and only in a Deadpool movie could they build up this hero squad and then kill half of them because of high winds. 

And HOLY SHIT COLOSSUS SAID FUCK. That was so fucking hilarious. Hit fight with The Juggernaut was *everything* I wanted it to be. To see those two really going at each other was fucking **intense.** I like that he was dented in the head at the end, just walking around like that. What a trip.

I feel like I want to hop into a full rundown of the movie from beginning to end, talking about all the highlights. I really loved this movie. 

I can't wait for future X-Force movies. I like that they might be willing to do some dirty work, but still bring some heroism and levity to the situation. I hope Colossus becomes a staple of the movie version of X-Force. Yukio and Negasonic as well. The lineup of them all at the end when Wade is coming back to life is a **solid** squad to build X-Force around, and maybe add 1 or 2 more ""big-league"" players. 

I have so much more I want to say. I just want to gush about this movie. Probably going to go back and see it again this weekend.  HI YUKIO Is no one going to mention how hilarious the James Bond opening was?  Everything Josh Brolin said or did as Cable was awesome.

But especially this one.

>""God, he even runs like a child molester"" We still have Bowie The end credits scenes alone were worth the money Wade wasn't joking; the cure for blindness really is stashed with all of his cocaine. [deleted] Shortest but greatest cameo by brad pitt 🎶Oh holy shitballs🎶 [deleted] The scene with X Force all dying immediately after jumping out of the plane is straight up MacGruber territory and I loved it! My gosh the theme songs in the credits. Don't leave:

The credits have an X Force theme song that features the voice of cartoon Wolverine saying ""X Force"" over and over. And there's and juggernaut theme with holy shitballs chanted over and over  Baby Legs Deadpool’s “Basic Instinct” moment was a thing of grotesque beauty

Also: Peter’s slowly-into-the-pool-style helicopter exit was gold Anyone else appreciate him calling cable ''one eyed willie''? cuz, goonies? and he has one eye? That was great. The plane-jump was one laugh after another, the babylegs scene just kept getting more and more insane, and the movie has the best credits scene in history.

Story was surprisingly good, too. I liked the first Deadpool plenty, but it was really just a showcase for the character; plot wasn't all that much, you were there for Wade and if he wasn't your cup of tea there was no reason to watch the movie.

This movie has a story that could actually work even if played completely straight. Telling it with Deadpool is like dipping fries in your frosty, it doesn't sound like it'll work but the results are surprising.

Also me and everyone I know are gonna spend the next month saying ""Hi, Wade!"" and ""Bye, Wade!"" to each other with bright smiles, so that'll be fun.. Josh Brolin is becoming my favorite actor ever. I already loved a lot of the roles he’s had and he keeps killing it  I loved the song during the colossus vs juggernaut fight. It was basically just people singing ""holy shit!"".  The music playing during Deadpool's death scene is the same as that of Logan's. Deadpool killing Ryan Reynolds with a shit\-eating grin on his face when he gets the Green Lantern script was a perfect capper to this movie.  ""Dubstep is for pussies"" made me laugh so fucking hard. 

The bit when X men get the one second cameo was amazing as hell  [deleted] This movie was hilarious. The baby leg scene was probably the hardest I've laughed at a movie in a while. I'm not sure about anyone else but the xforce parachute scene was the funniest thing I've seen in a LONG time.  The movie was damn near perfect. The acting was on point, the kid especially has a bright future ahead, I really hope he does. The CGI was amazingly done and the jokes were non-stop. More 4th wall breaks than the first one really added that extra bit of Deadpool-ness. 

Few things did bother, like Colossus not immediately coming to aid when Juggernaut was mentioned. Like that isn't a name you just roll over in bed and cover your ears to. Also while I really appreciated the love connection between Vanessa and Wade transcending death and all that...i really really wanted it to be Lady Death instead.  The scene where all of the X-Force members die was hilarious and so out of left field, but I’m a little disappointed that we won’t get to see them in later films. I was kind of looking forward to seeing Terry Crews as Bedlam.

Also, I did not expect to get misty eyed during a Deadpool film. The “Take on Me” scene was very emotionally effective. Hi Yukio!

Hi Wade!

*moves hands magically* I loved Wade and Yukio's relationship so funny  The bit where he puts the massive bag of cocaine in his mask and punches it had me rolling. Also, fine meaning 
Fucked up
Insecure
Needy 
Emotional 
  I died at 
 I like how Deadpool went back in time and saved Peter, but no other member of x-force.  [deleted] Killing off the advertised team at the beginning was a stroke of genius. Also the Brad 0itt cameo was great.

EDIT: I' K33PING THE TYPO!!! That Brown Panther line isn't going to get enough credit Best James Bond intro to date BRAD PITT OUTTA NOWHERE I have to say, when Colossus decides to fight dirty, he fights really dirty. Yes, yes he is.

We need a dubstep mashup. That was great! I loved how it was exactly how he described it, too. [deleted] The best part about that is that it worked even if you don't remember the line from the first one, I watched the movie and laughed about him having hidden coke and the cure for blindness in the floor of the blind coke addicted woman, then yesterday I rewatched the first movie \(because you can never get enough Deadpool\) and realized that he actually said that it would be there, which made both that line and the scene I'd watched the day prior all the more funny. I saw it as a double feature, so all call backs were so fresh and made it so much better. That might have been my first LOL of the movie.  'hit it Dolly' I didnt even catch that That bit at the beginning too where he has the model of Wolverine's death scene had me in stitches, and it was only a detail in that scene. 'Who could of known the wind would be so bad?'
  
'Everyone on the plane knew. And everyone off the plane too' It was refreshing for the character to just turn on a dime without wasting a bunch of time on why. Kept things moving at a good pace.  “He even runs like a pervert!”

I lost it at that line. Brolin needs to be in more comedies. Motherfucker blew it out of the water as two Marvel characters. A rare feat indeed > Its been a great year for Josh Brolin. Cable was fucking incredible.

Brolin is having an epic year. Thanos, Cable, Sicario dude [deleted] But he was a racist! He killed Black Tom!  Juggernaut called him a ""Mother Fucking Commie""

I just about died laughing. Every line he had was fucking gold.  ""I'm gonna rip you in half now.""  ""Oh my god that's such a Juggernaut thing to say!"" Apparently Juggs was mocaped and voiced by Ryan Renolds. [deleted] Not to mention the score for the Juggernaut fight. 

You can't stop him

Ohhhhoooo

You can't stop this mother fucker 

Holy shitballs

Oh holy shitballs

I've never laughed so hard during a fight scene. Their faces, I need a still of that lmao.  At first i thought, wait that timeline is not right. Then I remembered it was Deapool and is poking fun at X-men timeline discrepancies. There was a bond reference in the credits too.  
  
Pool. Dead pool me and my mate laughed our ass off during that one. we were saying that ""ashes"" sounds like a james bond movie theme song as joke weeks before watching the movie. [deleted] What’s weird is that kid is in another X-men property as a young Legion. Also known as David Haller, Professor Xavier’s child. With Wolverine on the box, mind you. Really digging in that Wolverine/Logan rivalry in this movie Apperantly they had one more scene where Deadpool kills baby hitler but it got scrapped One big text just telling you to appreciate the people who worked on the film. Honestly, I kinda like it. Can't wait for that Vanisher solo movie! I like that when he went back he only saved regular Dave and none of the others. R I P The choir singing ""holy shitballs"" had me rolling! I’m a little surprised they didn’t reference that line or at least the bit in X-Men 3. [deleted] He was the perfect surprise character to throw in.  A fan favorite, and like Deadpool and Wolverine he's a perfect fit for an R-rated universe, in many ways more so than a normal X-Men movie.  Also, I like how they made him actually gigantic the way they did, instead of just a buff guy in a big helmet like he was in X3. Dude I wanted that line so bad.  I was so disappointed he never said it.    It's like the opposite of a muppet... Did we really see a kids penis or am I crazy  The ""I'm Batman"" line was received with a big laugh in my theater, everyone loved that one. When he got up to shake his hand all I could think of was “Baby Legs Cop” from Rick and Morty Just shirtcockin' it *Bye, Wade!*       

this joke should NOT be as funny as it is but makes me crack everytime. I love how Ryan mimics the anime gestures so well  Kawaii as fuck. Cute Mutants doing Cute Things 

E:[Apparently they are first openly gay superhero couple on-screen](http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/deadpool/feature/a857063/deadpool-2-lgbtq-couple-teenage-negasonic-warhead-yukio/)

 She was fucking adorable and I loved how she was always nice to Wade not seeming aware how much Negasonic hated him. Literally Wade to Yukio (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ And a pretty cool reference to the music video too.  When was the cover? Because if you're referring to the slow version near the end, I'm pretty sure that was the Mtv unplugged version but still Aha performing. The fact that Vanisher was Brad Pitt, appearing only for half a second. :p Tj giving Cable the warning about it too.  The fact that the wind advisory just seemed like a small joke to use twice, and then it ended up is awful foreshadowing was just so perfect. Definitely my favorite part of the movie as well. I was lowkey angry because I really liked Zeitgeist from his introduction already, and coming off 2017's IT, I was really interested with seeing Bill Skarsgard do a Marvel character. Didn't expect him to seem like such a punk-stylish character too, which was great. Then...well. And I also really wanted to see Shatterstar on the big screen. So much for that. Their deaths earned some well deserved laughter from our audience though, probably the loudest ones in the movie, along with ''what the fuck!''s all around. 

I guess Shatterstar did get his turn on the big screen. You might say he is, in fact, splattered all over it. The green blood was a nice touch. If anyone asks me about the movie I'm going to hype up Terry Crews' role saying Bedlam and the others are the best part of the movie. Yep.  He’s definitely awake. That ☓-force scene was one of the biggest turns not spoiled I can remember!  Yeah I was surprised there weren’t any leaked rumors about juggernaut from what I saw. 

Plus I’m glad they saved the Vanisher joke for the movie instead of wasting it in the trailer.  He just wanted one last piece of human contact with someone, *anyone*, before rolling into the collision to hopefully *commit suicide*. 

Wasn’t just heavy. It was dark af.  I thought he just hugged him to hold onto him as he went into the truck to make sure he killed him.  Killed a few people. I was actually expecting some sort of ""WTF?"" reaction from Wolverine after that since I thought they taped another secret cameo from Hugh Jackman (I mean why not?  They got Pitt to do a quick one for Vanisher).  Would've been another layer of glorious. ""Welcome to the big leagues""

#GETS SHOT. That was probably the best after credits scene I've ever seen. I can't think of anything else better imo. [deleted] ... Holy shit. That fight started with Juggernaut threatening to shove cable up Deadpool's butt. That's so amazing Did anyone else see juggernaut getting out of the water while the xforce walked away? The fact they made beast up in full makeup is just so awesome. Literally for a 5 sec cameo People are speeding past that to post credits stuff . It was of my favorite cameo of the movie .  The look on their faces was God damn priceless.  Matt Damon with the triple play surprise cameo between Ragnarok, Unsane, and now this Oh. My. God.

I was wondering why I recognized Tudyk but had no idea who the other guy was when it seemed like a prime spot for a cameo. You have good eyes, sir. Cutest shit ever!  Bye Wade 👋

Bye Yukio 🤲👐✌️✌️ [removed] I cracked there and fell totally left out coz no one in my theatre got it  Cinematography by Blind Al. He basically acted like Ricky Baker with mutant powers and it was awesome!  Love that he got a 2pac reference in too.   Shit. Just. Got. Real. Damn it feels good to be a gangster  No child left behind. No child left behind. god what a great movie. hunt for the wilderpeople is an underrated movie  > I feel like Deadpool messing with the timeline could explain all the other inconsistencies in the X-Men Franchise.

Between that and Wolverine's comment in *Logan* about how the comics are mostly bullshit/propaganda, I'd say they've done enough hand-waving for us not to get hung up on the (admittedly convoluted) timelines. I'm really glad Vanessa is still alive. I was a bit miffed that they decided to kill her at the start to further Deadpool's character. But by the end credits I'm down with it. She's back and Deadpool got some character development! The X-Force costume solidified the idea that the lineup at the end is gonna be the one for the X-Force movie   Sun's getting real low big guy I count six.
Hawkeye.
Black Black Widow.
Winter Soldier arm.
Thanos.
Sun's getting real low.
Brown Panther.

Any I missed? That line got a big belly laugh from me. Great line. > I’m glad Cable was able to grow as a character

just a shame he was so damn short.  Deadpool dropping MLK on him was hilarious in his sincerity. 

It was like Deadpool really cared about Cable’s imaginary intolerance.  While we are on Vanessa ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 

I reckon Vanessa's appearance was a fine interpretation of the Death romance, since Death's interaction is fairly limited to Thanos and DP, and I think audiences will accept a romance with Vanessa's appearance better than a skeleton.

My own personal crazy fan theory: when ppl die, they all become a part of Death, so **Technically** Vanessa is death. (""One is all; all is one"" concept.) Everyone was so excited to see Terry Crews in this. Lmao. Never fuck with the strong winds dammit!... at least Domino made it  Peter is okay though. We can all look forward to his future adventures on the X-force!  Hey, Terry, you're in Deadpool 2!

...

For about 2 minutes. [removed] Best laugh for me was "" we're the X-men a thinly veiled analogy for race relations in the 60s"" then tries to fist bump a black guy. No love for fixing the timelines? That there was a real out of the left field hit. I just wish Cable would start judging people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.

""Cable is racist"" was absolutely hilarious That Jared kushner joke killed me Agreed. Domino's luck power was great. Loved every scene it came into play, but it clearly didn't make her overpowered. She was also a fun character as well. Hope to see her in X-Force. Zazie was phenomenal as Domino! I absolutely loved her carefree attitude, even if it's different from her comic persona. This iteration of Domino is perfect for Ryan's Deadpool. Can't wait to see more. “I don’t know... 7?”

“There’s no way it’s that simple.”

*beep*

“Well that’s just lazy writing.” Her fight scenes were honestly the most brutal. It's like somebody weaponised Death from the Final Destination movies. Beetz is 😍😍 She’s so attractive too. I couldn’t stop staring at her jaw The song during the credits played during the Collosus v Juggernaut fight as well. [deleted] I fucking laughed my ass off, it's hilarious he pokes fun at himself like that.  “Who are you?”

“...I’M BATMAN” The surprise of it being Brad Pitt just added to the hilarity.  Personally I'm just glad StarShatter got what was coming to him. He was kind of a dick. It was a great opportunity for surprise Matt Damon to strike once more, but it being Pitt was hilarious too The x-force death but was outstanding they had built up in the trailers such a story for them to finish them they all die immediately? Fucking classic >imagine how awesome seeing the Hulk would have been in Thor: Ragnarok if you didn't know he was in it?

This is why I never watch trailers. I did experience this, and it was awesome. I love that Wade loved Yuki.  Looked homemade. Know what ya gotta do.  According to the interviews she is. They know it’s lazy writing but they don’t care  Yes. Given DP's penchant for meta stuff, anything in the post-credits is canon. And yes, that includes the timeline jumps to X-Men: Origins and another parallel timeline similar to ours where Ryan Reynolds played Green Lantern.  The comic’s explanation is she’s telekinetic and she’s using those powers to subconsciously manipulate he’s surroundings in her favor.  That actually sounds about right for Deadpool. But surely her side would have lost in the end right, or one of her teammates at the orphanage would have died? Some of the orphans she was rescuing would have suffered some kind of accident being in her vicinity. 

 Full Winnie the Poohing it! Right!? We **never** would have got a fight between Colossus and The Juggernaut like that in a regular X-Men movie. That was so intense, I loved every minute of it. And they made him huge! 

I'm hoping Colossus ends up as a staple of the movie version of X-Force. I kind of love the idea of him being a good influence on Wade while Wade is a bad influence on him. They pair really well together.  The Deadpool movies feel like they take place alongside a series of X-Men movies that doesn't really exist. Like the orphanage in this one should clearly tie into a movie where they fight Mr. Sinister, or we should've seen the team take on the Juggernaut beforehand. 

Honestly when/if the X-Men get absorbed into the MCU they should work backwards from Deadpool and keep this version of Colossus (and NTW and Surge of course).  Black ""Black Widow"" I was straight up crying! Sniffles and everything! 

I've never been so sad about someone surviving. :/

 #wadenessa4ever It was just so well executed. I loved that once he was past the veil he returned to his Pre-Avacado state. I was hoping for a little more Vanessa in this movie, but the moments we did get were excellent.  Their chemistry is undeniable. Doesn't hurt that they are 2 very attractive human beings making out.  Deadpool killed Ryan Reynolds*  Also calls him One-Eyed Willy, a reference to his being in Goonies. *Dubstep is for pussies* When he takes Wade’s arcade token and says “something to remember you by.”

I instantly heard Thanos saying “I hope they remember you.” Have you watched the show on FX called Atlanta?  She has such a fantastic smile. I was worried going in that the character wouldn't be portrayed right but i loved everything about it she was my favourite character in this movie. She's so cool, laid back, 😌 Well see I was gonna form a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. We were gonna get on that plane there and do some bad guy stuff but no one showed up. Not enough pamphlets.  I thought it was Jermaine Clement, but it apparently isn’t. Either one would have been perfect You know a movie has comedic gold when even a line of it makes you laugh and revisit the scene in your mind's eye. I like how now two Marvel films have ripped on how cheesy that whole thing was. Don’t forget the George W one.  So, Ryan Reynolds? Confirmed in the credits

I'm hoping we see behind the scenes footage of the actual Brad Pitt in a green screen suit wearing a parachute.  [deleted] That Celine Dion song is so good YOU KILLED BLACK TOM AND HE WAS LIKE A BROTHER TO ME!!!! Dubstep just won’t die...

**Bangerang plays again** Plus my favourite joke of the movie with the dig at Rob Liefield's feet.  I mean... he's right, right? The younger cast was probably cheaper to get tbh I thought it was going to be that the oil drum explosion separated his heart from his body and that it literally wasn’t in the right place. The flash to Vanisher and his backpack lmao  Yeah, I saw the double feature. The second one rolls right off the first one. Fantastically done. Like he didn't even sound angry or excited to do it. He just wanted to let Deadpool know what was going to happen How are you gonna bring up that insane Juggernaut fight without mentioning he was defeated because they shoved an electric cable into his butt hole? Dubstep is for pussies One of the many reasons I'm glad I re-watched the original right beforehand. Likewise with Brad Pitt as the Vanisher. Blink and you miss it. Don’t feel bad, no one really remembers Marco Beltrami’s scores anyways. [deleted] ""He's right behind you, isn't he"" might have been my favourite line ""Because you unleashed the Juggernaut you _cunt_"" While the likes of Chris Evans and Michael B Jordan are only batting .500  > https://www.instagram.com/p/Bhz9R47hPk8/?hl=en&taken-by=joshbrolin
 
I love how the seat is down and everything hahahaha
 There was actually a painting of Karl Marx up in the X-Mansion too. And he actually fucking did it. That made every gross thing he said he would do in every scene after sound *real.* The credits listed it as:

- The Juggernaut - as himself

Which I thought that was funny Yeah same I couldn’t tell who was in the room it happened so fast [Still of that](https://i.imgur.com/4HTQL8z.jpg) And a John Wick reference in the opening credits as well.  The suggestive poses were the best. Cinematography by: Blind Al TIL Xavier’s dick still works  Bluray extra!
 And how many jobs it created too! He would have been unstoppable if he used his momentum. I would have loved to see it, but if he gained momentum there would have been no way to stop him that would have felt ""real"". I like the big-boy-brawl between him and Colossus, that was a decent way to handle it.  ""I'm gonna melt you down into a cockring"" Speaking of muppets, did every theater see that Happytime Murders trailer? I kept thinking I was being punk'd by DP through the whole trailer, but I guess it's a real thing We definitely did. That took me entirely by surprise. I was not expecting to see baby dick on the big screen when I entered the theatre.  full winnie the pooh I think it's because it was almost the same interaction no matter the scenario. ""Hi yukio!"" ""Hi Wade!"" It's because the friendliness aggravates a very serious mutant with a very silly name that a child might pick for themselves. Well he does secretly post on /r/ddlc/ Bye Wade!!  The real question is what will happen to Yukio if she pressures Negasonic into prom sex? Will Wade have pity on her?  I just got that. Damn that's good Link for reference.

 They also reference Interview with the Vampire, like, 3/4 times before his cameo, which makes it even better But it was enough to get him listed in the credits Peter too! On the plane

""Is anyone worried about this wind advisory?"" I only gave him everything he wanted ""Pssst, big time foreshadowing moment."" I just love how many videos were posted speculating about the future of X-Force, and everyone gets wiped out. Perfect.  They had actual scenes in the trailer that never were I'm the movie. Was really good to be surprised. Probably because he is entirely CGI. There won't be leaked set photos and the likes haha I think with what Deadpool went through in the first movie he knew the truck collision wouldn't kill him. Are we sure that moment wasn't from a DC movie? It was both. He needed a hug, and he wanted to kill the guy, and he wanted to kill himself.  I might be wrong but it seemed like they just CGI'd Pitt's face into that scene  ""You're welcome Canada. ""

😂 Can I hust say... Green Leantern wasnt Ryan's fault at all. I loved him as Hal. And Mark Strong was incredible as Sinestro. The film just sucked. apparently the original screening shown Deadpool killing baby Hitler, but it got cut from the theatrical relase. I hope the scene gets added as a bonus when it comes out on blue\-ray, all the more reason to buy it. Pretty sure it was the other way around  Another subtle joke is that the beginning of the film is Deadpool being upset that Logan dies in his film and stole his rated R, Deadpool dies in this film and even in his dying moments they played the music Logan died to.  I loved that threat from Juggernaut too, especially when Deadpool yelled ""I BELIEVE HIM"" after.  I mean, after the scene of him ripping Deadpool in half, I definitely believed him too. They were filming Dark Phoenix though, so it probably wasn't just for this scene I assume that he's a super nerd since his best friend, Ben Affleck, is a super nerd, and to me this seems like the best way to do the super hero movies: cameo in all of them so you get to experience the magic but don't have to stress if you're doing one of your favorite characters justice. I said to a guy at work yesterday he basically ran away from Sam Neill and discovered super powers. ""Ca-Caw!"" Yes! I don't think many people understood that reference. Right after he called Cable Thanos too

black ""black widow"" was also choice  6 MCU references for 6 OG Avengers... perfectly balanced as all things should be  What was the Hawkeye reference? I couldn't quite catch it, just heard him saying Hawkeye. X-Force jumping out of the plane with AC/DC playing was a reference to Iron Man 2's opening Not really the same but there was a Rob Liefield feet joke that I can't quite remember the context of. In the comics I think he was listed as 6'8 or something and like 450 lbs with all the metal.

Like, ridiculous haha. I thought we were getting Lady Death at first. I liked the way they did it though. Thanos (ok, ok, a man who was also Thanos) just denied Deadpool his time with Death.  I thought the mid-credit scene cancelled out her death. Maybe people just look at it as a joke but I dunno it seems like an awfully Deadpool thing to do for me. I like the idea of her being Lady Death, cause she plays a big part in the comics for Deadpool. Even though Vanessa, in the comics, is Copycat isn't she? Or is that a different Vanessa? But I think she'd be more important to the story as Lady Death than Copycat.  He was in a lot of the marketing material/interview junket too ha Everyone freaked out at brad pitt I was excited to see Brad Pitt as 'The Vanisher' Psssh, she was just lucky It makes me wonder if the ""fixed"" timeline will be what goes into the next movie or not. I hope so. [removed] I think he says ""dated metaphor"" instead of ""thinly veiled analogy"". [deleted] Oddly reminded me of the scene from the office where Michael yells to a dying Stanley “STANLEY BARACK IS PRESIDENT. YOU ARE BLACK STANLEY”  Hands down best marvel post credits scene ever They did a great job displaying her power on screen. I absolutely adore Neena in the comics, and essentially this was Domino in name and powers only. But I'll be damned if Zazie didn't own the role and make me love her too.  [deleted] Why did he say that though? The ""I'm Batman"" scene got one of the biggest laughs in my theater. I don't know how the hell this movie got made, everyone was probably laughing the entire time.  ""Your so dark, you sure you're not from the DC universe?"" Weirdly, I felt like the only one in the theater that really wigged out at that reveal. Maybe it was too fast, or everyone was just caught up in the hilarity of everything else. A friend I went to see it with is a huge Shatterstar fan and I looked over to him when it happened and he just look destroyed. Pureed like a vat of split pea soup by whirling helicopter blades, that's how I want to go! You know those hicks near the start drinking in the back of the truck? One of them was Matt Damon :P And all the actors were on the press tour like they were significant parts of the movie. Hell, Lewis Tan did a fucking AMA What do you do when you're in a theater basically being forced to watch trailers?  And honestly, it's for the best.  She is a great actor, and her presence really grounds Deadpool.  I feel like without their love, the movie is just violence and jokes. I'm actually glad for the retcon. It really soured me during the first act when they had to rely on killing Vanessa off just to develop Deadpool's character. But the quick bonus scene bringing her back honestly made me so happy. Sounds like something someone who cant draw feet would come up with I mean half those pedophiles died in pretty gruesomely unlucky ways. The team it set up at the end is just perfect. That's X Force.  Well juggernaut climbed out of the pool in the background so he's probably available as a villain in DP3 Big CGI fight coming right up! Juggernaut ripping Deadpool in half is the closest I'll ever get to a live action ripping of Wolverine in half by Hulk, so I appreciated the hell out of that. Yeah between the post-credit scene of Logan and the orphanage being named Essex and this being the introduction of Cable, I for sure thought they’d at least introduce Mr. Sinister or something. 

But now we have Cyclops, Jean Grey, Cable, and Hope (I’m assuming Summers) all in play so now would be the perfect time to introduce the man who is obsessed with them and their Bloodlines. 

 I got the reference but totally forgot Brolin was the older bro in that. Wow. I'm also 90% sure the Hawaiian shirt Deadpool wears in the tiny leg basic instinct scene is the same as Chunk's from The Goonies.  lando is so hot ""I should've finished college..."" Jemaine. It's Jemaine. He's said it at least 25 times. It was Sala Baker. Kiwi stunt man. Probably best known as Sauron in Lord of the Rings. ""Misson accomplished, in a George W kinda way.""

I think I was one of the few who laughed at that. Mind you, I'm from Austria. I'm pretty sure he would love this joke. Deadpool 2 has a strong contender for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Holy shitballs.  Pump the hate breaks, Fox and Friends! And Deadpool 2 and the upcoming X-Men: Dark Pheonix were filming at the same time. Basically 'hey come over to the Deadpool set for a quick scene'. I was rolling seeing just the backpack jumping/falling out of the plane.  Holy shit that was Brad Pitt! Ahhhhhh I feel like I knew this, but I didn't have the time to process it. The only thing I was thinking was ""damn he's pretty hot for an invisible guy."" I wanted to see an interaction between him and Cyclops.  As dumb as this sounds I just got that lol Yeah, I saw that too. Considering it was Deadpool he was threatening to do it to, I figured it'd actually happen, but it was still hilarious how casually he just says it and then does it.  Definitely one of my favorite character introductions in a movie in recent memory. Beast is front and centre, closing the doors.  Quicksilver behind him to his right, wearing a Nirvana shirt.  Prof X on the bottom right.  On the left was Cyclops, Storm and Nightcrawler.  Fantastic cameo!  Is it Deadpool super sexualized and posing? He mindfucked them.  15,000!
 I loved that Colossus actually fought him well and wasn’t just a comedic punching bag like the first movie. He definitely had the upperhand for half of the fight.  He's crawling out the pond at the end too so I'm sure he'll be back.  I have never been more disturbed than I was at the end of that trailer. I honestly don’t know if I’ve ever been left with my jaw hanging at the end of a trailer like that. There was Kal'El's baby dick in Man of Steel \(Russel Crowe talked about this scene on Graham Norton's show, a great anecdote\), so it's allowed in PG\-13 too Ann Perkins!﻿ The goodbye version during his death scene was hilarious. (◕‿◕✿) the scene with wade and vanessa touching through a “looking glass” with wade being transformed–that felt like a visual reference to the take on me music video too, didn’t it?

...also dolly parton singing nine to five during a barbaric fight sequence worked better than, well better than...better than anything. You wouldn't NOT credit Brad Pitt. :p ""I WAS IN THE GOD DAMN SPECIAL FORCES, YOU THINK WE DIDN'T JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE BECAUSE OF A LIGHT BREEZE!""

^^^I'mOnlyYellingToImpressTheOtherGuysI'dNeverLetAnythingHappenToYouSugarBear More like Ex-Force am I right? I have type 1 and 2 diabetes Lots of it was just improv from other takes, which makes me actually want to buy this when it comes out digitally, just to watch all those extra takes that didn't make the final cut. In an interview with the director, he had Pitt for like 5 minutes.  I THINK the director was Pitt's stunt double in something else and they became friends... but reynolds' career suffered badly after. he struggled through b-movies and direct to tv movies in canada after the failure that is green lantern. it took him years to climb back up as an a-lister. Deadpool(2016) was gonna make or break his career. Exactly. And that's why Colossus says ""The way we do in mother russia"" Because it's a russian reversal. ""In mother russia cable goes up your ass"" Yeah he said he was going to shove the red one up the old ones ass. [deleted] It’s pretty funny on its own, but packs extra punch for the Wilderpeople fans  I liked ""Brown Panther."" /r/UnexpectedThanos Wade said that with the mutant collar all he needed was a bow and arrow and he’d be as useless as Hawkeye basically.  ‘That sounds like he was created by a guy who can’t draw feet.’ Shit he'd be as big as colossus I choose to look at it from a more obvious POV. He got Cable's time travel gizmo and is undoing all the stuff he wants changed. While most of it was funny, fourth-wall, fix the Fox fuck up stuff, I can see him reversing Vanessa's death as well for personal gain, because that's a Deadpool thing to do.

There doesn't seem to be a ""butterfly effect"" established here given Cable's ""my family is safe"" line even if he doesn't travel back to them. And turning Russell sees like a major event in the timeline. Seems more like a ""hey this is a goofy comic scenario that you should just accept for what it is, and not over analyze"" type of deal. Which I'm completely fine with because it's extremely entertaining and let's be honest, this is Deadpool. Poor Terry man lol.. they did him and the X-Force so dirty.  Bedlam and Shatterstar would've been really nice additions to the series.  I even feel bad for Lewis Tan since he was here a week ago doing an AMA! Honestly disappointed they didnt go with John Cena wait theres brad pitt?

edit:oh its the vanisher Seems like it would be hard to demonstrate on screen. [deleted] I was hoping Cable would continue to refer to him as Batman for the rest of the movie. Meanwhile in the DC universe “BEEBO HUNGRY” I didn't notice too, only saw some long hair blonde dude suddenly getting electrocuted. Only realized during the credits that it was Brad Pitt. TIL there is such a thing as a Shatterstar fan. And she's REALLY hot. [Rob Liefeld can't draw pectorals either.](https://imgur.com/otDKMmS) Agree completely. The X\-men \(women\) run off to help the kids as X\-Force walk off into the sunset. I can't believe they almost got me to cry to ""Take On Me""  It'll be really stupid but I would love if we saw it from their perspective in dark Phoenix. I knew when we saw the power lines that'd we'd see his face. 

 NEVER imagined it would be a freaking Brad Pitt lol  I noticed that one, but I totally missed that the Rednecks with the truck early on were Alan Turdyk and Matt Damon (as Dickie Greenleaf).  Oh yeah I forgot Cyclops is his dad lol ""All these pictures of old white men. I should have brought my rape whistle.""

Big laugh from my crowd. Was it just me or did Quicksilver’s hair look shorter? McAvoy or Stewart? That's why Juggernaut wears protection.  The difference is that’s just a baby in Man of Steel and Deadpool was being “sexy” because it was his Basic Instinct.  I thought that was going to be his actual ""power"" since you can't have both. Glad they swapped out some lines to keep some surprises. He was originally called on to play Cable as well. That movie is how he met his current wife. Just saying.  That is why Cable called Deadpool ""Buttplug"" a little later. It would be funny as hell, but I don't see it considering Dark Phoenix takes place in the 90s. But then again, timelines and shit. I liked X-force jumping out of the plane to AC/DC. Pretty sure it was an homage to Iron Man. [deleted] Ouch. That's brutal. Rob Liefield was always compensating for the small feet with size, pouches, big guns and double swords. >Poor Terry man lol.. 

Terry Crews is the type of person that I beat got a huge kick out the joke. I really loved what this movie did with Shatterstar. Best use of the character possible and they even threw a Liefeld can't draw joke in to ice the cake. They only showed Peter on-screen, but it’s possible that Deadpool was able to save the rest of the X-Force off-camera when he went back in time. That would have been amazing. And certainly cinematic. It also appears to have been filmed in Canada. Yeah I've never met another human who would describe their relationship with the character of Shatterstar as more than ""aware of"" [deleted] And gets hotter with age. Just out here living that Marisa Tomei lifestyle.  This is disgusting  T H I C C [deleted] The other one was Matt Damon? Holy shit It was probably filmed whilst they were filming Dark Phoenix so thats probably his 90s look in the movie  McAvoy according to the credits. Josh Brolin did awesome but I can see Pitt doing it well too these timelines are so confusing I was so excited by the prospect of seeing a team of ragtag superheroes just up and kick ass and then they all died.

Most of the movie I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry.  When Cable arrives and confronts Tucker ~~and Dale~~, *Escape* is playing on the radio. I took that as a Guardians of the Galaxy reference. It was even more brutal than that, he said “I’m useless. I’m a big lump of cancer. All I need is a bow and arrow and I’d be like Hawkeye” I almost miss the days where big comics got away with bad art like so brazenly like Liefield. 

almost. I need more Shatterstar, hopefully the trailer clips appear in the DVD 
...Also love that his alien Mojo blood was green Nah, pretty sure he just saved Paul because he was his favorite Thing is, she's only 39. I feel like she would be older because she's been around forever.  This is the peak male form, whether you like it or not. *Hi Yukio!!* Yeah. Matt is the guy delivering the speech on butt wiping. Weird considering this movie seemed to take place in 2018 or so, since they were talking about George Michaels being dead. Especially when in the trailer it shows shatterstar fighting swat guys Absolute unit.  ""Atleast we still have Bowie"" Deadpool 4th wall breaking. You could easy see it as the xen cast filming their next movie. The trailer faked us out y-yeah! at least we still have bowie.... ...more trailers need to do this. ",0
134,"I got a kick out of the Watergate ending because it felt like I was watching a post-credit scene teasing the next film in the American History Cinematic Universe I Fucking loved that Bob and David had their first scene in the movie together.  Anyone else love how they showed the typesetting machines near the end? I love that kind of stuff in movies. I love how they tried to make the movie feel super feminist, but when that lady started reading out the results of the trial, that dude just jumped in and shouted out the answer. Literally lol'd. It’s the most dramatic re-enactment if people carrying folders with papers in them.  Over and over again.  But it was great [deleted] Do you think the final scenes of the movie were to set up a Nixon Cinematic Universe? The sequel could be a remake of All the Presidents Men, and then maybe onto other major historical events of the 1970s. I love that OP snuck Meth Damon into the credits haha Great tweet from Tyler Simpson (@braintasm) -

“Went and saw The Post tonight. I watched a film about newspapers inside a movie theater inside of a mall. It was a dying industry turducken.” Don’t have time to post a thorough detailed analysis, but I absolutely loved the ending! The way they transitioned it to watergate was amazing. I enjoyed it. It has the hallmarks of Spielberg's late works. Especially the preening Americana of reading the Majority opinion of the SCOTUS to the newsroom aloud and Meryl Streep walking down the SCOTUS steps as a row of women look on. It's the kind of hokey bullshit Spielberg does when he's on auto pilot. It's an exclamation point where a period would have been better. 

The bulk of the movie, following all these people doing the reporting is quite exciting although I wish more time was dedicated to spending time with Daniel Ellsberg and some of the attempts to actually get the Pentagon papers out into the public record like Sen. Mike Gravel actually reading them on the senate floor. It's a tight movie but not expansive in the ways it could have been. 

It's still a good movie. I would recommend it. The performances all around are pretty stellar.  

I will say John Williams action material played over the end credits was quite good. Reminded me of his days working with Oliver Stone on Nixon Overall the film is pretty mid level Spielberg but goddamn can Spielberg block and shoot a scene. So many elegant walk and talks and great visual storytelling. I saw both the Commuter and The Post today. I was surprised to see more people at the screening for the Post than for the Commuter. It was mostly a bunch of old people that went to see the Post and surprisingly they were a fun crowd.  I actually didn't really know anything about this going into it. I knew it was Spielberg, Hanks and Streep. I knew it was about a newspaper fighting to publish. I thought it was going to be more court room drama, we got like 3 minutes in the courts, if that. 

But the cast was stacked. Phenomenally written and acted and I just all around loved it. Might watch it again to share with my family, but for the most part this was a one and done affair for me.

And I have to say I love Spielberg's love of history. I love how he'll do a big budget action flick and then one of these cool period true life period dramas.  The sequence of Streep making her decision was incredible. My audience actually clapped at the end of it.

My complaint is that in the first half the drama really seemed to halt whenever it went to Streep. 2nd half was engaging throughout, but it did drag a bit in the first half.

And not enough Carrie Coon or Michael Stuhlbarg, but obviously excellent performances across the board. I enjoyed the movie, but was surprised to be the only person under 50 in my theater.

The biggest surprise for me was **David Cross**. I'm a huge *Arrested Development* fan and was shocked at how good he was in a dramatic role.  If you liked Steve Jobs in the sense that it felt like all the action took form in the place of words, you should love this. I had a great time personally. (Edited Jobs to Steve Jobs. I mixed the two up) This film is ""important"" in the most shallow sense of the word. 

It only scratches the surface of the journalistic process. *All the President's Men* and *Spotlight* completely blow this film out of the water in that respect.

There were so many cringey moments that had me rolling my eyes. 

It's just okay. 6/10 [deleted] As a companion to *Lincoln* and *Bridge of Spies* this is disappointing. It’s a pretty shallow look at the meaning of the fourth estate as opposed to the nuanced depiction of political action in *Lincoln* or his analysis of a country’s morals in *Bridge of Spies.*

As a journalism movie, however, it kind of rocks. Given the way it was advertised I expected a somewhat sluggish period film. Instead I was decently entertained from the beginning and found myself surprised at how brisk it felt by the end. 

I feel like this is getting misidentified as a prestige film because it’s way more of a blockbuster in its verve (hell, Williams score sounds like a damn action film at times). It’s a film about the flow of information, and Spielberg kind of captures that invisible kineticism with his camera and blocking. There’s a lot of overhead shots of papers flying in and out of frame and people moving from location to location. This movie may **feel** relatively rote but the Beard does still have great technical skill and feeling. 

Also I know people hate it but the ending to this is so goofy I kind of love it.  The scene of Kay walking down the steps after the Supreme Court hearing into a crowd of hippie women had me rolling my eyes.  It’s almost as if Spielberg rolled out of bed and directed a movie with all his buddies (literally everyone and their mother is in this movie). This is about the most generic Spielberg drama you could possibly get. It’s fine, harmless, somewhat interesting, but ultimately forgettable. Meh.

This movie was meh.

Competent but on autopilot. Hanks and Streep were OK but not at their greatest, a lot of the supporting cast were wasted and the script was alarmingly unsubtle and shouldn't have been nominated for a Globe. The themes were pretty much spelled out on the most annoyingly on the nose way possible (like Sarah Paulson's shoehorned speech and that eye rolling court walk scene).

Oh and that ending was just ridiculously goofy and dragged out what could have been a nice ending.

It's not all bad - the score's great and some scenes of the journalism and printing were genuinely quite enthralling. But this is really just bogstandard Spielberg historical drama and is one of his weakest efforts. Certainly of the big awards contenders that I've seen so far this is comfortably the weakest one. I loved this movie, I live in Venezuela and used to work in a local tv station banned by the regime, it touched a nerve in me. I'm disappointed by some of the comments here, I guess you don't know what you have until you lose it. 

The right for free press must not be taken for granted. I really hated the part where Sarah Paulson spelled out Meryl Streep’s character arc to Tom Hanks. It’s exactly what I expected. Nothing surprised me, no one moment really stood out, but that’s okay sometimes. Sometimes a really solid, competent, well-acted film with a timely message is enough. 8/10 from me All I could think of during the ending scene was [this.](https://youtu.be/bmnSMlAstMc?t=36s) I really enjoyed this film, I personally had no issues with the slow pace.

Bob Odenkirk and Tom Hanks had really interesting roles, I think they both did an outstanding job.

Also I loved the scenes detailing The Post’s printing press in action, it was positively hypnotizing. 

Particularly the machine that pulls the papers up on a vertical conveyor belt, that contraption is just fascinating to watch. This movie was ultimately super disappointing. I think they focused on the wrong character.  Kay's transformation wasn't interesting enough to back the whole movie.  Her 'arch' actually took away from the more interesting parts of the story.  

I think the allstar cast actually also killed this movie.  I will never by Meryl Streep as an underdog.  Also it seems like they remembered that they hired Allison Brie and Sarah Paulson and decided to give both random monologues. 

Also, if they didn't want to be compared to All the President's Men, they shouldn't have ended the movie at watergate.  Let the characters have their victory and move on.  Opening with Watergate reminds a lot of movie fans of the beginning of All the President's Men, in which it pales in comparison.  So, who's agenda is being served by making 'The Post' look like the hero in all this rather than the Times? Legit question... I can't quite figure it out by looking up who owns both these papers (as it just gives me LLCs). This movie is like Rogue One to All The President’s Star Wars. Very awesome. I think it's a well-shot, well-acted, and fairly well-paced movie, that is interesting but overall somewhat forgettable and kinda heavy-handed in certain regards. The female empowerment bits were ok, but they didn't seem like a focus of the movie, and we're just kind of tacked on and final scene of her walking out of the courthouse through the dozens of women was a little forced. The focus seemed much more on the separation of the press and the politicians, but then that started to feel a bit overdone by the end. Overall, I think it was a good movie with an obvious message for today's political climate. Someone get Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks an ice pack, because their hands are sore after patting each other on the back so much. Meth Damon and Gabe were cast perfectly in this movie.

Also, when did it become a law that every Vietnam-era film has to open with CCR?  I'm loving the Nixon era extended universe! The Post, Forrest Gump, All the President's Men, and Frost Nixon. I didn't care for this movie and it honestly should have been a slam dunk for someone like me. I like all the actors, I'm a Spielberg fan, and I like the subject matter. I am having a difficult time remembering a movie that was edited worse than this one that was supposed to be high-caliber. There were countless times that i thought ""why are we watching this scene?"" ""Why did he pick THAT camera angle? It seems weird for this scene."" ""I need to look away because the text is moving by the screen so quickly it's making me nauseous trying to read it."" (Why show us newspaper headlines if you don't give us any time to read them?) There were also several ""emotional"" scenes that felt tacked-on and unearned. I was totally unmoved by Streep and Alison Brie's conversation in the bedroom about the husband's suicide; and then unmoved again at the climax where Carrie Coon announces the SCOTUS decision. Coon's character is barely touched on and hardly has any dialogue. Plus, given the message of the movie (that women were often excluded and looked down on in the workplace), it struck me as bizarre that the male characters who are more senior than her would have allowed her to read it or that anyone would have contacted her first. I thought during this scene, ""I am supposed to be moved by this. This is where Spielberg wants me to cry."" Also, I actually laughed out loud in the closing scene where it turns out to be...WATERGATE!!! That reminded me of a superhero franchise movie, where the closing scene is actually a ""cliffhanger"" to get you interested in the upcoming sequel (The Post 2: Watergate Boogaloo), which was tonally bizarre for a straight Prestige Drama.

In short, I felt like i saw the first draft of this movie and would have liked to have seen what they would have come up with had they spent more time editing it.

Another critique: I feel like I am (early 30s) at the younger end of people who know this story and the people involved well enough to understand who most of the people were. However, I think Spielberg makes a LOT of assumptions that the audience already knows who all the people are that will be alienating to younger people. For example, he doesn't name Robert McNamara until several scenes in, assuming you must know that the Secretary of State at the time was him. Older people will have no problem, but even though I'm familiar enough with the story, I had to think to myself, ""Hmm. I THINK that's Bob McNamara, but I'll wait and see."" Spielberg is casting himself well as the Director Who Makes Movies Your Dad Likes But You Think Are Just OK. Generational directorial assumptions like this one further solidify that reputation.

The biggest asset of this movie was Meryl Streep (surprise, surprise). Even with lousy editing, the audience still knew exactly what Kay's motivations were, why she made the choices she did, and what her conflicts were. That's actually really remarkable in a movie as poorly edited as this one. Honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed. The actual history behind this is a story well worth telling (and has a certain resonance today), but as a film this was surprisingly on the dull side, particularly for the first third or so. I was hoping Ellsberg would be a major player, he's the one that leaked the damned papers in the first place, but nope. Kay, while I appreciate what her arc was in the grand scheme of things, wasn't that compelling of a character in her own right. I get that with films based on a true story there's a balance that has to be made between creating interesting characters and staying true to how they were in real life, but I feel like there are based-on-a-true-story films that handle that much better. Also, I really couldn't help but only see Hanks and Streep as Hanks and Streep.

This film was okay. I certainly wouldn't say it was *badly* done, but I feel that there is a better film that could be made out of this crazy, tumultuous time in American history. Go watch the recent Ken Burns documentary on the Vietnam War. I know that was a documentary and had the advantage of being a multi-episode TV series, but *that* was really well done and made me feel like I was living through that time in a way that this film just didn't quite do. Did anyone realise The Post was a mini reunion of many many Fargo characters? LOVE IT!  Went and saw this Thursday night with a rapturous crowd. This audience clapped a half-dozen times throughout as if this was opening night of Star Wars. I enjoyed the reception, but upon a revisit in a few years (probably after this administration), I’m not sure it’ll hold up. Let’s just say this movie convinced me to finally stop my incognito shenanigans: I subscribed to the Washington Post as soon as I got home.  The best scene here was by far Meth Damon trying to talk to Bob Odenkirk about his source.  Bob has developed a way of mastering somber expressions for closeups, and it’s no exception here.  Otherwise I dont think the film was as visually compelling as people seem to think, and the lead performances from Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep were pretty cookie-cutter bad and overshadowed by the phenomenal supporting cast.  Overall this was a very well directed, well written film that I would be completely happy watching again, though it eschews any artistic statements in favor of political ones. I was disappointed. It felt like Spielberg was just making tropes to get award noms. Loved seeing Bob Odenkirk and David Cross back together, but that's about it. Better than it should have been given how on the nose some of the script is.

The camera kept zooming in on faces right before they were about to give a big speech. That was a good trick but it must have happened at least 5 times. I saw this yesterday with some friends. It was good, def worth checking out, but basically inoffensive. The appeal of the film is watching Streep and Hanks. The material itself is so dry, trying to build an entire movie around it (Will she or won't she approve the paper to leak the papers)... it's not that compelling enough...  Absolutely loved it. Every performance was great. Lol, judging by the comments here I'm thinking the old ""Lady Bird wasn't well directed because NO SFX!"" rubbish has happened again with this movie. The scene with the secretary tearing up after delivering the speech from the guy on the phone was the cheesiest and corniest shit I've seen in years.

Also, I really hate how Spielberg chooses to have like 50 scenes end after someone says ""we need to look at this"" ""there's a problem"" ""look in the box then cut to next scene"". It feels like a very outdated directing technique.  The Post is the Rogue One of All the President's Men.  Had to look up Liz Hannah.  This is her first screenplay.  It’s her spec script that got picked up by Spielberg.   That’s amazing.   Just saw it, was predictably underwhelmed.  I wish Spielberg would take his time rather than cranking out movie after movie, this one just felt completely thrown together, with the best of the best to make up for the fact: Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, famous side characters (Bob Odenkirk and David Cross...why?).

Mainly though, I thought it was fascinating how this was essentially the same movie as *Spotlight* - same plot, same conflict: corrupt super power is covering up a scandal, intrepid journalists uncover the story and fight for it to go to press.  Only everything works in *Spotlight*, only some of the stuff works in *The Post* - which sucks, given that the topic is still pretty interesting in and of itself.  

There's also more twists and turns in *Spotlight*, we watch them uncover the story bit by bit - in *The Post* the story is set from the opening 30 minutes, all there is to do is to decide whether to publish or not...so we get scene after scene of handwringing and people talking about the pros and cons of going to print...which is frustrating, because it's slow, you know they're going to, and then the consequences barely seem to happen.  What should be the third act (the government's response) is condensed into a footnote.

I don't know, this movie felt like wasted potential. When Kay said “I can never live through something like this again” half the audience in my theater went “oooof”  Two great films about the Post, as someone who grew up and still lives in the DMV and grew up on the Post it’s nice to see.  While it wasn’t as good as All the President’s Men, but it was still a quality film.  It’s sad that the media is so consolidated now that you no longer get the feeling that they are fighting for the governed over their corporate interests.  Hopefully the press can become independent and prominent again.  I know given our current climate it’s hard to fight the good fight, when the Government and half the nation attack it constantly. It's amazing how relevant this these days.  It's just amazing...

A great film, Spielberg at his finest.  A really good story teller.  

Huge fan of this film.  I'm going to see it again tomorrow night. Wow seeing far negative reactions than I expected for this. I thought the movie was fantastic and the performances were strong (as expected) and carry the film throughout without making it boring. [deleted] Average at best.

Maybe I missed something, but the movie was filled with manufactured tension, varying characters with slightly above averages at best, and a sagging plot that fizzled to an inevitable conclusion. I felt like this movie was okay. For a movie that was directed by Spielberg, and had pretty superb acting from Streep (and Hanks), it still felt a little lackluster. Like a more generic Spotlight I guess. Still a solid 3.5 to 4, just didn't meet my expectations.  Kinda disappointed that Bob and David didn't interact. I thought this was really good. It was interesting to see the parallels between Nixon and Trump in regards to their views of the media.  Definitely a little “heavy handed” at times, but overall an enjoyable film.  I feel like the movie would have been better if the ended just after the 6-3 verdict was announced, but before the quote was relayed over the phone.  As it is, I felt like it was good for the first 75% then turned the ham up for the last quarter just in case someone in the theater didn't get the message. huge Spielberg fan, and i'm a huge sucker for these types of movies, but this was a by-the-numbers snoozer.  seemed like he did it just to check a box.  Spotlight did it way better.  Streep was the only light in the blandness, for me.  everyone else just looked like they were trying too hard to keep up with her.

no one will remember this film a year from now, and i suspect most people have already forgotten most of it.  heck i watched it a few hours ago and it's already a fuzzy blur.  no shining moments to latch onto.  shame. Just got back from the theater. I wasn't particularly excited for this movie, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. It was so well shot, and I loved Tom Hanks' and Bob Odenkirk's characters.

The story was also very engaging for me. One of the rare movies where I didn't even think about checking my watch. 

I also really enjoyed the last 20 minutes; especially when [Bradlee slaps all the other papers onto Graham's desk](#spoiler), that was a really great moment. 

It wasn't Spielberg's most memorable work, but I enjoyed the film, and I'm glad I saw it.

P.S. Really glad Carrie Coon got such a significant role. I've loved her since The Leftovers.  Meth Damon ?! I went into this without having seen any advertisements- just knew it was a new Spielberg/Tom Hanks film.

When the opening scene was a war scene in vietnam- I got really excited thinking it was gonna be another Saving Private Ryan.

I realized very soon after my hopes were ignorant at best, but I really enjoyed the film. Creating tension/suspense through talking only is very difficult to do, and I think they nailed it. Not a perfect film- some parts dragged or felt unnecessary, but overall it was a very well made film. The last scene made me more excited than the majority of the actual film (though I actually did enjoy it, despite its pace). 

Maybe too many Marvel films has warped my mind, but was Spielberg setting up the sequel in the last few minutes? I just came from seeing this and I just wanted to say how mad I am about the Nixon miming nonsense. I don't think the actor playing him was listening to the tapes when they filmed, they just told him to wag his finger around and bang his fist on the table once or twice completely out of time with what's actually being said. Drove me nuts. The second half was definitely more engaging than the first - it's kind of a shame that they breezed through that portion so quickly and that it took so long for the movie for them to get The Papers. Overall, it was fine - definitely not a bad movie, but not a great one either and not something that almost anyone would want to watch multiple times.

The way it ended to tie into Watergate was kind of an odd choice - felt more like an ending that someone would do if they were planning on hyping people up for a sequel, except that All The President's Men already exists - and that movie, along with a number of other journalism-related movies are vastly better than this. You could definitely tell that it was rushed into production, but it kind of speaks to the talent involved that they were still able to put forth something as well made as it was.

Definitely going to be one of those movies that is going to be played (and bore) countless numbers of American high schools in the many years to come. As far as Best Picture contenders go, I was really disappointed in both **The Shape Of Water** & **The Post**. At least **The Shape Of Water** felt fresh & original. On the other hand, I didn't get that from **The Post**.

Everything felt just 'okay'. Run-of-the-mill drama, low-tier Spielberg, with a bloated cast. The 'turning around and facing the camera while crying/delivering a monologue' parts felt incredibly fake & theater-y. Almost laughable sometimes. Really took me out of it, especially the over-acted scene between Streep & Brie. The opening Vietnam War scene looked cheesy and amateur. It's what I imagine a Vietnam War scene in a sitcom would look like.

I really didn't like Streep's character arc. How did she change that much within the span of 48 hours? Wasn't believable, on top of her character not being like-able for the majority of the film.

At least 3 times, I had the thought ""damn, I'd really rather be watching **All The President's Men** or **Spotlight** right now"". Just bland, uninspired. Such a dropoff from **Bridge Of Spies** for Spielberg.

I was really hyped for the cast but most of them are just throwaway characters with minimal screentime. The only decent supporting performances are from Bruce Greenwood & Bob Odendirk. Michael Stuhlbarg is criminally underused and David Cross seems so out of place.

6/10, okay I guess. Not Top 40 for me this year. The only true highlights for me are Tom Hanks/Tracy Letts and the shoe-in Watergate scene at the end. It was an easy/obvious scene to add, but I fucking loved it.
 Definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year. The acting was phenomenal. The story line was captivating ""News is the draft version of history"" Just had a laugh over Meth Damon. Thoroughly enjoyed it, but no, it's not perfect. It was a pretty by-the-numbers screenplay, but I think Spielberg did his best with what he was given. And there were actually a lot of pretty riveting scenes powered by dialogue. Yes, there are some scenes with the classic Spielberg heavy handedness, but that's kind of to be expected of him. But I can understand how that's off putting to some. From a technical standpoint though, the movie was top notch. I always love watching scenes unflod, and realizing that minutes have gone by without an edit and I've just been watching two actors do amazing work. Spielberg is truly a master behind the camera. Don't really understand a lot of the hate the movie is getting. Overall it's a pretty middle of the road movie for Spielberg, but that in no way means that it's a bad movie, it's just not OMG amazing. I actually don't think he has made a really great film since Munich. But anyway, the audience I saw it with seemed to be pretty enthralled and applauded at the end. I think the real goal of this movie was to get people thinking and talking, and it certainly had that effect on the audience I witnessed. Can we talk about the year Michael Stuhlbarg had? He had a pretty small role in this movie but he we fantastic in Call Me by Your Name and Shape of Water, especially Call. That's 3 huge movies/award contenders in a span of a few months. Not much else new to say - I liked it but think All The President's Men is a better overall film (and maybe more compelling subject matter), but I like the connection between the two. 

Loved the shots of the newspaper getting printed and how they created the typeset for the letterpress, etc. 

Most of the people in my theater cheered when Kay said, ""I'm talking to Ben"" after Arthur interrupted and disrespected her for the umpteenth time in the movie. For me, it was one of the most powerful moments of a great, feminist movie.  I mean it was good, but I wouldn’t consider this to be in the conversation of best picture. This was total Oscar bait and the academy fell for it. 

This was an okay Spielberg film. I’d rank it towards the middle of his filmography. I’m a pretty big history buff and was pretty excited to see this, but left kinda disappointed.

The ending scene with Watergate that basically leads into All The Presidents Men was great though.

70/100 I have read several comments about how the ending was odd, or felt a bit too on the nose or heavy handed. On the flip side, I really liked the ending. I was thinking how well timed it was (obviously intentionally) with whats going on, and how history is doomed to repeat itself if we aren't careful and learning from it. It went from one scandal to the next - kind of like: we got through this, it took all this courage, and then BAM, we got hit with another. Only luckily (for us as viewers) we have hindsight, and know how that ended. I am not at all political - but it definitely had me considering the current state of politics, the agenda of he who sits in the white house, and how the phone conversations of Nixon (where one man truly thought he was the state, and not serving the state) are just too similar for comfort from the banning of certain media outlets from press-breifings. 

Overall, I thought this movie was a solid 7 or 8. Certainly not the best 2017 had to offer (for me, that was Blade Runner or Molly's Game) but I enjoyed it. Saw it yesterday, it was certainly watchable but I left feeling a little underwhelmed. It was relying really hard on Hanks and Streep, yet Streep's character was so basic that I never was blown away. The whole movie just felt 'safe' and I never felt that same level of interest or investment as I did in say, Spotlight.

Weird movie, I would tell people its decent but to not expect anything great. The movie kinda just...happens.   I left feeling ""meh"" about this movie.

The last 45 minutes or so were great, but it really dragged until then. And I'm someone who likes a slow burn of a drama... but to me I never felt like anyone had stakes. I know she did because it was her family paper but I didn't feel like there was a larger backstory of why she cared about the paper other than owning it, why she cared about the truth, etc. We know her [son went to war](#spoiler) but it barely registered as a one line throwaway.

I don't know. I also felt like, especially for a Spielberg film, it was painful how poorly done the sets were. You could tell so clearly they were on a studio lot in the streets of New York. The protest scene was so fake it hurt. I don't know, the sanitized nature of everything took my out of the viewing.

But the last part was good. I don't know, I feel like they could have cut 25 minutes out and i would have liked it but I'm only glad I saw it since it's nominated for the Oscar's Were the Nixon tapes played throughout the movie the actual tapes or recreations of them? If they were recreations, who voiced Nixon? My favorite part of seeing this was when my mom (a geeky liberal journalist who misses newspapers the way most people miss their dead grandparents and used to do professional-level editing on my middle school book reports) turned to me during the scene where the reporters sift through thousands of pages of unorganized, un-numbered documents and said ""that looks like so much fun!"" Just finished and can honestly say I'm blown away by the themes of truth, justice, and courage in The Post. As a former film student, this movie reminded me of something my professors always taught me:

A film should always portray what is, and what ought to be. Maybe it is just the people I follow online who have been critiquing it negatively. But I loved this movie. It was very fast paced and tense and had a nice sprinkle of humor in it. I truly enjoyed it, don’t get some of the people hating on it. I didn't know anything about this movie, I didn't even know it was directed by Speilberg. It's a great movie because you can constantly feel the tension. Every choice they make, every little thing that happens, can prevent the people from getting justice.  There were times when I saw someone walk in a parking lot, and I was legit scared they would assassinated. The fear ran through the whole movie, and you really felt that it was a small paper fighting an empire.

The scenes when Meryll had to make the decision between profits and justice were incredible. In a time where everyone chooses profits, it was refreshing and exhilarating to see someone make decisions for the good of the country instead of quarterly profits.  It didn’t break the mold, it did nothing absolutely amazing, and yet it was one of my favorites of 2017. As a social studies teacher, I’m pretty much always a sucker for historical dramas (specifically by Spielberg) and the performances and direction was just great.

9/10 All in all a good movie, won't be watching it again. Not what I expect from Spielberg, the dude can direct brilliantly in his sleep, and that's what he did on this movie. 

Hanks was miscast. There's an constant disadvantage while casting that role, everyone will have Jason Robards in their head, that character is fucking iconic. Not even for a single second did I buy that role. He was too ""nice"" for that role. I didn't see a newspaper editor in Hanks, I didn't see his leadership skills. I could see people getting scared of Robards in All The Presidents Men, I could see him motivating people. I think even Hanks phoned it in. Maybe a Liev Schreiber or Crowe or even DDL (if he could've gotten him). 

Taking the point of view from Streep's character was a mistake. I thought the most interesting thing in the movie was the friendly rivalry between Hanks and Stuhlbarg. Also Mathew Rhys character was more interesting. Should've stuck with him more. Streep's character was boring. She should've been supporting at best. Instead of revolving the story around Streep and Hanks, should've been an ensemble story like Spotlight with few people getting their character arc's. 

Also I got out of the movie at two places. When Hanks get's a call from Assistant Attorney General and Streep and Letts were there in the scene. It was a oner, but when the Hanks hangs up the call, the camera is on the phone, then it cuts to close up on Hanks, Streep and Letts (great blocking), it was obvious they used a different take, I think originally, the camera was supposed to pan up to that close up. Second was when Stuhlbarg receives the envelope, it was an obvious cut from a oner.

How great was Lett's? 2 Best picture nominations in a single year. Polar opposite of his role on Lady Bird.

The scene where Hanks shows Streep the other papers was brilliant. Even the scene where Coon's character reads out a justice's decision, what a brilliant scene. Would have killed it 20 years ago. But now things have changed, we need more subtly. 

The way they recreated the offices of The Post was brilliant... Felt like it popped out of All The President's Men. Very nicely recreated.  The first 30 minutes of this were unbearable. Me and my friend almost felt like walking out. But from the leak onwards, it was non stop tension. Aside from Hanks and Streep, I wasn't even aware how big the cast was. A good mix of Oscar favorites and stellar TV actors, I chuckled seeing Meth Damon and Saul bickering lol
 I was unimpressed by this movie. The story was far too slow, and once it reached the climax it was rushed. One of Spielberg’s poorer performances. This movie was like biting into a mayonnaise sandwich for me. Whitest and blandest thing I have seen in a long time. I may be the only one, but I loved the monologue that Sara Paulson gives to Tom Hanks. Way on the nose, for sure (as expected with Spielberg) - but it really resonated with me, personally. 

I forget the exact phrasing, but something about how your whole life as a woman you’re told what you should be, that eventually you just start to believe it. And to break free from that takes an incredible amount of strength - something that many men aren’t able to understand. And to have Hanks’ character listen and respond to what she is saying (instead of debate or argue) feels so...wonderfully hopeful. Definitely heavy handed, yes. But it worked for me.  First movie ever that caused me to fall asleep The plot was stretched way too thin. One of the most blatant cases of Oscar bait in recent memory, the film felt half-finished in a rushed attempt to maintain relevancy but sacrifices quality Overall a good movie imo.

I felt the feminist subplot was very fair and portrayed well. Which was a pleasant surprise, because some reviews I saw claimed it was too SJW. The only time I felt it was forced or over-the-top was when [Graham was walking out of the Supreme Court through the crowd of women as if she was Jesus](#spoiler).

As for the movie overall, I liked it. Many people in the comments are saying the first half was boring, and I can understand that. However, I'm not so sure I can agree. My theater was full and engaged throughout the movie, so that could be a factor in my disagreement. 

Me and a friend have been trying to see all the potential oscar nominated films lately, and we both agreed that while this movie is deserving of a nomination we think it doesn't quite compete with the other ""Oscar-bait"" films of this year.  When they were going to court, that felt like it should have been the tipping point into act two, but it was pretty much the climax of the film. Boring. Oscar bait, the movie: the movie The 1st half is so boring. It picks up in the 2nd half. This wasn't peak Spielberg but more like bridge of spies Spielberg.

Can't wait for the watergate sequel.  What did everyone think of JW's work? I've listened to the score a few times now and I really like it. He wasn't used very heavily in the movie, but when he was he definitely made it count and the music really added to the immediacy of what was happening on the screen. After hearing this score it kinda makes me bummed that he didn't get to do Bridge of Spies. I loved Bridge of Spies, but the one thing that felt off to me about that movie was the score. When I hear Newman's music I don't feel like I'm watching a Spielberg movie because I feel like his music is not as organic as JW's. Don't get me wrong, Newman is a great composer, but I just don't think a Newman-Spielberg collaboration worked for me. I liked the film. I couldn't help but smirk at how it ended - it was as if they gave it the Marvel cliff-hanger twist ending, but for the next embarrassing chapter of American history.  

One thing that flew over my head though: I did not understand their nervousness about being legally held in contempt for sharing the same source. Can somebody explain how having the same news source would be a legal liability? How many times did a phone-ringing mark the end of a conversation, interaction, or scene? Such a slow, boring movie. I guess it wasn’t made for me. Saw it on the plane yesterday. I don't get the acclaim. You might as well have named it *Rich White Socialite Makes Hard Decision For Once In Her Life*. Kay is not a sympathetic protagonist. Oh, boo-hoo, you were born into a life of opulence and now you have to make a decision to maintain your lifestyle. 

Cheesy and sanctimonious. This is what *The Post* is. The scene where Kay is literally glowing walking down the steps of the Supreme Court lined with adoring smiling women with their heads following her is literally the most eye-roll inducing shot I have seen in my life. 

And then the ending. Kay says something along the lines of ""I don't think I can do *this* again"" **clapping like a seal** huh huh bravo stephen I get the reference it's so clever!! ehuh ehuh hyuck bravo!

3/10. Preachy, cheesy, and absolutely zero subtlety in its story-telling. Government BAD! Press and media GOOD!

There is one shining moment in the film - the scene where Kay is on the line with a couple other men and the camera spins around her while she listens to their arguments. That was a brilliant shot. Anyone else feel like this is being brigaded? 

I thought the film was pretty average Spielberg wise but I'm seeing a lot of hate based on the fact that they didn't feel sympathetic towards the Washington Post because it's a big paper and Meryl Streep because she was rich. Reeks of T_d blanket upvoting negative opinion about it.

Now I will say I have seen a lot of comments with valid complaints about the film and if they didn't like it I could understand. This isn't aimed towards them because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and film can be a matter of taste.

But it just leaves an odd impression seeing certainly comments gathering upvotes  Great directing, not overly obtrusive. Strong, relevant story. Doesn’t overly romanticize journalism as I worried it would (other than the last couple scenes - SCOTUS and Meryl’s preachy lesson afterwards.)

Some moments were pretty thrilling, I.e. the parallel action leading up to that wonderful shot of the building shaking as Bob Odenkirk sits at his desk. That was excellent. 

In terms of pure directorial ability, no one has yet to top Spielberg. 

Edit: downside - anyone else really taken out of the scene with Meryl’s monologue on the bed because of the overly invasive score? That score did not work there - should have just let Meryl’s amazing performance speak for itself. Can't believe I just sat throug that oscar-bait circlejerk, never been so bored during a movie. Thank you movie pass. I really enjoyed this. It is very average Spielberg drama, but it's still pretty satisfying. Never thought I'd be so pumped watching a scene of newspaper machinery and printing.

I feel like this would go pretty well in a double feature with All the President's Men too It was ok, clearly Oscar bait. There were some moments where I definitely felt they came so close to what they were trying to do but fell short.

Worth the watch, I enjoyed it, but not incredible. I really hated this movie. I'm not going to say I hated this movie but I really didn't like what the movie claimed to be vs what it actually was. The script was pretty disapointing. I think Hollywood's collective hatred for Donald Trump is going to get this movie all the big nominations at the oscars and with the really great movies that came out this year, I'll be really miffed if it goes home with any of them with exception to Bob Odenkirk for best supporting actor. I don't think he would get it, but he was the one thing I really loved about this movie. It takes time to kick into gear and the narrative becomes overstuffed in the first and second act but once the midpoint hits, it becomes riveting. In fact, I was very entertained for the vast majority of the movie. It's credit to Spielberg that he can make journalism and the printing of a paper incredibly tense, fun and cinematic!

Hanks and Odenkirk are the MVP's with Hanks balancing gruff and likability with ease. Meryl Streep is very good but can become Oscar bait-y at times.

Spielberg and Kaminski's camerawork is the highlight. There's not a better director when it comes to working with the camera than Spielberg.

Full review: https://iwandm.wordpress.com/2018/01/11/the-post-review/ I saw it in a cinema full of retired women, who murmured at every slight of Meryl Streep's character, then applauded at the end. Far be it from me to suggest r/movies is a fanboy hivemind, but I feel most people in this thread don't understand what makes the movie so true to life. The first act was mindnumbingly boring, totally unengrossing. But it grew exponentially more interesting until I actually found myself super engaged throughout.

Characters were sort of bland and just sideswept if they were not Meryl Streep or Tom Hanks, those two while adequate didn't really bring anything new to the table. This film is more about a historical narrative and triumph of an ideology than it is about human beings and the sparse sequences of humanity feel a little contrived.

Movie was too predictable, perhaps inevitably - the entire theme is of freedom of the press which is a totally one sided thing (yes, it's good) - you hence know exactly how shit goes down. And it doesn't really go down, there's no significant escalation because the film's suspense is entirely verbal. It's not visceral. The biggest tension comes from watching internal struggle and predictability sort of puts that struggle on a leash. 

That said, it's not really as tense as it is exciting to watch things speed along which is what sold me. The eventual pace of the film is engaging unlike its initial trappings. 

Ultimately, 7/10, a safe Spielberg film. Will deliver some goods but it's not at all noteworthy and it won't compel you to come back for a second watch, it's likeable enough as it stands to be a worthy flick that won't challenge you, but comfortably confirm and reassure what you already know.

 Not much else can be said that hasn't already but I'll just throw my two sense in there. The movie was thoroughly enjoyable. It told the story of this event that I didn't know all that well in a compelling way. It won't be remembered even 2 years from now but for an hour of my time, I'd say it was worth it. It's strength is definitely it's ensemble. Again, another film that has me convince we need an ensemble cast Oscar.

Side note: this will be one of the few years Meryl Streep gets an out-of-respect Oscar nom and I won't totally disagree with it. The scene with her daughter in the kids bedroom was very moving to me and during the third act I could really feel the conflict within her about whether or not to publish. The Post is a well-made movie where I didn't care about any of it. I didn't care for the characters, the newspaper, nor to the importance to free speech of publishing the Pentagon Papers. It's a confusing and dull and curious and boring feeling. I am not sure if I should be praising The Post for teaching me this new feeling or I should be annoyed at The Post for wasting my time and the importance of the story while Trump is trying to discredit the White House press. [deleted] Very disappointed we didn't get a Woodward and Bernstein cameo, unless I missed it ""I've always wanted to be a part of a small rebellion.""

No kidding. This was way better than Star Wars. How do I sign up? I quite enjoyed the film, but after sitting through the credits, I'm baffled as to why there's at least 20 stunt people listed.  What scene am I forgetting?   Just watched it last night. I thought it was ok. It depicted an event I honestly wasn't very familiar with, which was cool, but I didn't really feel any tension or attachment to the characters in the film. It ended and I thought ""cool, that's a thing that happened."" 

I dunno... I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. I feel like most of the press and hype around is just due to Trumps whole ""fake news"" thing and news outlets standing up to him. The movie seemed like a clear commentary on that, especially with the ladies dramatic phone recitation of the supreme court decision. Saw it last night and still thinking about it, so I gave it an 8. I thought the selection of background stories portrayed, combined with the overall historical view, and the atmospherics all combined with the triple black diamond expert- level acting worked really well to show this historical event.  

I read the Katherine Graham autobiography a while ago. What a life. She really was an historical figure, and rose to the occasion despite being a product of the times. She came from a privileged white southern background, and was thrown into the world of 1960's men to be their boss after her husband, who everyone loved, committed suicide. So I don't quibble with this being her story. She deserves it. 

The other aspect was that Washington was a small town. So the press wouldn't report on the politicians unfavorably. They were at dinner parties and knew each other's children. So reporting on MacNamara was another conflict. (No one liked Nixon it seems.) But, she was an outsider as a woman, and perhaps that's why she made the decision to publish. 

The movie portrays her as a female whistleblower, at great personal risk. The movie portrays Ben Bradley as trying to get personal glory by being the cowboy who isn't going to be pushed around by the Nixon whitehouse, and would gladly let her go to jail.

All this is framed in the newspaper era, with printing presses and delivery of bundles, and Royal typewriters, smokey offices and Xerox machines and steel file cabinets and pay phones. Time deadlines. And struggling financials. Arguments over morals versus sales. 

The acting was terrific, of course, with the big names. The acting for the young lawyers and interns should also be called out, as these were memorable roles, kind of the canaries in the coal mines. 

The movie pulls you into this world, from a high vantage point, and show how the right decisions are not easy. Timely lesson. >Meth Damon as Roger Clark

Brilliant Tom Hanks was great as Popeye. I like how the press solidarity thing came full circle. Hated how there's always a almost-hit-by-taxi scene in NY every time ... I feel if I ever visited NY my trip wouldn't be complete without being almost hit by one.  I aim to see every movie nominated for best picture at the Oscars every year, but for this one... I could give two shits about. Oscar bait at its finest. 

EDIT: What makes it even worse, is how this was nominated over I,Tonya. Very frustrating.  This felt like a very paint-by-numbers drama film by Spielberg, but had some great acting. Everyone brought their A-game. I was excited for this. Big names with lots of great past projects so my expectations were high. And I also love seeing stories about the behind the scenes operations of how a news story develops and is reported on. 

But I was disappointed. I thought it was weak. It unnecessarily romanticized the industry (if you read the news you already know its immense value to society). In comparison, All the Presidents Men does a much better job of demonstrating how important journalism is without needing to lean on cheesy or over the top shots like the kid holding up his Times ID like it's an FBI badge, or literally everyone in the Post newsroom holding up a copy of the Times after the story broke. (And it's very unlikely an entire room of people would hold the paper up like that to read it. At least one person is gonna fold it back and then in half, especially if it's a long article. But we needed to see the Times logo to force the point so everyone had to hold it up.)

Also so many scenes looked like you can see the movement start. Film/television is supposed to give the effect of us being a silent observer of life in motion. But throughout the movie when it cut to a new scene you could tell everyone was standing on their X,  waiting for the director to give the call and then they started the movements and dialogue. It felt unnatural/stiff in too many scenes. The early dinner scene right before McNamara alerted Kay to the Times report is an example: a few lighthearted remarks --> man says his line about politics --> everyone stands --> women go to the next room laughing/casual banter, say their few lines --> cut to men taking a seat together quickly rattling off a few lines about politics. It was a blatant juxtaposing of the men and women to tell us Kay was out of place in society running a newspaper. 

And there were quite a few cheesy shots for a director of Spielberg's caliber. A major one was toward the end where the camera is pointing to a paper on a coffee table, Hanks' character says something about the Post no longer being a small market local paper and then the camera pans up at them so the angle makes them look like giants. That's such a cheap camera trick to make a point. 

5/10. Between the writing and directing, an opportunity was missed. I think the reason for making the film distracted everyone from focusing on making a quality film. 


I think I have to watch it again because the first time I went in with really high expectations. 2nd viewing would be a clean slate.  I liked the movie, then the last 2 mins hit... and then they brought in the Watergate scandal! I had a huge grin on my face Meth Damon. Man, I saw it yesterday and am very surprised at how many of you are 'meh' on it.  I found this movie incredibly captivating. Incredible performances on screen and a pretty focused narrative.  I'll admit the start is slow, but the final 2 acts really had me completely invested.

Edit: I think Lincoln was overall a better movie, but this was not far behind. So we’re getting The Post 2 right? RIGHT?? I didnt think it was a bad movie overall. Just forgetable. Worse than  Bridge of Spies sadly, which i quite liked. 

This one just seems like most Spielberg-y movie of all. Just Spielberg on auto pilot Just saw it and it kinda reminded me of Hidden Figures last year: cool source material (particularly relevant in America these couple of years), mediocre film-making. It didn't feel genuine or authentic, parts of it were cringey af.

I find this the best work Meryl Streep has done since Angels in America, though. She was far more subtle and understated in this role than her previous 20, which worked. Tom Hanks was really vanilla, however. [deleted] Logan got snubbed for this. I'm not surprised or angry, just predictably disappointed. At least most of the other nominations this year have been solid. If you've never seen an Oscar bait film, this is a good example of one. Given it's Oscar season now and I need to see as many Best Picture nominees as possible, I saw this preemptively to make sure it was marked off my list. After the Golden Globes and Critic's Choice Awards is basically assured it'll get nominated.  
  
That said, it was a pretty good movie. I thought this was about Watergate going into it and was surprised, and happy, it wasn't, since I already know that story. Streep and Hanks are very good as anyone would expect.  
  
If you've seen *Black Mirror*'s ""USS Callister"" episode you'll also recognize someone. He did great int his and I hope they give him more feature film work. Allison Brie needed a bigger part since I kept wishing for her to be back onscreen.  
  
I'd recommend seeing this. It's an interesting take on a historical event and doesn't lose its focus. It could have easily strayed onto the Veit Nam war, but didn't, or it could have gone full White House, and it didn't. It knew the story it was trying to tell and didn't stray too far off the line.  
  
As my first paragraph touched on, if you're the type to see all the Oscar Best Picture nominations, see this one while it's out now. I'd be shocked if it wasn't nominated. Spielberg phoned this one in. He took what should have been a very interesting, timely story and made it boring. The dialogue was meh, the camera work was uninspired and the score (from John Williams, no less) was forgettable. Honestly, I thought that Odenkirk probably had the most interesting performance, even though everyone is only buzzing about Streep/Hanks.

2017 was an extremely competitive year. I understand that the Academy is apparently obligated to give noms to Spielberg, Streep, and Hanks, but I'll be very disappointed if anybody actually wins anything for this one. While I enjoyed the film, I do think Meryl Streep is actually a detriment to what's going on here.  Minor Spielberg, another in a recent streak of minor films. Proficiently made, but ultimately I found it too neat and tidy. A fantastic cast really had nothing to do, except for Streep. Distinctively Spielberg both good and bad: expertly directed and shot (Januz brought the pain and the filters), but Spielberg is about as subtle as a bag of hammers sometimes. In one scene, women excuse themselves from the dinner table to go talk about clothes, while the men talk about "" important things that women shouldn't be involved with"". In another scene, Hanks' wife hands out sandwiches because of course, that's all women did back then and Spielberg wants us to know it. 

 The fact that this got an Oscar nom for Best Picture and Streep for best actress just shows how political they've gotten , how terrible the choices offered from Hollywood are, and how Oscar bait works so well in a town that just wants to promote itself. This was GARBAGE compared to The Florida Project, 3 Billboards, and Ingrid Goes West.   I just saw this movie, and it made me weep.  We need such courage today.  We are facing a threat unlike anything this nation has faced, perhaps ever in its history, as the threat is coming from those who we chose to lead us.  They are threatening every freedom we love, for if there is any one liberty which underlies every other right that matters to us, it is the freedom to speak truth to power.

Long live a free press. Nice film. 
Hilarious moment with Zack Woods where he asked if there was any need for all the profanity.
Strong supportive cast with solid pacing.
Both Hanks and Streep had well defined characters.
The ending was a bit on the nose, but the overall product was wonderful in execution.
7/10.
 Loved Bradley Whitford! Anyone else think he was a dead ringer for Harry S. Truman? Would love to see him tackle that role. Hm... kind of bored and interested. Somehow overall, the story felt ...just slowly stepping on. 

Well, about the actors and roles: 

* Meryl Streep was quite underwhelming. 

* Tom Hanks played a roarier and bossier version of Chesley Sullenberger. 

* The converastions in general felt like they were specifically orchestrated to feel hectic or something, when they talked over one another.

In some scenes, Spielberg's way of blocking came through. Or something, that felt quite distinct and at points if felt too weird, even in relation to watching a movie. Like when they all watched the cardboard box that Bob Odenkirk's Ben brought in. This is one of Meryl Streep's best performances in a while, but on the whole, The Post is just alright. Meryl Streep has a great performance and her arc, going from a well-connected socialite who stumbled into owning the paper and lacks confidence in the face of a male-dominated social order to someone willing to put everything on the line for the sake of the integrity of the Post and the press in general, is strong. Heck, I also really liked most of the rest of the cast, especially Bob Odenkirk. The problem is the script in most other respects is pretty weak: the first hour absolutely crawls, the dialogue is mediocre and outside of Streep's Kay Graham, none of the characters are particularly interesting. Hank's is probably the most disappointing performance, as he basically just scrunches his face and has a gravely voice as ""generic gruff newspaperman"" and doesn't have a patch on Jason Robard's performance of Ben Bradlee in All the President's Men. Finally, for all the star power not in front of the camera, this is the least inspired work from Janusz Kaminski or John Williams that I can remember. 

Meryl Streep's performance and character are enough to make up for a lot of the shortcomings, but The Post can't get past an extremely clunky start and a flawed script. In ranking Spielberg's informal series of ""American ideals tested"" movies, it's definitely behind Lincoln and about the same level as Bridge of Spies and Amistad. I thought the film’s main conflict, the decision to publish or not, was handled expertly and the character’s decision-making process was compelling and believable. The scene with everyone on the phone with Meryl making the decision was incredible. People in my theater actually cheered!

I think the criticisms of the film are warranted, but it is well acted and exceptionally timely. 

 So Good! Cant believe the lukewarm responses I'm reading around here. I guess maybe the MCU is what people are looking for these days. Either way, after watching Black Panther last night, this movie was such a refreshing change. 

- The Pacing was tight and the story moved along nicely

- I don't watch much Streep movies but I see what all the hype is about now. She definitely is a legend

- Hanks was also good. I realized how much I missed watching him after seeing this

- Spielberg's directing was great. I see a lot of comments about how it had no visual appeal. Are people crazy? I mean firstly, its a movie about a newspaper releasing a story, your not going to get landscapes and CG and stuff that people would call beautiful. BUT every was well shot, and the shots of the newspaper printing machines and presses were definaately visually interesting

- The dialogue was well written. There was some genuinely funny/cute moments

- The acting all around was spot on. 

- And the movie DOES have an important message. This movie needs to be seen by more people.  Only on reddit could you have people ragging on Meryl Streep and Sara Paulson and claim it's not misogyny. This was an incredible film all around, but the real highlight was the acting. Streep delivers a fantastic, nuanced performance. Streep and Hanks have great chemistry. Hanks is electric. All members of the supporting cast play their parts well and there are really no weak points or even awkward moments.

In terms of writing, the plot was engaging and easy to follow. Clearly though, it was of secondary concern to the themes of the movie.

If you felt that messages of freedom of the press and female empowerment were over the top, you are probably exactly the kind of person this movie was made for. This movie critiques the society of the time as well as our own. It provides insight into a larger world of corruption, class stratification, and government deception while shining a bright light on misogyny in the work place and attempts to silence the press by the government. None of this was over the top or forced, it was all a natural part of this true story.

Not the best movie of the year nor my favorite (Blade Runner wins both in my opinion) but I feel this is an excellent movie that could please anyone.  In the Post episode of Blank Check, one of the hosts says hat a lot of Spielberg True Story movies end with Spielberg telling you the point of the movie in case you didn't get it, and this happens about three times in this movie. But other than that, this is a finely directed movie anchored by Hanks, Streep, and Odenkirk. 

For the few Theme Explainer scenes, Spielberg generally undercuts the typical Oscar Moment scenes, to his credit.  Decent although easily one of Spielberg’s weaker films. Loved Streep and Hanks though, they were excellent as usual  Is someone able to tell me the name of the song the hippie protesters were playing outside the stock exchange? What purpose did cutting off the page numbers and the ""top secret"" marking serve?

It seems like everything was in order in the hotel room, how/why did they get out of order? Saw this today.  Quite enjoyed it, although I was confused by the very end.  I couldn't make out what the security guy said and feel like I missed a reference.  Can anyone fill me in? Of the Spielberg civics lessons this one was the worst of the bunch. Still good because Spielberg is still Spielberg but it felt like they could have done another draft on everything. one detail that annoyed me, who puts their pencils point up in their pencil holders? seriously, 3 scenes in the movie had this tiny detail, and it bugged the hell out of me. Do you want to get stabbed when you reach for a pencil? because thats how you get stabbed with a pencil. Bob Odenkirk caressing plot devices: the movie. I was really unhappy with Meryl Streep in this movie. She really lowered the bar for herself in this one. It was very clear to me I was watching her, and not her character in this film.  Drinking game for those who want to get drunk: Take a shot every time movie cuts to someone smiling. 

This movie is truly uninspired and lazy. Worst performance i have ever seen by Meryl Streep. 
 Considering I expected something extremely bland, I was actually a little surprised. Sure, it wasn't really anything special, but it was basically Speilburg ""Spotlight"" (which I loved), so I didn't mind too much.

That being said, most of the stuff involving Streep (beyond her making a decision) was pretty boring, and it became kind of hilarious how anytime her character stepped outside she immediately was surrounded by a crowd of women giving her approving nods.

Still, it was pretty enjoyable, although it doesn't really hold much of a candle to the other best picture hopefuls like Lady Bird, Three Billboards, etc. The movie is good, but there is just nothing special about it. 

Another unmemorable Spielberg film.  This movie is astonishingly dull, honestly. Although a half decent cast and perfectly fine directing. No one is doing anything we haven't seen a thousand times before. It's dull and painfully uninspired.     This movie was fine and functional. Nothing spectacular happened. I don't think it is deserving of any awards (maybe a few nominations? Don't know which).

 In fact, I left felling a little bitter that they ended on Watergate rather than just leaving it be. Yes, you want to make comparisons and a commentary on our current political state but it unnecessary and detracted from the rest of the film.  I for one thought that the last 40 or so minutes of the film were exhilarating.  THEY KNEW I thought the movie was OK, if lacking, and definitely Oscar bait. I was getting into it during the second act when the actual papers part of the story came into play and the journalists doing their job came into play, but they stretched the good parts way too thin over the entire runtime and filled it in with dramatized historical fiction tropes. 

The movie ended up becoming so cheesy in the end, where everybody not on Bradlee's side was a cookie-cutter bad guy. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge proponent of journalism (having been one myself professionally), but I hate the pat-on-the-back style movies where it's set up so smugly. Hindsight is 20/20, and the legal threats were very serious. Journalism is never cut and dry, and there's always doubts about doing the right thing, which I don't think they handled as well as movies like All the President's Men and Spotlight did. It's why the Newsroom grated on me so much.

Not to mention, they through in way too many cheesy moments, especially at the end, to the point where they were treating the viewer as dumb. ""Oh hey, just in case you can't tell you're the protagonist, we're going to have an aide for the opposite side of the court case come tell you she believes in you and you made the right decision."" ""Oh hey, in case you didn't realize the significance of a woman in power making a decision and getting a major victory against men, let's throw in a bunch of women clapping close up after the fact."" I was able to understand that fine without the cheese factor, thank you.

Also, John Williams' score was way too cheesy.



 I really enjoyed this film and enjoyed the journalism aspects of it and showing the insides of a newsroom and the printing presses. Most importantly, can't forget the important case this movie is based off of (Times v. United States) Such a shame that Meryl will once again take the nomination of a more deserving performance.  Easily one of Spielberg’s worst movies. The pace was so slow. The performances were good but not enough overcome that for me. There just was a lifelessness to it all.  Oh good, I managed to see an earlier screening of this.

Yeah I positively hated this movie.

I despise Streep's character with a vengeance. She's unlikable and largely comes across as incompetent, and the scenes of trying to paint her as some* sort of paragon of feminism are hysterical.

I don't give a shit about this (even at the time) 7 digit value company. Seriously, your family newspaper with hundreds of employees and that makes you the hero to root for? All done in that fake Streep humility to boot? 

Fuck. That.

I mildly enjoyed Tom Hanks, but even then he was pretty much always Tom Hanks playing the part, which is probably half Hanks and half writing. Which, in this movie, was a complete groaner. 

Everything felt so calculated in the worst way possible. Those ""sweeping"" orchestra tunes coming in, those usual shout for your Oscar speeches, that goddamn dramatic close up of the court reading at the end? Are you kidding? I'm a pretty petty person, I admit, but it's like this movie was designed to irritate me. I levied the same criticism against Darkest Hour, but it feels somewhat like a pretense of a movie for awards and milquetoast political self-satisfaction. 

For me personally, this was my least favorite movie of 2017. Giving awards to this movie is a goddamn embarrassment. It's a lazy, mediocre if not poorly made, limp slap on current political affairs for people to pat themselves on the back about. Take that, conservatives! We made an incredibly bland movie about the little guy - the Washington Post! Now owned by the richest man in the world! Subscribe now! Haven't watch the movie, but I cry-laughed at the google results for ""Meth Damon"". Gosh, I'm in tears. Okay so here is my take on the post, First half is boring and if i were to give it a rating it would be like a 4/10 or something like that, good acting but just boring. second half i would give maybe an 8/10. When everything becomes more intense so does the movie and it gets better. Again though overall this is boring. 

Positives include the acting (Of course). Meryl and Tom were once again great but i mean were we expecting anything else. I could tell that some of the scenes were improvised by them two but it wasn't obvious they just worked really well with each other.

Negatives: Lazy, slow and it feels like Steven saw Spotlight 2 years ago and went 'Hey, I think i can do better' so he rounded up his best actors and took a well known story and played it out and in theory it should have worked, In theory this film SHOULD
 be winning the oscars, not because of the oscar bait but because of the team behind the camera, but theories arent always correct and i would actually be mad if this got nominated, but it probably will so not much i can do 

If your thinking of watching it watch it, but if you have your eye on other films maybe try them first before seeing this.
 Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep were amazing in this movie. You understand immediately that you have legends here. really... really... dry Meth Damon hahahahaha Nothing too special of a film, but it gets the job done. One thing I can say is that Spieldberg knows how to move the camera and frame a shot to constantly keep the movie visually interesting; in particular, the scenes with the printing press were a joy to watch. Most of the acting was just good, though a few characters including Bob Odenkirk's just felt a bit out of place. I appreciate the feminist and political messages that the film is trying to get across, though in some scenes especially near the end it just got so heavy handed that it was basically the actors and screen writers winking at the camera and it really took me out of it. And that ending was just so cringey...it just seemed like it was an intro film into a new political cinematic universe and really ended the film on a bad note.  Spielberg just gets it, knows how to engage even someone with no idea about the matter at hand. Exceptional movie. Did Allison Brie's accent bother anyone else? I couldn't understand what she was trying to go for or why it changed in different parts of the film. Usually she is great in her roles but she annoyed me in this because of that fact. 


I also agree with the ""no real tension"" etc aspect since it's a simple plot and pretty much anyone interested in this film already knows the story. The theatre I saw it in had people clapping and cheering throughout the entire film which had me groaning and rolling my eyes. I can't stand how this has become commonly acceptable and people think it's ok to disrupt other peoples enjoyment of the film. 🙄 I haven't seen the film, but for every person saying the film is a Oscar bait one : all of Spielberg's films are. Not because he wants Oscars everytime he does a film, but because he is that good of a film-maker. This was just do dry and dull. Speilberg just isn't what he used to be. Eh, judging by the way the media handled the Iraq War, and everything else sense Watergate (basically by becoming stenographers for elite consensus), nothing seems to have really been gained long term from all of this.

They still parroted everything that GWB had to say. They still parroted out endless paeans to the glories of austerity, they still repeated that no laws had been broken in the great crash (even as I read legal analysis after analysis that said tons of laws were broken).

They got one right in a sea of narcissistic circle-jerking. And only after years of enabling Nixon and LBJ. And they will never stop patting themselves on the back for it. Important to note—this was a huge auditorium. 

8 people walked into my screening. 4 people walked out. 

Sad to say I was one of them.  Found this one pretty boring. I just couldn't emphasize with the rich owners of the newspapers no matter how many times they told how important this story was. It didn't help that Kay Graham is portrayed as an out of touch scared lackey. Even when she gets her big moment, first they had to get her to leave a fancy dinner party. 

And for such an amazing cast, the performances were mostly meh. It was probably because the script was so on the nose all the time. 

I would have rather have seen a movie about Daniel Ellsburg instead of the guy who hired him.  After just seeing the Post, I'm happy that so many others are very disappointed with this film. And none of the Hollywood tricks of the trade seemed to work on most of the viewers here on Reddit. 

This is the type of Oscar Bait garbage that critics of Hollywood are talking about. Gender Studies wins again. I may be a tad harsh, but this is just garbage. Do they think we're this dumb? To be forcefed like this?  Here is my quick review. Skip it. Read on for a spoiler free review...

I forgot that Spielberg had directed! I was SHOCKED because during the movie I kept thinking how uninspired the directing choices seemed. How ""mechanical"" everything seemed staged. The lighting heavy handed. Such as the Supreme Court steps scene, or ANY of the ""protest"" scenes. The Oscar bait of the boardroom meeting, the poor choices of following the boring storyline because it involves the woman being the smartest person in the room filled with men. The female assistant being ""inspired"" despite her boss. Tom Hanks was trying hard, Streep got too much screen time and her wardrobe sabotaged her character. Was she wearing a curtain as a dress the entire 2nd half of the movie?? Her scene with Allison Brea at the end was just word salad. Meh. Sarah Paulson is wasted here. The first half is a sleeper of a history drag. The music lets us down in keeping the overwhelmingly Baby boomer audience awake. We've somehow seen all of this before, could it be Spotlight?!?!? But done so so much better. Yes, there are thinly veiled reminders of Trumps anti-media biases. That lesson is made clear, several times. But ultimately this movie fails because it chose the wrong characters to focus on. The real intrigue and action should have been with the military analysts who committed espionage with his theft of the pentagon papers, or Bob Odenkirk's character getting back into the old feeling of being part of a ""small rebellion"" again with his reporting.  But no. We are forced to learn again, that women are just as good as men even though they are forced by men to focus on dinner parties, style sections, and making sandwiches. Gender Studies Hollywood is teaching us again. Lastly, think back to that absolutely HORRIBLE opening scene in Vietnam. Is this really the same director who gave us Saving Private Ryan? That was the most cliched Vietnam footage I've ever seen. Including the musical choice of CCR.  

Bottom Line, skip this movie and watch Spotlight again.  Just out of interest, how was David Cross? Never seen him in a serious role before and the hairpiece looks a bit distracting but apparently it's a small role (he plays Martin Balsam's character in *All the President's Men*) Pretty much leads straight into *All the President's Men* tbh I almost burst into laughter during the break-in scene because I suddenly remembered that scene in *Forrest Gump*. I left thinking ""Damn, now I want Spielberg to do Watergate"" right before remembering All The President's Men exists. As soon as I saw the scene of [Nixon on the telephone shitting on the press I laughed out loud hard as hell, and seized some confused glances through the cinema, because I knew a Watergate scene would come. Then the Watergate scene came, and commence other people's laughter too.](#spoiler) Watching a movie about historical events where they constantly reference other historical events for people who didn't study history must be what it's like when normal people watch Marvel movies. Overall I enjoyed the film but I disagree with the praise for this scene. It really was emblematic of the problem the film had with being too on-the-nose. The call the officer makes was unnecessary and just served to really really make sure the audience understood the joke.

It reminded me of earlier in the movie when Mrs. Bradlee explains to her husband how much Ms. Graham had at stake by publishing. Nobody talks like that - it was dialogue inserted to make sure the audience ""got it.""  As a huge fan of Mr. Show, I honestly had a hard time separating myself from that fact every time they were on screen together In that payphone scene it looked like Bob finally got [change for his dollar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGuT97v4pv0) I was so utter fascinated by the machinery. I could have watched footage of that for an hour.

Give me a film like Koyaanisqatsi, but with 100% machinery.  I loved the linotype machines making their appearance. Apparently they shot a shitload of footage just of linotype and printing press machine shots. I don't think the movie is at all super feminist, but yeah, that scene was just *odd*.  Girl starts talking, everyone pays attention, fat whit dude interrupts and steals her line.  wtf?  Even from just a movie telling perspective the interruption is jarring and doesn't seem to serve any purpose.  And *then* she goes ahead and awkwardly repeats the inspirational quote from the ruling.   It was a weird moment. I was wondering if he won a role in the movie in a contest or something. Was it on the nose? I would say yes, but to a degree, it sort of felt realistic to me. Just because one woman got a win, doesn't mean the entire culture surrounding her doesn't change at once.  that scene completely threw me, it looked like they added it in after the final edit as he comes from an empty office with no one around him (and the girl has the entire company's attention).  the people I was with thought it was intended to show a man stealing the woman's thunder, but it just was weird and actually made me like the movie less, i wish i lol'd instead i wtf'd You are selling it short. This movie was effing fantastic.  >  I am totally for the messages presented in the film, but a lot of it seemed heavy handed, where I almost expected the actors to turn and wink at the camera. Almost felt like propaganda, but for my team.

What, you didn't like the scene where Streep is walking down the steps with sunlight shining down upon her while protesters looked upon her in reverence, and she somehow picked a path through the group that only had women?
 >but a lot of it seemed heavy handed, where I almost expected the actors to turn and wink at the camera. Almost felt like propaganda, but for my team.
The cinematography felt strange. It had a very fluorescent light feel. Not complaining, just noting. Did anyone else think Tom Hanks kept slipping in and out of accent?


True that! I thought it would have been better to make a serious drama than a comic-drama movie. The subject of the story demanded it, just imagine if Lincoln 2012 had the same casual screenplay!! >High school history class 

Apt, considering I *did* go see it with my high school history class. Perhaps the ending of *The Post* leads to *All the President's Men* the same way the ending of *Rogue One* leads to *A New Hope*? There doesn't need to be a sequel because the sequel already exists. Just my two cents.   They could redo Frost/Nixon. Nick Fury: I'm here to talk about the Scandal Initiative 

Richard Nixon Will Return  Does it include Robot Nixon’s re-election in 3004? If so, I’m all in. watching USS Callister the night before I saw this didn't help with the fact that I could only picture Tom Hanks in a simulation of Meth Damon's game every time he crossed him. The subtle cast memes are fucking great. Like how All the Money in the World credited Kevin Spacey as Sir Not Appearing in This Film and I, Tonya's ""*screenplay* *by* Captain America"" I think movie theaters are figuring it out. Heated recliners plus food/ticket specials. I love my local theater. I bet the mall was coal-powered too.  The way it immediately transitioned over from Nixon ranting against the WP to the guys breaking into the DNC had a good bit of my theater laughing In the future I'd recommend watching this then transitioning into All The President's Men then loathing the history of our republic. Is that how it really happened? He barred the Washington post all together and then Watergate happened, in my opinion, what they made seem was like the next day? It could've been cheesy but it ended up being my favorite part of the film.

The Nixon-to-Watergate transition was brilliant. > The bulk of the movie, following all these people doing the reporting is quite exciting although I wish more time was dedicated to spending time with Daniel Ellsberg and some of the attempts to actually get the Pentagon papers out into the public record like Sen. Mike Gravel actually reading them on the senate floor. It's a tight movie but not expansive in the ways it could have been.

That would have been interesting.

I honestly would have liked more intrigue and suspense in the style of *All The President's Men*.

Something about the tone of that movie really hits home about what a bombshell Woodward and Bernstein had stumbled on, and their efforts to carefully put the puzzle together and tease out the truth.

I understand it's probably not *really* the point of the movie but it would have been cool if they'd put one or two more scenes in to fulfil that. I understand your point of Spielberg's directing style of making things obvious, but I have to say that as a woman, I really appreciated the gesture. I can't tell you how many of us have worked in a ""boys club"" work environment and had been conditioned to being constantly interrupted, undermined, and underestimated.  The camerawork during the scenes inside The Washington Post really impressed me. The Post seems exactly like the sort of films that were super popular more than twenty years ago. Cast of A-listers, big name director, dramatized events of something from recent American history, not overtly controversial. Absolutely the sort of thing that would draw in an older crowd There was an old lady in my showing who excitedly yelled “Fuck yeah!” when Streep shut down Bradley Whitford. It was kind of adorable.  Yeah, I showed up at a 12:30 pm showing today and my theater was PACKED with old people. They really got into it too, like you said, and clapped at all the big speech moments, haha. It was really quite adorable! When I saw it last week, I was the only person I saw there under 50 You’re surprised to see more people at The Post? Are you serious? It’s Spielberg vs a cheesy Action movie. It’s not even close... I did the same double feature but commuter was sold out while the post was just me (an employee ) and an employee’s brother. It was the 9:50 pm showing however.  Same here. I walked into the movie with very few expectations and was blown away by how great it was. 
 This was the best bit of acting in the whole movie. Very emotionally charged. ""Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's do it. Let's publish."" And the way she just slams down the phone before anyone can talk her out of it. And the adrenaline shakes. 

Overall the movie was fairly hackneyed. The expository dialogue was so over the top at some points. But this scene, real good. Where’d you see the movie if you don’t mind me asking? I kept thinking ""that's David Cross's voice"", but the character didn't look like him at all, so I thought I must have been wrong. Then the credits proved me right.  him next to Bobby Oedenkirk, reminisced to my days on Mr Shiw *Wipes away tear.* Tobias, he finally got his big break as an ac-tor. I'm surprised, but not that surprised by the reaction. I absolutely enjoyed every minute. It's not a perfect movie, but technically it is perfectly executed. I had as much fun just watching Spielberg direct (hell the lighting was incredible, that motel scene!) as I did watching the story unfold. I haven't seen All the President's Men, but I did watch Spotlight pretty recently, and I don't think it's a fair comparison to make at all. Spotlight is about investigative reporting, and building a massive case out of what initially looked like very little evidence. This movie gives us all the evidence right at the beginning. It's more about the ethical responsibility of the news to report the truth, even if it could send them all to jail.  As soon as it opened with *that* CCR song I knew I was in for some hokey auto pilot Spielberg shit. Daniel Ellsberg's memoir goes into far more detail and while this ultimately centers around the Washington Post's efforts to publish them. I feel like it was a wasted opportunity to use the Washington Post as a medium to expand the scope instead of smoothing it out to make something that has a message so specifically tailored to this moment in time.  Wow, are you me? Cause i thought the bit about spotlight was my idea. Spot on. [deleted] Was pretty disappointed in the cinematography too  It's probably gonna get a lot of flak but I couldn't help but love that ending scene.

Even if my eyes did roll to the back of my head when Streep delivers that 'hopefully this doesn't happen again' or whatever line right before the Watergate scene lol. > I feel like this is getting misidentified as a prestige film because it’s way more of a blockbuster in its verve (hell, Williams score sounds like a damn action film at times). It’s a film about the flow of information, and Spielberg kind of captures that invisible kineticism with his camera and blocking. There’s a lot of overhead shots of papers flying in and out of frame and people moving from location to location. This movie may **feel** relatively rote but the Beard does still have great technical skill and feeling.


>Also I know people hate it but the ending to this is so goofy I kind of love it.

I don't know if it should have gone that far, but maybe it was thematically appropriate.

[The Nixon administration and Justice Department's argument was that they were justified in seeking to prevent the Pentagon Papers from being published not because they were ashamed or embarrassed of what was in them, but because of the supposed impact on the ability of the federal government to function.](#spoiler)

[So it sort of makes sense that the movie is then book-ended by Watergate, it's the Nixon administration's stance on the Pentagon Papers issue taken to its philosophical extreme. Them thinking that because they're the lawmakers in Washington, that they make the law and are allowed to bend it to their will.](#spoiler)

[Like Ellsberg said, it's an ""I am the state, I am the law."" stance that takes the presumption that any action taken to bring light to what the government is doing, is implicitly treason.](#spoiler) [The End Credits action cue was quite good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnOD5TjCltQ).

It actually ties into his opening to [Nixon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuCP11WAyz8) quite well. Eh, I get why but it showed how much they looked up to her. Women really were looked down as lesser people so when Kay gets a win like she did, its huge for those kinda people. Though I did like the scene on the day of the IPO and she passes a group of secretaries up the stairs. [deleted] All of these scenes involving hippie protesters didn't work for me. Something about the way those scenes were filmed, maybe the lighting or the wardrobes or the performances of the extras, but it just seemed so fake. Like filmed in a studio with extras on with default hippie costumes on. Just totally took me out of the movie. 

I agree that the scene with her coming down the stairs surrounded by starry eyed young women was a bit too much. It was just so on the nose what they were trying to do, it didn't work at all.

Overall a good movie still but those scenes didn't work at all for me. > It’s almost as if Spielberg rolled out of bed and directed a movie with all his buddies

That was what kind of happened. He read the script in February and decided he wanted to make it in 2017 and he had the movie finished by December.  Just like Bridge of Spies Agreed. I'm a lifelong not-a-fan of Spielberg but he did a surprisingly thorough job of ruining a good story and a great cast. I really wish this film had been directed by Aaron Sorkin. This movie was so sloppy, it honestly makes me wonder whether he slapped this one together during coffee breaks from Ready Player One.

* too much vaseline on the lens when Hanks was standing around looking heroic

* awkward period costumes that looked like cheap 2017 retro outfits from TJ Maxx Outlet, especially the hippies

* too many oddly silent moments in between a lot of muffled crosstalk scenes

* unbelievable dialogue

* even Hanks' accent seemed off or overdone

* that courtroom walk scene - it's like all the extras were told to do that Nic Cage insane ""You don't say!"" face while Streep walked past - WHY?! the beginning and build up were better than the ending.  especially the scene where the girl is on the phone and has the attention of the entire paper.  as she's about to read the outcome the weirdest shot happened, of an old man coming out of his office announcing they won.  then it cut back to the crowd and girl on phone cheering.  looked so out of place, like they plugged in the old man scene later or something #spoiler  I completely agree with you except for the ending. If we're both talking about showing [the Watergate break-in](#spoiler). I found that ending extremely satisfying. Other than that, very weak Oscar bait. Likewise, the press must no abrogate their commitment to telling the actual truth.  The mainstream press simply isn't what it used to be.  The 24hrs news cycle and internet sensationalism have combined to make conventional press outlets more like E! and less like Brinkley or Concrite.  

That said, I absolutely agree with you that freedom of the press (and free speech) is crucial to a free country.  However, the signal-to-noise ratio is ridiculous at times.  That's why no *one* news agency is my source.  I read articles from various perspectives from a news aggregation service on the internet.   My number one pet peeve of the movie -- they treated the audience as idiots.

* Sarah Paulson had to spell out Meryl's character's struggles and evolution, as you said.
* In case you didn't know that the movie was about a woman making a key decision over the advice of key men and about making the right choice, we had to have that scene at the Supreme Court with the gov't paralegal telling Meryl that she's an inspiration and made the right choice (""don't tell my boss lol"") plus al the women on the steps clapping in an obvious closeup.
* Was the ending a victory for journalism? Maybe the audience isn't sure, let's have our characters reference that ENDLESSLY beyond any hope of the fourth wall.

I can keep going but it really started to grind my gears by the end. There was a lot of over-explaining of the movie's themes. These things were obvious and shouldn't have had to have been spelled out, yet they were for some reason.

Enjoyable movie for the most part but there were some weird decisions made in the script. Personally I'd give it a 6.5 or 7/10. I agree! Although, Sarah Paulson's monologue has actually stuck with me. She made a huge impact in the short amount of screen time she had. Never felt slow paced to me . Every time the camera was handheld. My head was running. Spielberg’s cinematography is still baffling and fun . There were some great insert shots indeed with the papers  I think the film’s original female screenwriter’s focus on female characters shows. Not necessarily a bad thing obviously - for the most part, I enjoyed Kay as a character. But moments like Brie’s and Paulson’s speechifying felt contrived or disingenuous considering the stakes are a *little* higher than receiving a little learning lesson from domesticates! I think it’s a bit fresh that we don’t see the film largely from Ellsburg’s perspective, but when unecessary, cloying scenes like those come into play, I totally get why people are arguing that he and other figures should’ve been given a greater role. I didnt even realize it WAS Brie until her last scene in the bedroom

Also how the fuck did Sarah Paulson get third billimg Thematically speaking, I saw two main points that required a focus on the Post over the Times.

* The Post became a major national paper as a result of this story. There was a heavy emphasis on the financial peril the paper was in, and that it ended up leading the way by backing up the Times without having the same resources available to it.

* Bradlee and Graham were personally very cozy with the Kennedy admin, including holdover Bob McNamara and had to make a choice whether to protect their access, or protect their 1st amendment right to publish. Just speculation, but the story itself was probably more interesting with the whole underdog angle. It's not a case of making one paper or the other look like the hero. The hero here was clearly Daniel Ellsberg who leaked the papers. 

I suspect The Washington Post was chosen because in narrative storytelling terms it works better. They are playing catch-up, they're panicking, they get the papers and then The Times have the court injunction put upon them so it creates the big dilemma for The Post.

They had also just floated on the stock market and their owner was a good friend of McNamara who wrote the report. There was more conflict and more jeopardy. 

It made sense for us to see it from the POV of the staff at the Post as that's where the most interesting narrative was happing.    ""Whose.""  No agenda, but this movie is nothing without the Streep-as-Graham-maybe-out-of-her-depth storyline.  The Times equivalent with a worried Abe Rosenthal or Punch Sulzberger wouldn't have worked.

Also, the movie is very clear on the Times' primary role in the scoop vs. the Post's secondary one. Word has it Jeff Bezos secretly paid off Spielberg /s Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos.   Paid $250 Million for them in 2013.  [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynKoZD-sFi4)

 very cool, very cool  Ha ha that is true. Does this mean the current Russia investigation is like The Force Awakens? Yeah that scene in particular was very heavy handed.  I'm not even really sure why it was in there but it was really distracting. > Also, when did it become a law that every Vietnam-era film has to open with CCR?

IDK man, I'm 36 and it's been this way for as long as I remember. I said the EXACT same thing. And that was the worst cliched Vietnam scene EVER. This from the guy that gave us Saving Private Ryan. Pathetic.  The Nixon Cinematic Universe movies should have Henry Kissinger pop up in cheery cameos, just like Stan Lee. Ellsberg story has been told time and time again. I think focusing on the business side of the Washington Post at the time really added something interesting instead of just focusing on the journalism side of it. 
 Congratulations, you got advertised to.  They've been doing fantastic work over the past year for sure. They even shitpost, to a degree, in /r/Politics Laughing a lot about ""Meth Damon"". Did not realize that was a widespread nickname for him but it is too perfect, and he pops up right away if you google that. Amazing. Todd trying to strong arm Saul Goodman was certainly unexpected. Odenkirk would have been good, but he could have also played the role of the Post's legal council.. he has some experience.. Well, that sucks because we know the answer. It was kind of boring TBH.  You know that IRL the Post published the papers, so, there was no real tension. Honestly, I feel that way about Spielberg in general. He's a good director still, but it all feels very...outdated. nice.  gives ""I've always wanted to be a part of a small rebellion"" more meaning.

 I need to see All pres' men... I don't know her full story, care to explain? My audience had a contest of who could laugh and show they got it the most Movie WAS fantastic. Directing was great. Pacing was spot on. Performances were great from every participant. People just have bad taste.  Just got done watching, this was apparent to me as well. Very obvious similarities between the Executive Branch now and then.  The quote was fucking cringeworthy levels of cheese.  The entire film I thought Coon's character was familiar but couldn't figure out who it was. At the very end of the film I decided it was Kate McKinnon.

I am not a smart man.  It's actual the opening film from All the President's Men, basically. Perfect film to watch after this. Yeah, i agree with u 
The first part really confused me 
I even got difficulties in remembering the names  Agreed, The Post was very by the numbers & didn’t excite me about journalism. In contrast, I loved Spotlight & thought it was an award worthy film that excited me about the First Amendment. How dare you blaspheme *The Shape of Water*. That film is a treasure. Why did the Streep and Brie scene feel overacted? She’s talking about her husband whose dead and fear of losing the company that her father handed down. It seemed pretty appropriate [deleted] > Shape of Water

ty! now i can stop calling him round face Joaquin Phoenix eeewwwh. this isn't a great feminist movie.  ive been thinking of watching all the presidents men. is it really as good as it sounds? >  a great, feminist movie

Oh boy. I agree - the ending ties in well with the beginning of *All The President's Men*, making this movie almost like a companion piece or even prequel.  [Those are the actual tapes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHe8lYekBRM&t=50s)

edit: note that this tape that plays at the end was recorded after the Watergate break-in and the subsequent reporting, where I think the movie wants to present the tape as if it's a response to the publication of the Pentagon papers. I'm also a Social Studies teacher. I loved Lincoln and Bridge of Spies.  I doubt you're the only one, it's a very strong moment.  That scene is why you put Sara Paulson in that role - it wasn't to make sandwiches. Yeah that scene was a bit much. I think the earlier scene where she [walked through the group of women on her way up the stairs to the stock exchange to make the company public](#spoiler) worked much better for that same kind of thing. Hmm...maybe we should cast more heavyweights in the sequel...maybe Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman? Bridge of Spies is one of my favorite movies of the last decade.  Mark Rylance is brilliant in that movie. collusion

secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others I actually didn't like the cliff-hanger. The Post stood perfectly on it's own, and now there's this idea that there might be a sequel. Same here. I thought there was not much happening in it. The characters didn't get very interesting or anything. It's just like...

* There's a big secret that the paper is about to publish

* Oooh are they gonna do it or are they not

* The boss lady is talking emotional talk about how she's a woman and she wasn't expected to rise to such a high position

* They go through with publishing, yay! They win in court, how touching.


Okay. Cool story bro. Seriously, I wanted to like the movie, but now that I think of it, I actually hope I watched the new Fifty shades instead. I'm serious. Meryl Streep's monolog to her daughter in that bedroom was probably the defining scene of the movie for me. I think, if up to that point, I wasn't fully on-board with her character and her story in the movie, from then on I was.

Her overall performance wasn't amazing but I got something out of that scene and this movie that I probably knew before but hadn't really been made to feel. I think it eclipsed Michelle Williams's Gail Harris Getty in *All the Money in the World*.

I don't really get the idea either that because Kay Graham was rich/influential, that's she's somehow unfit to be the subject of a movie... I think if the character had been a man and the story basically the same about a man trying to save his family's newspaper business amidst the scandal and reveal of a government cover-up, no one would have questioned the appropriateness.

**Edit:** And I thought this movie was alright, serviceable at worst and has some pretty good scenes and directorial decisions. I think I may have liked a little more intrigue or suspense. Lmao people dislike it so it's brigaded? Really?

Maybe some people just don't like it?  Yeah it's definitely the people who worship a billionaire who are pointing out that the movie lionizes a wealthy woman who never had a job and partied with war criminals because she did the morally correct thing once. > Doesn’t overly romanticize journalism as I worried it would (other than the last couple scenes - SCOTUS and Meryl’s preachy lesson afterwards.)

i was nearly rolling my eyes at that last exchange between streep and hanks too. otherwise i agree with you on the other points and definitely enjoyed the movie more than i thought i would. seeing the climate it's been released in, i imagine it'll be well positioned for some awards. >I really hated this movie. I'm not going to say I hated this movie but...  
  
wait, wut?   > Meryl Streep is very good but can become Oscar bait-y at times.

What do people even mean when they say that! For a movie, it's arguable, but how can an actress be in ""Oscar bait-y"" mode?? What elements of the actor/character suggested as such? > Again, another film that has me convince we need an ensemble cast Oscar.
> 
> 

I've never thought of that. That would be rad as hell. I felt the other way around with that scene, it seemed very heavy handed and was one of ""slow sad scenes with piano music"" that took away from the tense pace that the movie was building. This film was at its best when it didn't get too deep into individual characters outside of the main story. I think the irony of it is if it were made in 2003 or something, it will feel fresh and be well reviewed. But thats exactly what it feels like, a movie made in 2003.  [deleted] They weren't senior lawyers. That was the point. Jesse Plemons is introduced and Hanks basically makes fun of him for being young. If you look closely the only reference I notices was a Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid movie poster. Which stared Robert Redford... Your forgetting the opening Vietnam scene. There are a few parts with people running full-speed across crowded spaces, sometimes carrying heavy packages. Tom ""Rolling my shirts sleeve"" Hanks Also over Florida Project, and over Blade Runner 2049. smh 
There's a part of me that wishes that Jesse Plemons could see this post.  No it was just for the continuation of storyline. It felt weird to me that Spielberg would give such a ""Marvel -kinda"" ending to the film. But it certainly would be a foolish choice to make ""The Post 2"" XD. They already did, it is called All the President's Men.   > parts of it were cringey af,

I can't believe they thought the Nixon guy miming in the White House window was a good idea...especially at the end when they just play the ""evil music"".  That was pretty cringey. Meh, I feel like that shot is a good example of what's wrong with the film.  Yeah Hanks and Streep are great actors, but if they're not saying anything interesting (or taking a long time to say very little), why does it matter if the camera stays like that on them?  We already know they can act.  That scene was 2x longer than it should have been, and if it was edited they could've chopped out the useless mumbling over each other (which did very little to make it realistic) and just gotten to the point quicker (who the characters are, what their relationship is, etc).

Anyways...I feel like that's the kind of logic the whole film rests on.  It keeps telling us things are important without letting us feel that way on our own, or it keeps saying ""this is interesting because Meryl Streep is talking"" and it wasn't always interesting.  The whole film could've lost 30 minutes and been a lot better for it. Your haven't watched Darkest Hour yet.

It's so Oscar baity I was taken aback when the Weinstein logo didn't show up. It might get nominated for best picture. Alison Brie needs to headline an Oscar baiter. She is a brilliant actress who gets short changed with bit roles like this. She deserves better  Why? I thought she was fantastic, especially the moment when she finally sticks up for herself when Whitford keeps talking down to her.  ""that's all women did back then and Spielberg wants us to know it.""

But if that is what women did isn't it accurate? Ehhh, I think you're way off. As a woman myself, I thought the attempt at a feminist message was thin and condescending. We're supposed to be amazed that Streep's character can eventually do her job? > Streep and Hanks have great chemistry.

They do, and I was glad that the movie didn't feel the need for some sexual tension subplot. It was nice to just have it be that they work closely together and get along easily. Very few of the complaints are about the acting, including Streep and Paulson.  I guess we will have to agree to disagree about that the writing felt natural.  They straight up monologue to hit us over the head with the message they are trying to portray.  That is lazy writing.   What do you mean when you say someone is 'electric'? It's pretty low in the mix, but I heard Dylan's ""A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall."" By cutting off the TS markers they can feign ignorance if those documents were eventually made public and they were questioned about their participation. You'd be surprised at the number of times classified material was found in personal garbage bins purely because the classification marker was still present. Remove the marking, and only those that know it is classified would know to report it. Bringing all those documents together to comb through would have been nearly impossible if there was TOP SECRET sprawled all over each document because each person that came into the room would be liable to report their existence (like the lawyers or law enforcement). He caught Nixon's goons breaking into the Watergate. It was a huge political scandal that they teased right after depicting the scandal around the Vietnam report. The security guard was calling the cops and  just said something along the lines of ""there's a break in at the watergate"" In the 6th grade I was in the emergency room with a nasty cut on my head, we were playing football and I collided with another dummy. While sitting in the waiting room there was a kid about my age with his hand up in the air. I was like, ""what's wrong"" he turned so I could see his armpit...a pencil was sticking about 3 inches out of his armpit. He was wrestling with a kid and he reached over the kids back to roll him backwards and the kid had a fully sharpened new pencil, tip up, in his back pocket. It stuck in there about 3 or 4 inches. He was afraid to pull it out and looked white as a ghost.  I thought she was good, but she was trying to play this unsure of herself, somewhat vulnerable woman, and that didn't always come off as genuine for me because I kept just seeing this very sure of herself, not very vulnerable, will probably survive the nuclear apocalypse Meryl Streep. Oh my god yes that 'stepping out of the courtroom surrounded by women' scene was pretty heavy-handed/dumb. I thought it was pretty funny. I don't think they make everyone who's against Bradlee seem like a cookie-cutter bad guy. Bradley Whitford's character, though a bit sexist, had reasonable objections, because of the immense financial risk it would put the company under. And Fritz was always treated as a good guy, but he's also against publishing the papers.  It was actually boring. Out of curiosity, what did you find amazing about their performances? I felt like they were just thrown into basic roles and played them well, but they were still basic. That is my opinion, but I am by no means a movie critic. It's basically a shot for shot remake of the All The President's Men opening. Ending with them walking through the printing plant would have been so much better. It isn't oscar bait because of its quality but because it is a period piece about how the media is awesome, two things everyone knows are catnip for the academy.   i think you don't know the meaning of oscar bait That's not what ""oscar bait"" means.  Reddit has two ways of classifying movies. Franchise action, and Oscar bait.  >	nothing long term gained from all this 

This movie wasn’t about the media’s duty to oppose the White House or tell the truth or whatever else you’ve mentioned. This movie was about the immensely difficult decision to break the law and risk everything with the hope that the Constitution would prevail. 

The movie climaxed with one of the most important Supreme Court decisions ever. The landmark decision in *New York Times Co v. United States* checked the President’s executive power, and strengthened the First Amendment. It was a huge deal, and it remains hhgely relevant todat    > They still parroted everything that GWB had to say.

Even Podesta thinks he's a dick for not toeing the party line. I cannot understand people walking out of a movie unless it's genuinely unbearable. Would you not sit through the whole thing to see how it plays out? What a waste of your money.  Why? I haven't seen the movie yet, but based on your description, that's exactly how she was described in the Warren Buffet biography. I was worried they would try to white wash her faults when I saw the trailer, but it sounds like they did a pretty good job of showing how she actually behaved. Her ""Kay parties"", as they are called in the book, were like her favorite thing to do, so that makes sense they'd have to drag her out of one. Despite all that, she did rise to the occasion and do the right thing in this story, so I think she deserves praise for that. I think that's kind of the point though. She wasn't a hardened journalist working for peanuts and ready to go to jail just because it was the right thing to do. She had lived a very comfortable life up to that point and had to make the decision to rise to the occasion, even though everyone she had trusted told her not to.

To be fair, they really did emphasize what a rich upper-class lifestyle she and the other upper management led. I couldn't get over how this was a director who created one of the greatest action sequences in the history of war films, yet the movie opened with the blandest Vietnam scene ever... He was alright.

It *is* a small role because I think the only reason I noticed him was because when I first saw him, I said, ""Is that David Cross in a hairpiece?""

He did alright with it (quiet competency is something I don't mind with famous middle-tier actors). The only reason he didn't stand out was because he wasn't given anything juicy to work with, which is fine. His character was never really meant to be a main focus, he's just part of the secondary cast. *That's my secret captain, I'm always leaking* I haven't see ATPM in a few years, but I have seen it a bunch of times in general. If I recall correctly, the opening scene with Watergate is shot almost identically to the ending of The Post. One directly leads into the other, as if Spielberg was declaring The Post as the official prequel to All The President's Men. Bizarre. It’d certainly make a great double feature.  I'm glad that I watched AtPM before seeing this.  It kinda helped me get into the mindset of the era. Yeah me too haha I chuckled when Meryl Streep said, ""Hopefully we won't have to go through all this again anytime soon."" or something like that, to Tom Hanks as they were leaving the printing press room together. Heh, try being a history nerd -and- a Marvel nerd. It’s a miracle my friends go to movies with me at all.  I think as an American you ""get"" the scene because its part of your history. But people watching this film in another country don't know the meaning of the scene; my gf certainly didn't and I had to explain to her what it meant. 

The other scene you mentioned was actually incredibly important: it marked the turning point for Hanks character, from indifference to Streeps character (or seeing her as a hindrance) to beginning to see her in a new light.  I'm absolutely sick of lose ending movies like 3 Billboards. Being on the nose is exactly what we need. 
 What do you mean by ""no one talks like that""? This post is a month old but I just saw the movie so I wanted to chime in and say Spielberg did the exact same thing with Lincoln. It should have ended with Lincoln walking out of the room and down the hall because he was going to Ford's Theater, but instead it had to do a bunch of exposition afterward about how the President had just been shot. Had to scroll down a long way to find the Mr. Show fans. I think we’re first introduced to David Cross’s character by his voice which I immediately recognized. Then I realized the older guy was Bob Odenkirk and I was like “WTF”.  [You've seen this,](https://vimeo.com/127605643) right?

*A video documenting the last day of hot metal typesetting at The New York Times. It shows the entire newspaper production process from hot-metal typesetting to creating stereo moulds to high-speed press operation.* Maybe it was Spielberg trying to show ""mansplaining"" (grandpa Steven, you are old) or trying to be balanced after an entire movie of old white men stopping Hillary, I mean, Meryl Streep, I mean, this lady that owned a newspaper from making history. yeah man.  i'm serious.  every time someone was carrying a folder of papers i was on the edge of my seat.  like literally never thought that would happen.  the first time with the kid running.  i thought he was gonna get hit by a car or something lol I just assumed the women were there for Streep's character given that era had a women's empowerment movement that coincided with the hippie movement. Or how a young idealist woman who happens to work for the opposition just happens to run into Kay Graham, have a conversation with her about what a True Inspiration she is, then immediately get berated by the Big Baddies right in front of Kay??? That scene had me cringing too, along with a couple of others. It was a great film though. Natural gas, probably. Haha exactly. That sequence was very well done Is it just me or did the movie incorporate actual recordings of Nixon? (ง’̀-‘́)ง  The main lead in is that the White House Plumbers (who carried out the Watergate burglary) were originally formed by Nixon to burglarize Daniel Ellsberg's (the leaker of the Vietnam Study) psychiatrist's office to try to find disparaging material on Ellsberg during his criminal trial.

Once it was found that the psychiatrists' was broken into and ransacked for information, the court threw out the government's case against Ellsberg.  I honestly don’t remember if he actually went through with banning the Post from the White House. If he did, it didn’t last long. 

The Watergate burglary happened in the summer of 1972, so about a year later. And then that scandal played out over the following two years, ultimately leading to Nixon’s resignation. 

Like in The Post, the Watergate story was primarily led by the Washington Post (whose reporters and editors were immortalized in All the President’s Men) and, to a lesser extent, the New York Times and Time Magazine.  The camerawork for the scene where Meryl in her study and the entire scene is physically revolving around her was awesome. It really hit home on the gravity of the situation and decision she was making.  Also, Tom Hanks. The old folk *love* their Tom Hanks films, no doubt.  [deleted] Bellevue, WA. Lincoln Square Cinemark. Crowd was a lot of fun. Not to sound like a dick but the reaction by this sub isn't that surprising. I don't think most people here really appreciate the great camerawork from Spielberg in this film  Agreed. It's not that crazy of a thought - Spotlight was an absolute masterpiece of a movie, and probably the metric by which all investigative journalism movies will be measured moving forward.  Green River > 'hopefully this doesn't happen again'

See I thought that was kind of cute and would have worked much better as the actual ending. They wouldn't know her from a fly on the wall, there aren't throngs of people cheer leading her, it's a pandering scene.  This was my biggest gripe with the movie as well.  Trust the viewer to get the point of the movie.   Made **Ready Player One** & **The Post** pretty much at the same time.

Spielberg is a machine. I mean Bridge of Spies was a very enjoyable movie watching experience.  I will probably never watch it again. did you notice the extra who was the typist for the paper when they were loading the final story?  he was hunting and pecking with his two pointers, typing b x b x b c over and over, so fake It emphasized the fact that men often interrupt women. I felt her monologue was a bit much. It was like her *womansplaining* to Tom Hanks and at the end he was like “hur dur why didn’t I see that you right.” [deleted] > Bradlee and Graham were personally very cozy with the Kennedy admin, including holdover Bob McNamara

very good point.

fact is, the movie is called 'the post,' not 'the pentagon papers.'  there's a lot of jealousy from the Times people that they didn't get a movie for them, too.  lol > Also, the movie is very clear on the Times' primary role in the scoop vs. the Post's secondary one.

Very clear, until people erroneously remember that ""the Post"" had the Pentagon Papers story. It's either CCR or Hendrix. Every time. I don’t have a problem with that lol I’m a pretty big history buff and I read WaPo often enough. 

This movie was the push I needed to start paying for a service I was unfairly using for free even though I could easily afford it. So even if it wasn’t the movie everybody wanted, it was a hell of an ad.  Not sure why you got downvoted. For the people who do not know, they actually have a user (/u/washingtonpost ) who posts comments on /r/politics. Very cool! It's also how he was credited in the OP post! 😂 To be fair, he kind of set the stage for modern directing. Pretty sure it was referring to Watergate. prob reference to the current political climate we're in right now  You think that’s bad?

I thought Allison Brie was Sally Hawkins >_>

And I thought Michael Stuhlbarg was Joaquin Phoenix <_< I'm a huge fan of GDT but The Shape of Water is probably my least favourite of his films.  I'm sorry :'(

Maybe my expectations were just too high. I’ll back him up. Really liked the film, did not love it though. 

It definitely didn’t meet my anticipation but I wouldn’t say it’s bad.  Likely but I'd be happy with any of **Three Billboards**, **Lady Bird**, or **CMBYN**. Best Picture is not likely because it failed to receive a SAG ensemble nom, which every Best Picture winner has in past 20 years. Watch it immediately. *The Post* is an adequate movie. *All the President's Men* is outstanding. 

Several years ago I showed it to my high school aged son who is more into shoot-em-ups and video games. He thought it was excellent even though it's far outside his wheelhouse. 

It's fantastically well made, written and acted and it holds up very well even decades after its release. Yes - one of my favorite movies and a really well-done movie. Hoffman and Redford are great in it. If you liked this movie, you'll definitely like All the President's Men - more intense and a lot more journalistic investigation in that one too.  > sandwich

There is something else to that. Through much of the movie, she just seems like a standard housewife: seeing Hanks off as he runs to do Big Things, raising the kids, making sandwiches. But then finally she gets that monologue. It's delivered in her own art studio, which also displays pieces that indicate great talent. It's a significant contrast to hear earlier portrayal. Yes! I actually forgot about that, but it worked well because it was very realistic, unlike the SC scene. Yeah I didn't really need that to be honest. Has the weird sequel vibe to it, and it just felt like they were trying to hammer it home that Nixon really was an asshole, jut in case we thought what he did in regards to The Post and The Times wasn't so bad.  If you read my comment you'd see I pointed out that there was a lot of valid criticism of the film and I could understand why some people didn't like it. This website has become exhausting, literally every time an opinion that isnt in line with /r/politics is presented , it **MUST** be from brigading. He already said he hated the movie. He just meant he wasn't going to say it again. Makes perfect sense.  [deleted] This, Molly's Game and Three Billboards all had casts that were at their best because they had so many people surrounding them that were also on their A game. This would allow for those smaller roles to be recognized in some fashion. I suppose. With All The President's Men, Network, Wag The Dog, Frost/Nixon, Spotlight, .... . There are too many political journalism movies which are far better than The Post.  

And I thought The Post would be more relevant than ever with all the classified leaks in recent years, and Trump not allowing media into the White House - which George W Bush didn't do (as far as I remember). Yes!  That's what I forgot.  Thank you! Given it's Spielberg, inoffensive and has a relevant message on modern media, it WILL get nominated for BP without a doubt. It'll be seen as the weakest of the bunch but it'll be in the mix. Lol, oh yes, it must be easy to assume control of a large regional newspaper after not having worked a day in your life, in a time period when it is barely becoming socially acceptable for women to work at all, let alone own and run a large business. Maybe you don't have to be amazed, but to pretend that what she was dealing with was no big deal, I would consider to be a ""thin and condescending"" critique, because you have certainly never been in a similar situation.  Every single one of Hanks' lines goes something like this:

""Oh, shit! Johnny, I need this now. What you got?""

BAD BAD BAD BAD WRITING I think they may have intended to do that & cut after ""I can't imagine we'll be doing this again"" or whatever the line is, but test audiences didn't remember that WaPo investigative work is what uncovered the Watergate scandal and so didn't get the joke THANK YOU. So frustrating reading all these posts blowing over the content of the film. Sometimes a film is just unbearable. I'd rather go do something else or something productive even if I get screwed out of $10.  I totally agree with you in theory, but I had family in town and we knew we could find something better to do. Also, MoviePass.  We ALMOST walked out. In fact, halfway through, my girl went to get popcorn and check out other movies and their start times, if there was *anything* enticing we would have left. There was obviously nothing coming up that we hadn't seen before.... I didn't even realize it was David Cross till now. I thought it was Nicholas Brendon the entire time It certainly felt that way. Like Spielberg knew that people would make the comparisons between the two stories and movies so just decided to make it a clear connection Yup — [here's the ATPM shot.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kEHZ29QUiOY/T_3sEVm-DNI/AAAAAAAAAbc/kNBGJFF9yO8/s1600/WatergateWindows_AllThePresidentsMen.jpg) Apparently, that line was ad-libbed by Meryl Streep! I was expecting her and Tom Hanks to turn to the camera and wink after that line. It was fine without needing to spell out W A T E R G A T E  It was an ""as you know"" scene inserted because the screenwriter assumed the audience was too stupid to understand the entire arc of Meryl Streep's character in the movie. 

Sarah Paulson/Mrs. Bradlee laid out the entirety of what Katharine Graham was going through, even though Ben Bradlee no doubt is just as aware of the situation intimately by now. Nobody just sets one aside and explains an entire person's evolution in a nonchalant chat.

It's the most blatant example, but certainly not the only one in the movie. Odenkirk I recognized instantly, but it took me a few seconds to figure out if that was really David Cross or not. He has really not aged well at all, he looks so different.  THIS IS SO AWESOME.  Dude, thank you.  I came here looking for mentions of the typesetting machines. Thank you! >  get hit by a car or something lol

that's because he did it twice in the span of 5 minutes.  I swear if he did it a third time I would've *wanted* him to get hit Maybe I am not remembering it correctly but the protest group was both men and women, it was just the straight line she chose down through the crowd that was homogeneous.   Was it well done??? I was disappointed all the way through. For me personally, ending with Watergate was kinda expected and monotonously done, like the entire movie

 yes, recordings Thank you for the reply! Thank you for the reply! Are you referring to the scene with everyone on different phone lines? That might've been my favorite part of the movie.  Everybody loves their Tom Hanks films Lol exact same in my theater  That’s cool. I only asked because my theater had a similar reaction, but I’m in Austin, TX so never mind ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I've seen so much 'by-the-numbers', 'generic', etc. complaints, like what did you expect? Did you want a twist ending where Nixon barges into the office with a shotgun? This sub is so obsessed with concepts and broad plot outlines that a familiar plot executed absolutely flawlessly is garbage to them. Completely agree. It just got worse in the final scene as a ""'member Watergate??"" bit You think that informed political protestors, protesting outside the United States Supreme Court, would be completely unfamiliar with one of the two key appelants in the widely publicized Supreme Court case that they are there to protest? 

What on earth would lead you to believe that these people would not know her from ""a fly on the wall""? Like the time he made Juarassic Park and Schindler's List at around the same time I don’t really know if that’s a good thing. Because both Bridge of Spies and now The Post, while competent movies, are just really average for Spielberg. And yet both are getting critical acclaim, for what I’m certainly not sure. (Though Meryl Streep truly shined in this movie) Same could be said if this movie IMO I forgot where I read this but someone called Bridge of Spies the ""moviest movie of all time"" and I laughed pretty hard because of how apt that was.

I feel just like you do - that was a perfectly competent movie and an enjoyable experience and probably won't get around to a re-watch.  > loved the scene with Streep walking down the courthouse steps and the woman (mostly young) looking up to her. Showed powerful female role model without saying a word

It's interesting to hear the perspective of a younger viewer.  It illustrates that this movie was made for a wide audience to, essentially, retell a timely civics lesson about the free press in a democracy.  A lot of people think the scene is heavy handed and obvious (as do I) and then use that to justify their opinion that the movie is a part of some agenda from the liberal hollywood to shove 'sjw' tripe in our faces.  Which is nonsense.

What did you think of the final scene?  Did you know before the movie what Watergate was and that it led to President Nixon's 'resignation'? 

 so you're holding the movie accountable for a) the beliefs of other people that b) haven't happened which c) the movie thematically, explicitly, and repeatedly deny? Or maybe The Doors Wow he posts comments! Neat! Hahaha yep, this is my new favorite thing.  otoh it's my second favorite of his after Pan's Labyrinth

that score was magical I went in with low expectations cause I'm not that much of a Del Toro fan, but Shape of the Water blew me away and sits at my #4 of the year yes, It's really irritating when people just make ad-hominem arguments. ""well, it's Meryl Streep, so her acting must be oscar baity"" - It's a Spielberg movie, so it must be oscar baity etc etc.

I think most of the directors' producers would rather want to make a movie that does well on box office instead of one that does well on academy but not financially. So that argument is flawed, to begin with.   Streep is a great actress, no one’s challenging that, I’ll never undersell her talent. She’s fantastic here! There’s just a couple of moments where I think she over cooks an emotional moment, it’s a bit unsubtle. It’s probably more Spielberg’s fault to be fair. That's a great idea. I'd nominated Lady Bird for that this year if it was possible. So many good, smaller supporting roles Yea I understand if you forgot it. Felt like a completely different movie. That wasn't originally part of the movie. Those scenes with all the typewriters in his house was actually Hanks begging the writers of *The Post* to finish the pages he was supposed to be shooting that day. [deleted] People don’t know history. Relatively few would see DNC on the window and go “ohhhh shit”. But everyone knows the word Watergate. 

I wager they tested it without the VO and found it was necessary.  I don't have a problem with that scene because it's not just for viewers but for Mr. Bradlee too who as the character in the film weren't grasping the magnitude of Graham's position. But almost the next scene where Katharine Graham is telling exactly the same thing to her daughter is a bit too much.  These comments are infuriating! How else was the movie supposed to end? You're going to make a movie in which Nixon was president and completely not even touch on Watergate? It was done tastefully and elegantly.  Of course!

But old people... [deleted] Figured. Always a cool experience when the audience gets that engaged. Spielberg doing “dual films” is basically the norm. I need to start saving my comment because I rewrite it every few months.

Bridge of Spies - The BFG

The Adventures of Tintin - War Horse (plus Lincoln less than a year later)

War of the Worlds - Munich

Minority Report - Catch Me If You Can

The Lost World - Amistad - Saving Private Ryan

Always - Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

ET - Poltergeist  Spielberg 1993 has to be up there as one of the greatest ever years for a hollywood director. The Post looks like it's losing steam in the awards race really quickly. It looks like it is just going to get nominations for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Original Score. Disagree on Bridge Of Spies. I think that movie is a bit of a secret masterpiece. If someone else had made it we'd be calling it one of the best political dramas ever made. *Bridge of Spies* is a fucking masterpiece  Bridge of Spies is *much* better than The Post. Nah I think Bridge of Spies doesn't get nearly enough credit from audiences, I skipped it in theatres because I didn't hear great things, but it's fucking fantastic IMO.  > Though Meryl Streep truly shined in this movie

So a typical Meryl Streep performance. I'm just saying it's weird to make that story the subject of this Washington Post film. What one man thinks is good another man rolls his eyes at Dear god I would hate this so much. The race for Best Actor isn't all that stacked with Oldman, Day Lewis, Chamalet seeming to be the only locks. With the allegations surfacing against Franco Tom Hanks is all the more likely to secure a nomination for Best Actor.  I think waiting this long for a wide release really hurt them. A fine and average Spielberg movie like this would probably have more momentum if it had come out own late December.    Bridge of Spies is fantastic. Definitely not seen by enough people. I still think Franco will make it on. Most of the votes had already been cast several days ago. Daniel Kaluuya is basically a lock too. It’s *very* rare for a Golden Globe, SAG, Critic’s Choice, and BAFTA nominee to miss out on an Oscar nomination. Especially since Get Out didn’t get a huge nomination haul at BAFTA but he still got in  Things are gonna get messy then. Some people are NOT going to be happy.  ",1
132,"Man. The whole movie is great, but that scene where Lady Bird finally confronts Danny about being gay and instead he just breaks down crying and she comforts him was the moment I fell in love with it. Such a 180 of where I thought that scene would go.  ""Are you and mom going to get a divorce?""

""No. We can't afford to.""

I don't know why but i thought it was the funniest joke in the whole movie. ""Some people aren't built happy."" Floored me. Half way through the movie the older couple sitting next to me had this exchange.

Man: ""I don't know what this film is about""
Woman: ""yes i agree, i'm sorry honey this was a bad choice""

At the end of the film they were both sobbing.  timothee's character Kyle had my audience in stitches with every word he said. one of my favourites of the year!  The first act kinda felt like Wes Anderson doing ""Napoleon Dynamite"", I loved it  I love that we are now getting at a point where we can have early 2000s period pieces. This movie perfectly encapsulated that time in so many scenes throughout the movie, doing it hilariously so every time.

My favorite example of it was the use of ""Crash Into Me"". It reminded me a lot of the use of ""Drops of Jupiter"" in the movie Other People. Taking a song that we've heard before and using it in a stereotypical way at first and then using it later on in the film to help get to the emotional core. It's a welcome trend for me and has changed my opinion on both of those songs.

It was also just a surprising hilarious film altogether. I was expecting it to be funny, but not nearly as funny as it actually was. The awkward scenes at the Catholic school, the way that Kyle first mentions his father's cancer, and the scene where Lady Bird's dad was just playing solitare while Lady Bird and her mom fought all had me bent over laughing.

Just a beautifully orchestrated, loving, tender film about growing up and realizing that your parents are people too. Loved everything about it. I would have watched 8 more hours of it. The scene with Lucas Hedges crying into Ronan was the best  highlight for me (in a movie full of highlights). Almost started crying myself. The Ronan/Metcalf relationship was unbelievably real & familiar.

The most laughs I've had at a theater this year (mixed in with teary-eyed moments). Just a great script, direction, performances.

Greta Gerwig can do no wrong at this point. Ronan's accent was super impressive and she jumped to number one on my Best Actress prediction so far. Chalamet's character was great, his delivery gave me a Nicolas Cage vibe for some reason (no idea why, doesn't make sense, but made me laugh a bit).

Also, what a year for Tracy Letts. The Post, Lady Bird, The Lovers. Didn't like that last one at all, but that's an impressive year.

Easily top 5 of the year, 9/10. The scene with Lady Bird and Danny outside the back of the coffee shop broke my heart. So well acted on both side. Cried my eyes out. One of the best debuts of all time.

""I'm sorry I wanted more."" When Timothee Chamelet's character said ""that's hella tight"" I was the loudest laugh in the theater. This is a beautiful movie, easily the best I've seen this year and one of my favourite coming-of-age movies period.

Every part is perfectly cast and expertly played. Ronan and Metcalf will get the Oscar attention, but the whole ensemble deserves recognition. 

The scene where Lady Bird is in Sister Sarah Joan's office and they discuss how there's no difference between love and paying attention is a perfect way to encapsulate the entire movie.

An actual 10/10. See this movie.  Lucas Hedges is absolutely killing it right now. Played a major role in three straight releases that will likely be Best Picture nominations (Manchester by the Sea, Lady Bird, Three Billboards). And an Oscar nomination for himself in there, as well.  I liked that we didn't get the cliche airport scene at the end. The Mom got there too late and that was that. That's life sometimes... Honestly was surprised by the powerful punch at the end of the film.  As a guy, I don't know what relationships are like between mother and daughter, so it was refreshing to see a film that seemed pretty authentic in it's depiction of a mother and daughter.  Loved the performances and hope it picks up a few Oscar nods so more people will see this wonderful film. Wow. Hope this gets all the recognition it deserves. Absolutely in the top three movies I've seen this year. Saorise Ronan is amazing. What a debut for Greta Gerwig.  This film is one of two things:

1. For the people who relate to it: painful, cuttingly real, upsetting, difficult, emotionally triggering to the point that someone might relive the emotional abuse of their adolescent years...

2. For the people who don't relate to it: a pretty good movie, yeah like the acting is good and stuff, interesting... Man having gone to Catholic high school, everything was just so dead on perfect. I laughed so hard at the JV coach becoming the drama teacher and they way he was still like a coach to them. Or the anarchist kid who’s still going to a private high school. So many great little touches like that.

Yeah I’ll admit it, I cried at the end. Wasn’t even expecting it, just a very perfect kind of melancholy. I also grew up in kind of a boring town but they way she talked about driving it for the first time and relating it her mom was so touching. What a perfect way to end a film.

Can we just point out we are in a quiet amazing time for teen movies this decade? Easy A, The Spectacular Now, Diary of a Teenage Girl, The Edge of Seventeen and now I think the best of them yet Lady Bird. I think we are finally having directors reflecting on the more poppy teen romances and trying to make something more grounded and honest. 

Last thing this is probably my favorite film of the year (check back with me in a week to see where I feel then) and if Saoirse and Gerwig could make do like a Before Trilogy thing and just make a film Lady Bird about Lady Bird every 10 years that would just be the best. Or at least please work together again.

Okay serious last thing but who knew the guy who wrote Bug and Killer Joe could play like the most charming, cuddly dad in movie history? As someone who was in the orbit of several people who went to Catholic high school in Sacramento in the late 90s and early 00s this movie is dead on.

The movie is near-perfect at encapsulating all the things that make Sacramento unique and the things that always annoyed you, but you didn't realize you love until you leave the city.

I loved the little bits of local character like New Hel and The American Market on 24th.

The only way it could have been more nostalgic for me is if they recreated the back patio of the True Love. Lady Bird walking to the church in New York and making that call to her mom is probably my favorite moment of 2017. The cuts between her and her mom driving though Sacramento gave me the biggest smile. Just everything about it was perfect.

Movie really is something special. So happy Greta is getting all this love, and Saoirse was amazing. Probably my fav of 2017 When I was in high school, I wanted more than anything to go to Sarah Lawrence. I wasn't so much searching-for-culture as Lady Bird was, more of a ""this is the kind of place where writers come from"" sort of a thing. By the time my senior year came by, I didn't even apply, for two reasons. One was a sudden fear of being so far from literally everyone and everything I knew. The other was the realization that my parents had not only never HEARD of application fees, but that coming up with them suddenly was genuinely a hardship. I graduated in 2007, not 2003, I went to public school and not Catholic school, and I was honestly a lot more like Julie than Lady Bird, but goddamn did this movie hit on more than a few unexpected tender spots. 

On an aside, the tears started at the climax, because, God, my mom's favorite punishment was the silent treatment. Often inflicted on the whole family, who usually honestly couldn't tell you who did what.  A lot of scenes between Lady Bird and her mother are just stories right out of my own book. It brought back bad memories and made me feel absolutely awful. I almost cried when they were in the fitting room and she asked “but do you like me?” 

My mother is exactly the same: passive aggressive and never satisfied with what I do. She also didn’t want me to go to a university far from home because she was almost obsessed with the idea of me never leaving her side, and I fought for it just like Lady Bird. And like Lady Bird, I love her and know how much she loves me but can’t help admitting that she doesn’t like me as a person and we will likely never truly understand each other. 

As the only 20 year old girl in the theatre, I felt I might be the only person who really empathized and understood Lady Bird’s entire perceptive. The old ladies around me were all kind of amused. This was an awesome movie. Having just entered Freshman year of college, it's weird now to be older than the kids going through these coming of age stories. I hope that unique stories like these continue to be relatable as I get older. Movies like these make me really not want to be a grown up.  This film was a barrage of these small moments that were relatable, sad and funny (often all at once). The scene where Christine is just begging her mother to talk to her stands out for me as absolutely heartwrenching. Saoirse perfectly captured that desperate, fearful need of a child finally experiencing a parent's withholding of attention. That scene alone I'd give her an award for, and that goes without mentioning her superb job all through the film, with great supporting performances as well. You know who I liked? The dopey dad. Just seeing him staring down at the ground, pausing his inane card game on the family Dell, while his wife and only daughter dig their heels in a particularly nasty spat, was such a memorable image. The football coach trying to direct the show was brilliant. Holy shit, 100% on RT from 146 reviews and rightfully so So, as a straight guy from a pretty accepting family I've never really known how terrifying it must be for people who need to come out. I mean, we all *know* it can be a scary thing, and for some it can be emotionally painful. 

After seeing Danny break down in tears, asking Lady Bird to not tell his parents he was gay I think I understand a little more.  Loved it. Random thoughts:

* *Rushmore* is one of my all-time favorites, and I kept drawing comparisons as I watched *Lady Bird*. Then, about halfway through, we see a Rushmore poster in her bedroom!

* Holy crap some of this stuff was achingly relatable (particularly because I went to Catholic school). The idea a lot of kids have growing up that *life is happening elsewhere*, and more than anything else they need to *get to where life is happening*. I couldn't have better summed up my outlook when I was in high school (and beyond...)

* I'm 27 and I'm *just* getting to that point where I'm beginning to realize how much I owe my parents and how much they did for me. As Lady Bird learns (in her first week of college, no less) it takes becoming an adult to appreciate the adults in your life.

* Like *Rushmore*, this is a lot more clever than meets the eye. People may need multiple viewings, but there is a lot of really subtle set-up and payoff.

* Also like *Rushmore*, it's not necessarily laugh-out-loud funny (though, I laughed a lot); it's more funny in the content-smile-on-your-face-the-whole-time sort of way. 

I don't *love* Noah Baumbach, so I wasn't sure what to expect from Gerwig, but goddamn I loved it. I enjoyed the movie a lot, I gave it an 8 in the poll, but I definitely feel underwhelmed.

Based on the comments and the reviews I've read, I expected to be completely blown away by Lady Bird.  I expected to watch a masterpiece.

Instead, what I got is a coming of age story done very well.  It's charming, it has funny moments, dramatic moments, great characters and dialogue, exceptional acting - but it's still just a normal coming of age story.  The beats were familiar enough that it was fairly predictable.

I definitely would still recommend it, but I'm a bit disappointed.  My top-line review: This was a really fantastic ""coming of age"" story, that doesn't re-write the genre, but provided some fantastic performances from Ronan, Metcalf, and Feldstein.  Beanie Feldstein really is an emerging star; her comedic timing and genuinely heartfelt interactions with Ronan were by-far the best parts of the film. The dialogue and reactions to events that happened throughout the film were so damn believable.  It truly should be seen as one of the best films of this year.

However, I also had a much stronger connection to this film beyond just the general themes of the film.  I was raised in Sacramento, and there is just SO DAMN MUCH this film gets correctly.  Whether it be the just general terminology (""The fab 40s"") or the general struggles kids growing up in Sacramento constantly deal with [(""UC Davis IS wayy too close to go to college"" - such a perfect little interaction I totally had when I was selecting which college I would attend)](#spoiler).  It just gets so much right.  I think perhaps my favorite line of dialogue was when Lady Bird was talking to Jenna about how her family house in the Fab 40s was ""their starter home"" and now they live in Granite Bay. Just too damn perfect.  Also, I will say, I am glad that Sacramento is finally starting to find a bit of it's own culture, but the line about escaping this suburban sprawl for some place with a history and culture that is unique to it's own was something I've been saying my entire childhood.  However, just like Lady Bird, I too left Sacramento for greener pastors, and decided to come back home :) There's just something special about this place.    

I know that as a stand-alone film about a girl coming of age, it's fantastic.  But I didn't think I'd see in my lifetime a film that so aptly understood Sacramento and the people here. A true love letter that understands it's strengths and flaws. 9/10. Wow, I can understand why people could feel slightly underwhelmed about the movie after all the hype and flawless reviews, but it definitely made me feel in a way no other movie has this year. The last 20 minutes were especially emotional to watch, as I have been emotionally estranged from my mother since high school. Also Saoirse Ronan has the most expressive and striking eyes! Holy hell, this movie. A pretty simple movie that was incredibly well executed. I wanted it to go on for so much longer than it did. Saoirse Ronan is a major league actress and absolutely deserves any of the accolades she ends up getting from this one. 

Laurie Metcalf was amazing too. Hell, everyone who appeared in this movie was amazing. But I'm hard-pressed to think of a movie that did a better job with the portrayal of a genuine mother-daughter relationship. It captures perfectly how frustrating that relationship can be for both the mother and the daughter while also showing how much love there is, regardless.

The fact that it was a love letter to the early 2000s was an unexpected surprise too.

10/10.

On a side note, I posted about this movie on Facebook, and my dad left a comment about the great things Lady Bird Johnson did for the country. Oh Dad. I liked pretty much everything about this except the editing. Scene transitions felt very abrupt in some places, like I was watching a series of vignettes instead of a continuous story.

I know that sounds negative, like I didn't like the movie, but I did. A lot. It was both funny and heartwarming, and I felt like it was training me to have empathy for someone that in real life I would give pretty short shrift to. It's just that I don't have a lot of insight to contribute on the positive side. One of the best movies I've ever seen. I went to a small Catholic all-girls private school growing up, and this movie was ridiculously accurate. No one's ever made a movie that showed my life and my environment so realistically as this one did. personally the mother-daughter relationship absolutely hit the mark. fighting one moment and then bonding the next. the ending also nearly brought me to tears. this film is truly special and captures the very meaning of home so beautifully and in the most poignant way. as someone dreaming of going to school far away from home i feel like i’m going to have an epiphany like lady bird did. The moment the nun asked lady bird ""isn't attention and love the same?"", Me and the dude sitting beside me cried out the same time 🤷🏻‍♂️ Saorise Ronan is the best actress going right now, such a flawless performance made to look so effortless and nuanced. Perfect. I saw this with my mom. She kept staring at me! Ugh, mooom 🙄 Best coming of age comedy I've seen in years.  Maybe my favorite in the genre full stop.  I highly recommend this movie. I would have enjoyed this movie so much more if I hadn’t seen it in a packed theater here in Sacramento. Honestly, it was like watching a movie with a crowd from 1895 who were utterly aghast that the things they saw right outside were magically appearing on the screen before them. Every single time there was a shot of a local landmark, people audibly gasped, laughed, and cheered. 

I mean, it’s cute and I’m glad they felt represented, but it made the movie feel cheap. 

Still very well written and acted, but I just couldn’t remove myself from the experience.  For the record, Kyle *did* say he was a virgin right? I swear he said that. Sister Sarah Joan: Attention is love.

*hits blunt* ""I'm not keeping a list.""

""Why not you're in high school!""

Best joke in the whole movie.  My favorite part of this movie is when Lady Bird and the nun are talking about Lady Bird's college essay, and the nun asks if Lady Bird thinks love and attention are the same thing.

I'm pretty sure that line right there is the *entire* point of the movie. The whole fucking thing connects right there, at least for me. I like to *get* something out of my movies, and that gave me something to think about long after the credits were over. 

I know a lot of these coming of age movies have really hipster characters, and that's definitely present here, but it's not jarring like it is in a lot of those movies. These could all be real people, and they act like real people. That seems like a low bar, but in the age of stuff like The Fault In Our Stars, it's really not. What I loved about this movie was how real and non-cynical it was. Most coming of age movies see the protagonist going from being an innocent child to having sex, drinking, doing tons of drugs, and becoming extremely rebellious. And sure this movie had some of this, but it also had a lot of restraint and balance that I found refreshing: Lady Bird doesn't just jump straight into bed with the first guy she meets, and even when she does get physical with her boyfriend, she tells him she isn't ready yet; she gets drunk with her friends but it's not a way to cope or act out, and her mom doesn't get mad at her for it; she goes to Catholic school and does act out against the strictness occasionally, but she still is friends with the teachers/nuns that work there and doesn't completely revoke religion when she goes to college; she fights with her mom but it's always between moments of them laughing about something and never results in her running away or taking some other drastic action; etc.

I just love that this film flies in the face of every BS standard that it's been decided a film needs to meet in order to be dramatic or entertaining, and it ends up being just as dramatic and entertaining. It's real, it's cathartic and heart-wrenching at times, but it's also optimistic and positive and I love that so much.  The movie did kind of lack urgency especially with the overall conflict(getting into a desired college/relationship with her mom). Nevertheless, I still really enjoyed the film. 

I suspect that a lot of people will be turned off by the protagonist. She's selfish, self-centered, and willing to lie or ditch her friends to be with someone. However, Christine's bluntness(which her mom shares), unpredictability, and willingness to fight for what she wants gives her charm. Her flaws give her room to develop(coming of age story after all); all of which she recognize at the end when she pours out to her mother in a very poignant scene. 

Something else I want to mention is the supporting cast. They feel a bit more realistic compared to other movies or TV shows on the CW. Julie is a normal girl instead of being a fat BFF comedic relief. You don't see any bullying stereotypes. The catholic school doesn't seem that stereotyped at all aside from the ""leave room for Jesus.""  

Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan definitely deserve honors for their performances. I also looked Larue Metcalf and realized she plays Andy's mom in Toy Story.  It was a nice little film. I can tell a lot of thought and love was put into it.

I think it was over-hyped to me though, because I left feeling a little bit of ""that was it?"". It wasn't anything groundbreaking, I've seen that story a hundred times of awkward teenager coming into herself/over-bearing mom does it out of love, etc etc.

It was a good film, though. A solid 7/10 for me. Loved the part where Lady Bird's mum asks the priest/father if he had *support* and he said no, and also please don't tell your daughter.  I appreciated how they portray the Catholic School environment as a completely ordinary and typical high school. It just felt very realistic.  For whatever reason, Hollywood frequently represents Catholic Schools as over-the-top oppressive institutions, and that’s just not true. Catholic high schools are just like any other high school, except with a religion class.  Some you couldn’t pay to go back, some it was the best years of their life and they’d pay *you* to go back. Glad I went out of my way to see this. Greta Gerwig can now add ""director"" to her resume as she slowly conquers indie cinema, and based on this, I am so on board for anything else she does behind the camera. I could feel a lot of Baumbach and even Wes Anderson in here, but this is so undeniably Gerwig to the point that Lady Bird feels like a role she herself might've played had this been made 10 years ago. Ronan is charming as hell, I could've watched hours of her doing her thing, and her scenes with Laurie Metcalf were simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking. One of the best of the year, hoping this can find some luck at the Oscars. This was my favorite Laurie Metcalf performance of all time.  I've laughed at her work many many many times- Roseanne and Big Bang Theory. But she always felt kind of stage-y and broad  to me.  Here she was just .... tired.  

I know lots of people here are hating on her, but as someone closer to Marion's age than Lady Bird's age, I can see that they are just very similar women.  Marion is not a great mom, but, she does have a wonderful connection with her daughter (starting with crying together over the Grapes of Wrath), and is a victim of abuse, and is dealing with the dad, and works basically two jobs.  And we see she is nice in general. Just not with Lady Bird, who she sees so much of herself in.  It's hard to be kind to the reflection in the mirror sometimes. [deleted] Why do I feel like the only person who wasn’t blown away by this movie? I liked the movie, not saying I didn’t. But the quirkiness and coming-of-age narrative was typical, Lady Bird was almost unlikeable, Sacramento was not part of the story outside of exposition, and the most interesting characters were supporting cast/had minimal screen time. Additionally, the moment at the end with the discarded letters should have hit harder.

Is it because it was Gerwig’s debut?  I felt like it really captured the mundanity and boringness of Northern California in the early 00's. Too many other movies stick the characters in a small town and act like it's hell on earth, as if the West Coast is so glamorous, and in reality, it's really the same with one day rolling into another, yet there's an economic disparity and all these expensive lifestyles to compare yourself to that makes it almost worse than a midwest town where everyone is equal.  [deleted] How featured is Sacramento? This movie sounds up my ally... I grew up in Sacramento and graduated in 01. I'm curious how it holds up to my own experiences.

Much like the synopsis of the character I read, I dislike this city and have always wanted to leave. I don't know if the main character ends up escaping for her dreams or what but I'm 34 and still haven't managed it. A lot of my buddies joke that it's just an open-air prison with a blackhole at the bottom. It always sucks you back. For me, family. 

I still dream my parents will open up to the idea of moving their care to Oregon (mom has several medical issues) so I can give my kids a life in the PNW, hopefully before the kids are too old to feel like our new city is ""their"" city. My brother moved his family out when his kids were entering high school. They still feel like transplants 3 years later because everyone else knows each other from back to middle/elementary. As for why I stay, I have to help my parents a lot. Seeing how my brother's ""escape"" affected them makes it hard for me to go through with it as well.  A cute, pleasant, sweet film. A good execution of a well-worn formula. But people who are acting like it's the best thing since sliced bread are nuts. First off, I loved this film. I'm late to the game since it took forever to come out in the UK but it was fantastic. Between this and Get Out for film of the year for me. I could have watched Lady Bird for another three hours easily. I thought this film was everything Boyhood was praised for, yet didn't deliver on in my opinion. One thing I found interesting was that although she was cruel, Laurie Metcalf's character was right about Lady Bird, she was selfish, and did only think about herself. The characters in her life were all going through their own personal battles, her ex dealing with his sexuality, Timothe Chalamet's character dealing with his father's cancer, her mother's abusive upbringing, her father's depression, her bestfriends weight issues and unrequired love for a teacher, her brothers post-college plateau and his girlfriend's family abandonment, Lady Bird rarely pays notice to those around her and her sympathy for them is often fleeting. That theme that everyone is fighting their own battles, but is forced to deal with them alone and hide them from a society resistant to difference or outbursts of emotion played so effectively. And despite Lady Bird's narcissim, what I found the most resonant was that this was really fine for a 17 year old, and her mother just couldn't understand that she was still a child who was allowed to be selfish and need affirmation, she was exhausted by her daughter's selfishness but Gerwig presents Lady Bird to the audience in a way that encapsulates the idea that you have to let a 17 year old be there hormonal, selfish, anxious self. Worked brilliantly.  As a middle eastern I could really see my self arguing with my father and offering to pay him all the money he kept mentioning that he paid on me. 
It was the first time I see such thing in an American movie...it felt like right.
Not so different after all.
The acting was perfect.
 Girlfriend: ""what the fuck? Who's on top their first time?"" 

Lady Bird, 1 minute later: ""Who the fuck is on top their first time?!"" 

Huh, I didn't even think twice about that. I'm super late to the party but loved this movie.  Saoirse Ronan really deserves an Oscar. Amazing. Loved the film. When Danny cried into her arms I could not help but relate SO much. Being a (mostly) closeted gay, I just completely understand everything he did. Now, I've never gone as far to date a girl but I've made out with some, one girl wanted to hang more but I knew I couldn't. And crying in Lady Bird's arms just made it so real. So, so real. 

Highly recommend this film!  I thought it was really good, no doubt it was very well done and the acting was superb. I think all of the hype around the rotten tomatoes score led me to expect more than it was. That being said I had one takeaway that I haven't experienced with any other film. In the scene where Ladybird goes over to Julia's after ditching the popular kids for Prom, Julia is crying and Ladybird asks why. I've never experienced such a morose yet concise summation of depression. Julia says ""Some people just aren't built happy"". I don't know why but that really stuck with me. Also Laurie Metcalf was absolutely phenomenal in this. I can’t say I agree with the reviews. The performances were strong and the relationships were touching; however, the story was bland and the characters themselves were all stereotypical of coming of age genre films: the gay theatre kid, the troubled musician, the best friend who’s dumped for the pretty girl at school.

As strong as the performances were, the film didn’t take any risks and as a whole felt like a movie that’s been done plenty of times before.

 I just watched it. Wasn't really sure it was going to be my cup of tea. It wasn't. Didn't hate it, but I don't 'get' the critical acclaim (like many acclaimed films, it seems, so maybe it's me). 

It was *fine*. I can't see anyone watching this and thinking ""wow, I really hated that movie"", but I can see it boring a lot of people too, especially in my male 18-25 demographic. 

There just wasn't enough going on for me. I get that it's a coming of age character study, and clearly that's been great for a lot of people.

I wasn't actually too fussed about seeing this for the reasons above, but it was 10:30pm and the list of decent 1h30m movies seems to be getting shorter and shorter :-) It did what I asked of it. Passed 90 mins before bed.

I'm going to try and watch Three Billboards tomorrow, which is probably the Oscar contender I think will be most up my street of the bunch.

&nbsp;

Just fine. 6/10. Gosh, I'm glad I watched Black Panther right after this movie because I probably couldn't have left the theater without sobbing like a bitch. The whole ""but do you like me?"" part hit too close to home, I felt like if I had a fight with my father in real life, it probably would have happened in the same fashion.

Also, knew Timothée Chalamet from Call Me By Your Name but didn't realize that he looks like a stoney version of Charlie Puth until my girl friend pointed out in this movie. In my life I have rated only a handful of movies with 10/10 rating. Lady bird is one of them, and here are the reasons.

First, I myself (28 male, Greek) was raised in a small town and had to leave it at 18, so this movie hit home so hard, I was literally sobbing for 2 hours during and after I watched it. 

1) **It was real**. I'm tired of watching all those feel-good comedy dramas, where there is a happy ending for the viewer and everything is wrapped up. This movie felt like looking through a peephole of a household in Sacramento, all of the characters were 3 dimensional, had their own background and depth. The struggling, yet loving mom, feeling sad for the family's financial status and worrying her children might feel ashamed because of it. The emotionally distant dad, that plays solitaire while a huge fight is taking place behind him, who suffers from depression, but gives all he has to his children in the best way he can. The lies Ladybird uses, to seem 'cool' to her colleagues, seems cheesy, but is quite common in that age. 

2) **It is nostalgic.** It may be even more because I was 15 in 2002, but the core values are the same. The way Gerwig has written the core relationships between mother-daughter, where in one moment they're fighting like they'll never speak again, and at the same moment they speak about casual things, like which dress to wear at the prom. Also, the way Ladybird is rebellious and trying to question everything that is given to her (basketball court scene about adoption) or religion. I have many more examples, but the feelings were nostalgic, because I remember very distinctly fighting with the same thoughts or seeing parents making selfless efforts to keep you happy, without expecting to hear 'thank you'. 

3) **Little moments.** It may sound a cliche, but the little moments in this movie take the cake for me, as they're so very true, relatable and heart-warming. 

* The scene where Ladybird is crying in the car and her mom doesn't know why, but she hugs her and comforts her.
* The scene that she tries to confront her gay ex and he is ending up crying on her shoulder, because it's hard for him to come out to his parents.
* When her mom is not speaking to her and she is crying for her attention, but still getting the silent treatment. 
* The emotionally shut dad, who never expresses his feelings, but who gets hurt from leaving Ladybird one block away from her school 
* The final scene, where she's driving for the first time in Sacramento and wants to share this moment with her mom and her mom has already had the exact same thought. This for me captures the spirit of this relationship, the - sometimes - overwhelming struggle of a mom to protect her child and deter her from having the same bad experiences that she had had. 

4) **Performances**. Oh my god, the casting was excellent and the deliveries of Saoirse Ronan(Ladybird), Laurie Metcalf(Mom), Tracy Letts(Dad) are absolutely stunning. Their delivery feels so natural, that it really made me re-watch scenes 2-3 times and admire their geniusness. I've seen Laurie Metcalf in Horace and Pete as well, delivering a mind-blowing monologue. I feel if they were in not such a great movie year (seriously 2018 was an amazing year for movies), they would have gotten both Oscars. 

5) **Aesthetics**. Last but no least, the photography and the location of the movie were stunning to watch, also the colors, the soundtrack was beautiful. Not to mention Saoirse Ronan's natural beauty, which Gerwig herself complimented (something in the lines of I'd prefer to show her face for the whole movie or something) [link to article anyone?]

So all in all, if you are someone who enjoys watching action and super-hero movies, probably you didn't get the hype behind this masterpiece. If you expected this to be a movie where 'something happens' and there is start, middle-part, end sequence, you watched the wrong movie. This is a realistic, nostalgic drama, and if you ask me movies should be made more like this, than everyone expecting something to happen or a happy-end or anything. I can't wait to see Greta Gerwig's next projects.

It also reminded me of a saying about standing ovation: When the moment comes for a standing ovation, and you have a doubt about it, whether to stand-up, if you'll be the only one standing etc. it's not the right moment for it. The right moment for a standing ovation, is you can't wait for it to finish, to jump on your feet and clap with all your strength. 

This movie made me re-think all the 10/10 ratings I gave, cause I wanted to give it 11.  Absolutely wonderful. As someone who was an 18-year-old girl in 2003/2004 in a town I hated with a mom I didn't get along with, this hit close to the heart. Christine is such a well-developed character, flawed but relatable. Saorsie Ronan gave my favorite performance of the year. Lucas hedges and Laurie metcalfe are wonderful as well. 

I've been a fan of Gerwig's for years and am thrilled to see such a clean directorial transition. This feels like an artists singular, personal vision. Even my partner who dislikes coming-of-age stories liked this movie. This was probably one of the ""realest"" and ""everyday"" films I've seen. Things are brought up but not explored, e.g. Danny's sexuality or Christine's dad's depression. But the film feels so, I don't know how to say, ""textured"" that it all felt natural. Nothing felt manipulated or forced.

The editing of this film is also brilliant. It felt so tight. The film felt dense. I thought I watched a longer film (which would usually be something bad). I’m really late on this, but having just started college, Lady Bird was one of the most relatable films I’ve ever seen. The relationship between Christine and her mother, how they bond so well one minute and argue the next, it is parallel to the relationship with my mother. I teared up a few times throughout the film but I start sobbing pretty hard when Christine begs her mother to talk to her. That scene had my sleeves drenched in my tears because I can personally relate and I know the feeling that Christine felt. It’s truly a good coming-of-age film, and to daughters/children who have close relationships with their mothers it probably got them tearing up too.
 [deleted] I loved this so, so much. I’ve never related to a character more. I’m also seventeen in my final year and applying to universities out of town, and I have a (slightly more positive) similar relationship with my mother, and a loving but quietly depressed father, and even one of my best friends reminds me a lot of Julie. Oh, and I definitely had a crush on someone who turned out to be an absolute “I don’t believe in the economy” Kyle. 

I saw a lot of myself in Lady Bird, and especially bad qualities - her selfishness and ignorance at times, although it’s never, I believe, mean spirited but simply from a place of longing and hope and ambition and passion. And a love/hate (mainly hate!) relationship with her town. 

I didn’t cry during the movie or even afterwards, but about an hour later I sort of realised what I just saw and started sobbing. I feel so grateful to have this film in my life. I appreciate my mum a lot more.  I loved it. I wanted to see more and I almost didn't want it to end because Lady bird, to me, is such a lovable character. If you weren't a perfect child and you can handle sitting through some awkwardness together, take your mom to see this. You won't have to speak a single word but she'll get the message and it will mean the world to her. I honestly don’t get all the hype for this movie. It was good, but it didn’t blow me away or anything. Typical coming-of-age fare. You know all the tropes, such as:  girl ditches her long-time best friend so she can get in with the “cool kids” only to eventually find that the cool kids are actually lame. Girl loses her virginity against mother’s advice and surprise, it’s horrible, regrettable sex. Girl couldn’t wait to move to the glamorous and exciting big city, then misses home. And the whole call me lady bird thing just seemed ridiculous (I get what it’s supposed to say about her character... it just seemed... dumb, and I couldn’t imagine anyone in my high school doing such a thing). I don’t know. Laurie Metcalf was good. Maybe I’m judging it harshly because I saw the Killing of a Sacred Deer the day before, which I loved, and I just have dark weird taste in movies. I feel like a lot of people in this thread and elsewhere are responding more to the hype around the movie than they are the actual movie which is sad, because I really don't think it's fair to a movie like this. I wish I had this movie in high school. The real joy of this movie is what it didn't do. There are so many ways these types movies can go wrong and this movie avoided them all. The balance they find is just remarkable and deserves to be celebrated.

That being said, it's not a movie for everybody. It's a movie of moments. So there is no real strong narrative pull demanding your attention. Within these moments you can find the humor, the humanity and the truths that speak to you. It doesn't beat you over the head with it. 

It's this incredible balancing act and trust in the audience to discern for themselves what makes the movie so lauded by critics. I think people are going to miss that and expect something more.
 Greta Gerwig has proven that an effective coming of age story can be told in a short duration. Brilliant screenplay. I cant wait for her upcoming projects. Finally saw this. Late to the party. Yada yada. It was a pretty good movie. Great acting, solid script. The one thing I felt was really lacking though was the direction... nearly every shot was on a tripod. Just felt like a standard movie, nothing about the directing felt particularly good to me. I know, not all brilliant direction is tracking or moving shots. But usually Best Directors are nominated on their creative use of shots. None of the shots felt Oscar quality to me.

That said, pretty good movie. Definitely feel it's overrated, or maybe just not for me. Felt very disjointed and it was hard to get an emotional attachment when the story jumped around so much.  Saw it today and it's very good. However, it hit me really hard with nostalgia and sadness because I went to a Catholic high school right around that time and Lady Bird reminded me so much of my best friend (though she was cooler). So it made me miss her, and that made me sad. 

I do kind of wish the guy who says ""I won't touch your boobs because I respect you and love you"" doesn't always turn out to be gay in movies. It's like guys are all dicks or gay. And not everyone in theater is gay! But what happened in the film was still believable and done well.

It's extremely realistic and well-made. But it hit so close to home for me that it made me uncomfortable. It's tough to make a new ""coming-of-age"" thing without treading familiar ground, but Lady Bird always feels like an authentic self and not derivative. Fuckin amazing. So expertly navigates all of its themes and characters with the subtle interactions and writing. Covered *so much* in just an hour and a half, and coming out of it I felt like I had lived this full year of her life through memories. And it's not even like this particularly should be relatable to me. Where are you from? Sacramento.  Sorry where? San Francisco - being from SF, this killed me haha. [deleted] I enjoy the whole movie and even though I am a dude from Asia, I can relate to almost every character. That's great writing skills.

The movie's heart-warming and three dimensional, but that's about it. A solid film that I will probably forget in months but I will stop and watch it again if I have the chance. I liked this movie. It wasn't too excitable, but very realistic. I attended a catholic school and it was very relatable to me.  Can someone please tell me what makes this movie so great? Because I fail to see it somehow. It felt pretty generic and left a lot of subplots hanging. Metcalf's character has underdeveloped, Lady Bird herself was uninteresting, the comedy was mild, and the drama felt forced. Not a bad movie, but not among the best of 2017.  Can I just say that Kyle (Timothee Chalamet) as a douche-bag tortured soul tumblr boy is an archetype that is SO very real and present in our preteen society. What he says to Ladybird, along the lines of- ""I don't believe in money anymore.. I prefer to barter."" I can promise you I've heard words from boys like him nearly parallel to this. We must protect our preteen sisters from these narcissitic aloof self-proclaimed intellectuals at all costs. I had never seen so much as a trailer for this, but I have moviepass and I saw the review scores were consistently phenomenal. 

The writing was good, Saoirse's performance was excellent, and I was entertained throughout.  It is a very sincere film, and sincerity is always welcome when films are so damn cynical.  Saorise Ronan carries the film on her shoulders (like a good lead would)  and elevates what is otherwise very schmaltzy material.  Seriously, she’s great.

I will admit to being a structure snob before I say that the film ended three times.  I thought it was a story about [accepting and learning to love one’s mediocrity.  Then she gets accepted at her school.  So, it’s about how growing up hurts.  I guess.](#spoiler)

It seems very autobiographical, and if it is, that makes it less impressive than it could be.  Anyone can tell their own story.  Either way, Greta told it very well.  Liked it enough to watch, but not enough to own. If any of you live in Sacramento please do yourself a favor and watch this in Tower theater.  I saw the movie a couple of days ago and oh my god just thinking of the scene where Lucas Hedges cries behind the coffee shop makes me tear up. Such an amazing movie. Just saw the movie. I really enjoyed the movie but I couldn't tell  you why if you  asked me, so I'm writing a long post trying to get my thoughts down as to why I did enjoy it. I haven't watched anything like Lady Bird before so it was an intresting experience. There were funny scenes, sad scenes, scenes I could relate to and others not so much. I thought  the father character was hilarious, seems like such a stand up guy who loved his daughter, dispite the many hardships he was going through. The mother character seemed like a hard ass at first, especially with her comments such as ""you'll never get a job good enough"", but it made a little more sense when she told Lady Bird about her own mother. I could write a lot about all the characters (Kyle was funny although shallow, I felt bad for Danny because he seemed to lost when talking to Lady Bird about his sexuality, Julie was a great friend who seemed to be facing issues of her own that were not covered in the film unless i wasn't paying close enough attention) I'm on mobile so I'll just skip right to Christine ""Lady Bird"". Having graduated high school only 5 years ago, I felt like I could relate to a few things that Lady Bird went through. She seemed to have created unreal expectations in her own mind and was disappointed when they didn't live up to her own self-generated hype (losing her virginity, New York). She was trying to set herself apart from the rest by giving herself that nickname, but maybe trying a little too hard, something I did my senior year (trying too hard) lol. The ending seemed odd at first but after some thought I really liked it. Christine obviously matured (maybe just a little but none the less) when she realised what her family has done for her and how much she did love her hometown. My favorite quote in the movie was when Lady Bird was talking with the sister in her office ""Don't you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention?"" I guess why I liked it is because it felt real. Except for the portrayal of some of the high school parts, it felt very realistic that these are experiences someone in the modern day would be able to relate to. Heartwarming movie, I enjoyed the dialogue, and it kept me thinking a while after the movie was over.   I just finished watching this movie. I loved the movie. It felt very real and relatable to me. I also loved the fact that it wasn't too overdramatic and it was a simple movie overall, but I don't get the hype. I guess I just expected too much from it since everything was raving about the movie.  Just saw it. It was ok. Well acted and held my interest but it suffers from what a lot of directorial debuts do: the narrative isn't all that smooth and there are sudden cuts to another scene. It also had an overly simplistic plot, rife with clichés and characters with storylines that don't go anywhere (the father's depression or her gay ex-bf for example). Not one I see myself watching again. I'd give it a 6. Did this film remind anyone else of Boyhood except condensed into a little over a year instead of 12? Both are exceptional. Little personal, but having just moved far away from my family of which I have an at times difficult relationship with my mum, the ending really hit home. Cried like a baby, not gonna lie. Loved every minute of this to a point where I was actively not wanting it to end. There are dozens of coming of age stories every year, but this rises to the top with it's sincerity.  Enjoyed it, but stunned at how effusive the critical praise is. This was a 7-7.5 for me. Great acting, solid writing and direction, but nothing hugely noteworthy, and it wouldn't be in my top 20 or 30 films of the year.

It felt like the film was going to stay subversive and satirical to the end by having Lady Bird not get into the good school, but in the end it kinda deferred to the same sentimental coming of age tropes I was hoping it would avoid.

It was less hipster-bait than I was expecting, which was nice. Halfway through the movie is when it really kicked in for me. There are so many things touched on that while watching it it took me back to when I went through something similar during that period and damn it got me really emotionally invested by the end. It's a gradual buildup that you don't even notice until after you're all in.  Gotta say, Frances Ha had a more emotional and melancholic impact on me. But it's unfair of me to compare those two films:

What I find interesting the most is that the success of Lady Bird has come from its authentic and accurate yet truthful and frank depiction of emotional development in one's life; something always present in previous films Greta Gerwig had starred in. The stark illustration of emotional vulnerability and insecurity is something so present in her performances yet as a director you can entirely feel her presence and mark left upon the film. It's a beautiful and yet melancholic touch Gerwig leaves upon her works.

Saoirse Ronan is **beautiful** in this film. She is emulative of the anxieties and insecurities I have seen in almost every person I've known in my life and myself. 

In fact indie and mumblecore films (Namely Frances Ha) I find have such an honest emotional depiction that I find it hard to give a decisive judgement and opinion towards, because to me it's something incredibly **relatable**. I don't see it as something dramatic, I see it as something incredibly realistic - almost as if it were shot fly-on-the-wall - and in turn personal. It's not, ""someone was in a car crash"", or ""he lost his parents"", or even ""his parents got a divorce"", it's just the small things to people that are big things to them. It's so truthfully personal that I feel like I can't rate it, because it's something so familiar.  I enjoyed Lady Bird. As someone who did graduate around the time of the film. I felt nostaligic at the fashion and pre social media of teenage life. A solid 7/10 for me Loved this movie. If you grew-up in a household like this, it will resonate with you. It was cathartic for me, absolutely. 

A lot of comments here state they don't like the titular character, and that's fine. I understand. Seventeen-year-olds are developmentally a bit narcissistic at their age naturally. Now add in a mother who doesn't even like you, ignores you, insults you, won't respect your privacy, and will not support your ambitions and it's grounds for a fight for a better life regardless of how selfish it looks to anyone on the outside. After the movie was over, a daughter and mother in front of me were heading out to leave. As the mother walked away, the daughter said “wait mom, come back” and the daughter gave her mom a huge hug and said “I love you so much”. I immediately started crying. 

Edit: spelling  [deleted] Is Larry Bird in this movie?  I think this movie took the top spot away from A Ghost Story as my favorite film of 2017! Absolutely amazing performances from everyone, and this may be the greatest directorial debut of all time.  is the brother supposed to be adopted? or a half brother? they only time I remember them bringing up him not being white (when lady bird and the parents clearly are) is when they talk about how he got into Berkley? Also do we know if the brother got the job the dad was interviewing for?  Loved it. Scene was kinda cheesy but I started crying during the car scene where they are going to the Prom with ""crash into me"" playing. Made me think about a close friend I lost out of touch with after high school.  Late to the party. 
I really enjoyed the film. Many of you are saying you don't understand the bitterness of the mom to the daughter or that relationship. I have seen this sort of relationship with some of my friends and their mothers, so that resonated with me. 

My question is what was the purpose of showing the characters watching the war clips on the news? 
Was it just for the setting, or is there something more there that I'm missing? It’s a lovely film, but I found it a bit overrated (fucking hype!). Its biggest merit is how it handled the mother-daughter relationship: every scene with the two characters is beautifully written and that’s where Gerwig’s screenplay really reaches a level of true insight - just pure, genuine and relatable human emotion. It’s wonderful that Laurie Metcalf is getting recognised by this role. She is playing a real character with none of the gimmicks and histrionics we usually see on performances considered “award-worthy”. To me, she is the true star of this picture. Ronan is also terrific, but she is more vulnerable to the script’s inconsistencies - particularly in the school scenes, where most of the characters are broad stereotypes and build around ‘quirks’ (as a result, some of the sequences that rely on humor are kind of a miss, like they didn’t really get the tone of the joke). I appreciate the film’s rhythm and its moments of sensibility, but didn’t find it so insightful or special enough to set itself apart from the genre's best.
 When I first saw the trailer, I had no interest in it. I haven't liked many of Gerwig's movies and didn't care to see her direct/write a moody teenager who think's she's better than everyone. But with all of the praise it got, I figured I'd still see it. Wow. So much better than I was expecting, even with all the hype. I think it kind of had a lot of coming of age cliche'd points, but did them in such a realistic way that they felt fresh. Also, great editing. I'm really happy for Lucas Hedges as he's been crushing it these past few years. Just a really great movie! ""I don't *own* a tracking device!""

Laughed so hard at that. She's so innocent. I found it a bit long, and the short chapter in New York unnecessary or at least not executed effectively enough, but overall I enjoyed the movie. The airport scene destroyed me. I think the hype may have inflated my expectations on this one. I've heard praise saying that it's so specific in all the details & moments it captures that it manages to be a universal experience, but there was very little in the film I really connected with or found emotionally affecting... or haven't seen done elsewhere. That feels like an unfair criticism because it was a well made film with some good performances. I'm glad it's out there and connecting with so many people, but it didn't really land for me.

I wonder how well it translates for other people outside the US. So, as a 22-year-old who almost exclusively watches scifi and fantasy, I tried this; and it's awesome.

It cleared away from the movie clichés and definitely was realistic.


edit: Also, there were moments where I've almost cried lol. I really enjoyed Lady Bird. I was meaning to see it opening day but got caught up with work, so having seeing the initial wave of amazing feedback, I had quite high expectations. The plot is very simple and movie in general is predictable, but I thought it was executed perfectly. Even though not everyone might be able to relate to the main character - having a very controlling mother, money woes, and school drama - it's easy to resonate with the complex relationships between the characters. I thought that between between Lady Bird and her mum was just so amazing and made the movie. The movie not only made me feel nostalgic, but made me rethink my current life too. Saoirse was wonderful in the role, I really look forward to her future works. This is not to knock the film too much, but I was a little let down. I guess the 100% and average RT rating set my expectations far too high. Someone else also told me that it was better than BR 2049 so that didn't help either. I enjoyed it, thought it was very well made, and always felt genuine. I thought it was a good film, but not as great as it was hyped up to be.  Saw it last night and I would say I did like it. It really hit home with that post 9/11 teenaged years, from the music to the attitude and talks about terrorism. It was charming, funny and nostalgic.

However it did feel overacted at some parts. It felt like I was watching a play where Lady Bird was trying to reach the audience in the back row and it kinda took me out of it. But overall she did a solid job.

In my opinion it's a very solid 7/10 I went to Catholic school my whole childhood and I went to Catholic high school in the 2000s in Texas, not Sacramento, but nevertheless this captured that experience *perfectly* and I was in tears throughout. A+ 10/10 will watch many times alongside Rushmore for that private school nostalgia. Saw it today. Definitely the *best* movie I've seen all year. But not my personal favorite. I wonder why they picked 2002 to set the film in. I was 13 when 9/11 happened, and maybe being that much younger didn't give me the anxiety it might have given older kids. But they were really heavy on what I'd assume was the post 9/11 feel. All the war on TV, tracking devices in phones, terrorism in general. 

I feel like this will be among the coming of age classics. All the performances and emotions felt sincere.  Good film. I feel like it was missing a third act, though, or at least most of one. I've felt this way coming out of most of the indie-ish films I've seen recently, maybe it's just me. 

Great performances by Ronan and the mom, also. I was really struck by the editing. Very snappy, and effective. Most films of this type - think “Garden State” - would be edited in a more languid “give the scene room to breathe” sort of fashion. This film didn’t. One thing after another. 

And it helped set the mood really well. The lead character is an immature person, so the editing was sort of like having a teenager’s attention span. 
 It's a great movie overall, it's a story we've seen a million times but the execution is amazing, and the film is pretty realistic in its portrayal of the changes that a person suffers at that age.

Ronan and the actress that plays the mom did a really great job.

It's a charming movie. I watched it, it put a smile on my face for almost 90 minutes and I left feeling like a happier person. What more can you ask for? What a wonderful and realistic movie. The little things that you think are life-engulfing but aren't; the larger worries you don't know about that your mom stands in front of so you don't have to give it any thought; the angst you have towards yourself in relation to others; and just learning about individuality. Way to go, Gerwig! It's a lovely film. It was refreshing (at least for me) to watch a non-hollywoodized coming of age story. Well, it did play with some stereotypes, but at the end you could see that everyone is human and not just ""the rebellious teenager"", ""the horrible mom"" or ""the happy dad"".
As a teenager living in a small place, I could relate to some of the feelings expressed in the film, but I guess it didn't hit 10/10 because I'm not American neither live in 2002 (just born) and things are a bit different. I recommend it. Honestly I do enjoy films like this more than Justice League. I'd say the individual scenes in the movie are good, the writing is good, the characters are good, and the actors are fantastic, but it didn't feel like this was a story. Like, we're just seeing a moment in this person's life, but it wasn't much more than that. While that's obviously a reflection on life, the movie just felt like it was incomplete, like it didn't really have much of a goal in the storytelling. There were hints of some things I felt could have been expanded on to make for a better story, but ultimately it just didn't feel complete to me. I felt like The Meyerowitz Stories had a similar problem, although I liked this one better. It seems like a lot of people are saying this is overrated, and I tend to agree. I guess that's the problem with RT's binary fresh/rotten review system. I'm willing to bet a lot of the reviewers RT counted were, like me, charmed by this movie and thought it was solid, but not groundbreaking. With that being said, Gerwig has an impressive handle on the tone she wants to convey during this film from its first scene to its last, which is rare for a directorial debut. Saoirse Ronan is absolutely brilliant and Timothee Chalamet was hilarious. Great to see a young cast clicking so well together. I definitely thought it was good but it didn't stick with me in the way that my favorites from this year (The Florida Project, The Big Sick, Blade Runner 2049) did. I'd for sure go see it again though. I'd just have to prepare to have that Dave Matthews Band song stuck in my head for a week... Awesome acting and writing! This movie evokes different emotions from viewers, depending on their family life. The mother-daughter relationship/coming of age story was realistic, passionate, and quirky enough to keep my interest for an entire feature. Lady Bird’s characters, themes, motifs, and witty humor coalesce into an beautifully concocted third act! I shed a single tear in the final scene, and her mother circling around at the airport had me close to tearing up. It’s a clever emotional roller coaster, in the same vein as The Big Sick 2017. 8.6/10! Just saw it. It is definitely one of the best coming of age films I've seen in a recent while and one of the best comedies of this year (given its not really meant to be a comedy). Saoirse Ronan was fantastic as the lead and so was Laurie Metcalf as the mom (I literally kept thinking Sheldon's mom the entire time). I think Metcalf could potentially get a best supporting actress nod for this. The movie felt like clips of teenage moments at times instead of an overarching plot but it worked perfectly. I also liked the fact that it wasn't a ridiculously long movie. Highly recommend.  This is in my Top 5 favorite movies now. Saoirse is one of my favorite actresses so it only makes it right. I relate so much to it; difficulties with parents and financial life, coming of age, not knowing what you want to do or who you want to be. I definitely feel for Christine's desire to experience life elsewhere in the world. The cinematography, the contrasts between characters. Everything was so delightful. 

There's so many little subtle things, like even little things like a mural she was standing next to that had what looked to be a peacock and a woman, signifying 'Lady Bird'. Christine's troubled thoughts of who she is really hit me because I think it's a way of thinking that a lot of young adults go through, wondering whether or not you can be better than you are now or if you'll stay dormant in whatever life you're living in.

10/10 in my books. Can anybody recommend movies of this type of style/humor/topic? Loved this film. Did anyone else see it almost like a prequel to *Francis Ha*? I felt there were a lot of things that this film foreshadowed but never paid off. Like we never see BF#1 confront his parents about his sexually, or why/what the priest asked Lady Bird’s Mom to not tell her, or why LD’s friend was crying on prom night, etc. The only possible answer I can get is that the director chose to leave things opened ended because being a high schooler, you don’t always get to know why things happen, or care, they just happen and are never fully answered. However I feel like Greta had answers for these scenes but they were left on the cutting room floor.

 Near the end of the movie  [after Christine wakes up from passing out drunk, there was a small child with a bandage over one eye staring at Christine.  The two hold eye contact for some time.](#spoiler) What was the meaning of this scene? They played ""Tha Crossroads"" at a school dance scene, love this shit. I saw the movie a while back and I was pretty damn excited to see it.

It wasn't that great at all. It was okay but it really just felt like a more boring Napolean Dynamite without the payoff.

The movie opened up a lot of interesting subplots and then never followed up on a single one of them. It tried so hard to be bland that anything interesting they tried to understate. 

The scenes with Ladybird and her mom, as well as Ladybird and the nun teacher/principal: those were all good. We didn't get much of those.

I was disappointed. This movie was truly amazing. Probably the best representation of teenage life in a movie I've ever seen because it doesn't way over dramatize certain aspects like a traditional teenage comedy would. I was a bit emotionally drained at the end, but the journey the movie takes you on is worth it. I avoided this movie because I thought it was going to be another, ""Juno."" I finally watched it tonight and it wasn't pretentious at all. It was amazing and people who have mom's like that will be able to relate even more.  I really enjoyed this film. It managed to capture the awkward and moodiness if teenagers but also do things in such a way you still side with them at times. It manages to make both positions understandable in a way so that no one is truly 100% right at a given moment.

 It was also actually funny and comedic. The jokes hit well throughout and they never felt forced. It found that right blend between emotion and drama.

 As such I'd give this film a solid 10/10 in my experience. 

 Also Kyle was just a barral of laughs anytime he showed up on screen I would describe it as a 'pleasant' movie going experience... but not exactly so wonderful as others have been saying.  The acting was solid and the relationship between Lady bird and her mom was the most moving part for me.  I see a bit of a backlash has started here, but just wanted to say that as someone who doesn't fit into the target demographic (as some here would say) - I thought it was great. 

Nothing ground-breaking for the genre, but extremely solid and deserving of all the praise. I was surprised at how funny it was, and how much I connected to the location despite being from the UK. I guess I saw a little of my own town there and connected it to my reevualuation and similar feelings of longing once I left for uni. 

I'm a little annoyed that the BAFTAs saw fit to omit this and Blade Runner, just to include Dunkirk and Darkest Hour. Blatantly obvious why yet disappointing nevertheless. Can someone elaborate as to what Jules meant when she said that some people aren't built happy? Everyone seems to be saying that this scene floored them but it felt mostly empty to me since we don't really know all that much about her and what issues/problems she has? Is she just being a typical teenager who is sad cause she's overweight and not part of the ""cool"" crowd? Or did I just miss something major about her character? I thought Lady Bird was very refreshing. The actors seemed like real life people, and the dialogue/situations realistic. I related to MANY things in the film. 

If I had to say anything negative, is that I don't see the big hype over Ronan. She's a solid actress for sure, but didn't connect with her as other actresses in similar roles, like Winona Ryder, Brittany Murphy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Lola Kirke, or even Greta Gerwig herself. I actually thought ""Julie"" the friend was more engaging. 

Besides that, I am thrilled that Greta is making movies like this. There are hardly any female filmmakers in her age group, so it's rare we see that POV in movies. Hope she keeps going!!!

 I personally just watched this movie ( a little late I know)

And the biggest thing I felt was this film had a Boyhood feel to it.We see Lady bird (Christine) fumble her way through life and try to piece her life together. In the end shes probably better off then she was to start but still on the journey of life.

Liked the film, thought it was good, but I think it lacks the punch for me personally to mark it as one of the greats The scene in lady bird where Kyle pulls on Jenna‘s ponytail means that they had sex right? It was a fun dramedy. I'm a late 20s male but still found it watchable. Bit predictable? for sure. The gay boyfriend, the asshole cool group, the best friend reunion for prom. But just because it is predictable doesn't mean it isn't realistic. I found it well done, and very nostalgic. The strongest aspect of this movie is the cast; Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf , Lucas Hedges, Tracy Letts, Beanie Feldstein were all really well casted.

Her father and the adopted brother's gf may have been my favourite characters overall. The mom, although passive aggressive, was a good mother at the end of the day. My mom was a lot like her. I always thought that was more because we came to Canada as refugees and she grew up in a different culture/time. I wouldn't say she was as 'evil' or 'abusive' as others have on here. In fact, I sort of was on her side as the movie went on. Basically just the regular battle between generations. To be truly abusive, I need some alcohol/drug abuse, some physical violence, some actual malevolence, not a mother who takes her daughter shopping, sews her prom dress, etc.  

Overall it isn't some kind of generational masterpiece, but to me, it was a nice look into someone's life, and a solid 7/10. Basically you're a fly on the wall of a teenager going through struggles and ascending into adulthood. Sort of reminded me of Edge of Seventeen and Boyhood.  I honestly don't understand how people watch this movie and not feel emotionally attacked. This movie has lots of relatable and heart-warming quotes that are really useful in our daily lives. Even if you can't relate with the character of Lady Bird, this movie will make you feel something if you really try to understand what she is going through. A solid 10/10, one of the best feel good movies, or generally one of the best movies i have ever seen. Greta Gerwig is such an insipration

Edit: im super late for this thread Such a beautiful movie and one of my favorites. Lucas hedges is having a great year. The guy who played Kyle is gonna be in Call me by your name is only getting started. Laurie Metcalf was phenomenal and hopefully gets a best supporting actress nomination. Everyone did such a great job and I was in tears from laughing and crying. Just a very spot on and realistic movie. Tugs on your heart strings.  Quick question that my mom and I are trying to figure out:

Why did that light-skinned black preacher quit? The one that directed the first play. He is later seen at psych hospital talking to the main character's mom. What was wrong with him? What a lovely lovely lovely lovely film. Ahhh I enjoyed that so much. Real life on screen. Lovely. The movie was a nice, modern coming of age movie, don’t get me wrong. The non-ending of it didn’t even really bug me. The lack of any background to the story is what really bothered me. Why is Ladybirds relationship with her mother so difficult? Is there a past that made it this way with them or is it just “her mother was an alcoholic” and we leave it at that? They could’ve just had some kind of short scene with the parents talking about it or something.  Also where did Ladybirds brother Miguel come from?! At least one of the parents isn’t his, or else he’s adopted. But I need to know??? Regardless, it was a cute movie, I’d give it a 7/10. liked this movie. realistic, simple, sweet. a great watch. loved it.  im a 30 year old dude and related more with this movie than the snorefest that was Boyhood I thought this was fantastic, one of my favorites of the year. And I kinda wrote it off as being another one of those quirky teen indie flicks, but instead of pissing me off by trying too hard, this film was just flat out endearing. And I can certainly relate to the middle class struggles while growing up surrounded by rich folks.

Also, Lucas Hedges is just great. That's two years in a row now where he's cried in films and almost brought me to tears which is rare. He does a lot with a little in this film after a stellar performance in Manchester by the Sea. This kid is going places for sure. I thought this movie was good, but as someone who lives in Davis (and is proud to be getting my graduate degree from UC Davis) I was sort of offended by all of the Sacramento-trashing.  In fact, it always bugs me when people complain about how terrible their hometowns are.  I mean, come on, Sacramento is the freaking capital of California and you're complaining about how boring and ""culture-less"" it is?  It made Lady Bird come off as selfish, which may have been the purpose, but it still annoyed me. Probably one of the first films I've seen where it could have been an hour longer and I would have been okay with that. I can't remember the last time I've cared so much about fictional characters. I almost hate this movie because of how good it was. 

The funny parts didn't feel forced, the sad parts were genuine, the stories felt real. 

The one thing that confused me a little bit was [her relationship with Lucas Hedges. What were his motivations when they started dating? Did he really mean all the things he said about Lady Bird? Did he know he was gay the whole time? Or was that bathroom scene just a spontaneous makeout session after the play?](#spoiler)
  One thing I think I missed. What was going on with Father Leviatch (the priest who directed the first play and won the crying game)? When he was with Lady Bird's mom, he was talking to her about something and it was never explored later. What was going on there? Was he sick? I was fairly underwhelmed by this movie based on the hype and oscar noms. I definitely enjoyed the watch and loved the lead character. Great acting. Dont see it getting a lot of wins though. It is just out classed by most of the movies it is up against. Definitely not making my top 5 of 2017. This was the best movie from 2017 that I didn't like. The script is great, characters and performances are on point, editing and pacing is perfect. I just didn't care for the subject material, and the mother character reminds me too much of my own mother, which hurt the film for me, but that's not really a fault with the film.

I give it a 7/10. It's definitely one of my favorite movies of the year. My only issue is with Julie's character. I felt it was way underdeveloped and not very different to an archetype I'm having trouble identifying. I know, I probably shouldn't be criticizing the writing for a certain character when I'm not one hundred percent sure *why* I don't like it but hasn't her character arc been done to death? 

I can't think of examples right now but the whole ""main character starts acting cool and distances herself from uncool friend"" is something I'm sure I've seen many times in movies and series. And there's nothing wrong with her character being based on an archetype and providing the conflict for the second act, but it's kind of a missed opportunity to not give her character more depth. During the second act, Danny struggles with his sexuality, Larry just got laid off, Marion has her usual disagreements with Lady Bird and...Julie is mad at Lady Bird because she's acting cool?

I'll have to watch it again because I'm probably wrong seeing as so many people here loved that character. I didn't hate the character by the way, just think it was underdeveloped. I could watch 45 hours of this film, it was really great. Such a good coming of age drama. And the ""some people aren't built happy"" scene freaking left me in tears. It's such a funny film with really sad moments. Loved this flick. [I wrote a spoiler-filled blog post about this movie and what I consider to be one of the themes: empathy. Feel free to check it out.](https://subjectburst.wordpress.com/2018/03/01/lady-bird-empathy-everyone-is-fighting-a-hard-battle/) I didn’t think it was bad, just not for me.  I can see why people love it however.  It has some great acting and I’m sure for a lot of people is kind of nostalgic.

For me however there was some strange music choices and the structure was an issue.  The ending just isn’t very strong, and kind of pulls something out of nothing. good coming of age movie, i dont get why it's so highly rated, but whatever as a middle class kid from CA going to NYU...

this movie hit home really hard

almost too hard

i had a lot of those same conversations and interactions that lady bird had, and i just want to applaud gerwig for capturing reality to the point of it feeling almost voyeuristic Love slice of life type fiction and was not disappointed with this film. The writing, the characters, the acting, the directing was all amazing. Loved every second of it.  I thought this movie was just so strong. It's tough to do coming of age movies and not make them unbearably cheesy but this just felt super real. It reminded me of The Edge of Seventeen in that regard. Just watched it, genuinely the best movie I've seen all year. God Damn has 2017 spoiled us in movie releases. Went into this blind, with zero knowledge of the plot.  Loved it.  My wife was absolutely engrossed (I graduated college in '03, she was '04, so all the music was very, very familiar).

Saoirse Ronan is a wonderful talent, and if she doesn't win any hardware this year, it's safe to say she'll get some down the road.
I dunno if the acne scars were real or makeup, but damn did they complete the image.



EDIT:  Also, what was up with the fat old priest who was talking with Lady Bird's mother?  I have this feeling he may have been a pedo. The ""What number?"" scene had one guy (I think an older man because everyone in the audience was old) really say out loud ""Oh my God Jesus Christ!""

I'm a 25 year old dude and I felt I could completely relate to the movie. I can't decide whether this one or Three Billboards was my favourite of the year, but it is definitely one or the other. Great film! Very tight - cohesive writing, cinematography, soundtrack, editing, wow! Authentically presented story, believable characters, and all these little details added without deviating from the main story or crying out in complete obviousness. The usual cringe moments were handled gracefully and the turning points actually carried impact instead of just drama. Coming from someone whose typical experience with coming-of-age movies were of ones aimed at much younger audiences, this is really refreshing! A lot of mixed reactions in here and I can certainly see why that is. I thought the movie was cute but overhyped personally. The film had a playful tone yet approached issues with a realistic light. It'll definitely tug an emotional chord when you can relate with Lady Bird or another character. Overall, I'd give it a solid 4/5 stars. I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would. The character is 4 years older than me and the other gender but was really relatable to my relationship with my mom



Also the college scenes were really well done and made the character a lot more likeable 

 And I loved that her mom acted similarly when Lady Bird broke down outside of boyfriend #2's house. They're both strong, loving women who support the same people they aren't particularly happy with when it matters the most.  Agreed, that hit me hard as well. I didn't expect it, but when it happened it felt so right.  I loved that. It's her first good deed she doesn't feed to her ego. She's not playing up the role of Danny's cool friend who supports him and keeps his secret. She's just being a good friend. The way Saoirse Ronan whispered ""I won't tell"" and the way the anger on her face just melts away when she realizes what's happening. Goddamn that scene floored me. I thought the whole film was very good, but that was the scene that really made me tear up. Excellent performance by both actors in that scene.  In a single moment you (and she) realise that what he's going through and is about to go through is really awful and eclipses what he did to her. Haha his delivery was great.  that was literally why my parents didn't get divorced lmao i had a giggle I watched it with a group of friends and that whole third act had me trembling in tears. It took everything I had in me to stay inaduible so I wouldn't ruin the movie for the rest of the audience. Yes. I completely lost it at this line. 

Is anyone built happy? Wait when was this said exactly? favorite line in the film by far This is a super late reply because I barely had a chance to see it in my local theater but this is a movie that seems to meander but does so in the right ways to build the narrative it wants to tell.

I can see how a lot of people might not understand it right away and be turned off, but I hope anyone who does so gives it a fair chance because it's fantastic overall.   I thought the movie was so funny. I was laughing pretty often, but I went by myself and most of the people in my theatre were older couples so I couldn't tell if I was a psychopath or just that nobody else was getting it. ""Yeah I don't really believe in money. I just barter for everything now."" I'm in NorCal and his line, ""That's hella tight"" had the entire audience rolling. I'm so glad there was a ""hella"" in the film. Wouldn't be accurate without it. As soon as I saw him reading Zinn i started laughing  Haha I was like ""omg I was that guy when I was in high school!""  Except not cool! Definitely felt that Damn, I'm glad someone else got that vibe too.  I was thinking *Napoleon Dynamite* as well.

I also got a slightly *Easy A* vibe, but what I loved even more is the incredible flaws in every character whereas Emma Stone was a perfect student. Obviously these are different movies, but I drew a couple of parallels. 

We need more well-done, coming-of-age, female-lead stories.  I got some Rushmore flashbacks too > I love that we are now getting at a point where we can have early 2000s period pieces.

And this is how you know you're old. I fucking lost it when it cut to them listening to DMB. So funny And call me crazy, but I feel like so little has changed since 2002.  Don't get me wrong, I am sure things have, but to me it feels like if someone fell asleep in a coma in 2002 and woke up today they would be able to get right back into the swing of things. The crying scene was what really solidified for me that Greta Gerwig has a real visual talent for directing. Most first time directors would have shot coverage to death on that, and almost ALL first time directors who were previously actors would punch in for the emotional close-ups, but choosing to stay in the medium/wide shot the way she did was a fantastic choice. She never let the audience get comfortable by editing into the scene, she just holds back and lets us experience it all at once, in real time. Heartbreaking, raw, touching, and most importantly, simple.

There was lots of little visual stuff all through the movie that makes me excited for her future as a filmmaker. > The scene with Lucas Hedges crying into Ronan was the best highlight for me

This is the first scene that made me cry. And it was crazy cause I was literally laughing with no hint of it seconds earlier and I went from 0-60 in no time.

This was a remarkable movie. I TOTALLY started crying when they were in the alley and Lucas was sobbing. Oh my gosh that was the saddest part for me, and it kept GOING which I almost appreciated because I've noticed, in recent films, they cut the emotional scene short. Glad they let us feel it out. [deleted] That moment was the one that got me the most, as well.  When I was in high school, I could never understand how two mutual friends of mine remained friends after a similar thing happened. I couldn't figure out how the woman in the relationship got over that situation.  It just never clicked that my male friend needed support in such a difficult time in his life and she was willing to look past the heartbreak and be there for him.  13 years later a movie I'm seeing when I'm 30 finally helps me get it.  I almost started crying right there.  Easily the most powerful moment in the movie for me.  She did co-direct Nights and Weekends... though very, very different films. Exactly. One of the best debuts I’ve ever seen. It was incredibly touching.  He was so funny. The line about bartering made me laugh so hard.

Also ""I think what you do is very baller. It's very anarchist."" It's funny, I'm from northern California so that line just seemed like throwaway dialogue to me.  I was so happy when the Sister wasn't mad about her vandalizing her car. I thought for sure we were going to a cliche one small mistake ruins her life angle but they just laughed it off. > no difference between love and paying attention

Man, that line cut me *bitterly*. [Lucas Hedges](http://d2fz9dc0ngozcr.cloudfront.net/images/zoolander-paris-fashion-1.jpg) Him and Caleb Landry Jones have been in a lot of movies in the past year it feels like Just to be somewhat contrarian:

While j thought he was remarkable in Lady Bird, and brilliant in Manchester, I dont think his performance in Three Billboards was at the same level. He certainly wasn't bad, but it wasn't remarkable in the same way those other two roles were.

(Which isn't to take away from his performance in Three Billboards, or from his growing and dazzling resume.) One hell of a resume so far Ya the film was so starkly real throughout it'd be weird to suddenly have a hokey moment like that It'll definitely continue to get a wider release as awards season picks up. But I think this film is a lock for Original Screenplay, at the very least.  I'm a guy and I still related to my relationship with my mother. I resonated with the disconnect they both had, how they couldn't quite communicate their feelings without being stubborn. I also related to having a disagreement with my mom, and her thinking I'm ungrateful because of it, and suddenly I both feel guilty that she feels that way but upset that she throws her sacrifices in my face over an unrelated issue. Christine's mom didn't know how to healthily communicate her feelings, so she resorted to writing a letter that she didn't even end up sending. But the final scene shows that they've evolved in their communication of their love to each other.  If this wins all the awards, I would be very happy. Definitely deserves nominations for Best Actress and Best Director. I think it could lose either one to Three Billboards.
 I like Gerwig but I never really got the hype until this. Frances Ha is not made for me, the whole time I thought ""get your shit together"" but Lady Bird was phenomenal. Absolutely loved this movie.  I'm not a girl so maybe I'm not intended as its target audience, but I did relate to it in that it did remind me of my own relationship with my parents, and certainly my sister's. But I also saw it with a girl who's right in the target demo and she seemed to absolutely hate it, which I found odd considering how universally praised it's been.

Overall I feel like I fall more into #2. It's a solid movie with stellar performances, performances that lift it passed the mediocrity of the script and directing. I have some pretty big pacing and writing problems with it, especially in the last act of the movie where, at one point, they seemingly drop every single subplot and rush through Lady Bird going off to college and having her first New York experience. 

It's a relatable, fun movie but I don't see why it's getting so much high praise compared to, for example, The Big Sick (which is getting high praise in its own right but like isn't breaking RT records despite being more original and just as relatable to certain crowds) I didn't really relate to it but I thought it was very good. The best parts of it in my opinions were the callbacks, which we might think of as unnecessary but really build the world of the story. Like when the play director cries first, it's a comedic moment (at least in my theatre people laughed), but then they show him later really suffering. That is some of the best movie-making I have ever seen.

Also the callback with the water and the bathtub - that's something I definitely can't relate to, but I always enjoy a good callback. Tracy Letts is said to be one of the nicest and sweetest actor and playwright in Broadway. I'm gonna jump on that Lady Bird before trilogy train right now. I'd watch the shit out of that every time. 

You mentioned the quality of teen movies these days, I also agree wholeheartedly. After Lady Bird ended, I realized that one of my favourite niche film genres are ***realistic depictions of teenhood***. Other examples in my mind are American Vandal, The Inbetweeners (UK), and Summer Heights High. 

Perhaps it's because I'm in my early twenties and think wistfully of my teen years now, so seeing those formative years so accurately represented on-screen is refreshing compared to the contrived version of high school you so often see.  I would add *The Way Way Back* to your list. Perhaps you would enjoy Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Yep. Went to a private, Catholic school (kindergarten through high school) and could not agree more. The little touches were like that were great. 'Short Term 12' as well belongs in that Teen Movies category. At least I think so. It may not focus on High School, but it really captures the feeling of 'inbetween-ness' of adolescence and adulthood.

But I totally agree, we're in an entirely new era of those movies and it's wonderful. Perks of being a wallflower?  > The movie is near-perfect at encapsulating all the things that make Sacramento unique

Really? Because I grew up in suburban Kansas City in the '90s and  it felt like it could have been set there without any real changes. Just replace a few specific references with equivalent local ones. > The cuts between her and her mom driving though Sacramento gave me the biggest smile. Just everything about it was perfect.

I got legit goosebumps during this sequence. Wasn't expecting it to affect me that much, but yeah, it was awesome. It did not not make me smile. A strong hit of nostalgia though. The proper kind of nostalgia where it's as beautiful as it is painful to reminisce. It made me miss my hometown, and that part of my childhood.  > One was a sudden fear of being so far from literally everyone and everything I knew.

I remember wanting to go to this science high school when I was kid. Had the papers ready and then just one night I was overcome with a sense of loneliness at the prospect of going to school at a different place without my parents. Shit man, I cried to the point my dad had to check up on me. I told him then and there that I didn't want to go to the science high school. Biggest regret of my life. I'm 27 and I felt like I understood both sides, somewhat. I think the scene with the nun talking about the college essay was really pivotal, where she describes Lady Bird's obvious love of Sacramento. I think the line was, ""Have you considered they might be the same thing? Love and attention?"" 

Lady Bird's mother cares SO MUCH about her, about her future and her safety and yes, even her happiness, that it has turned into this convoluted, obsessive, unhealthy pressure. I saw the exact same thing happen with my mom and sister, who are very alike and clashed all the time, but it wasn't because there wasn't love there, it was just that there was a lack of patience and compassion to go along with it. 

I can't speak to your specific situation, but it took my sister moving out and gaining her own perspective away from my mom for their relationship to improve, and it still took several years after that for them to really ""get along"". My sister had to let go of her anger, and my mom had to let go of her fear. yo. I get this. I personally think the mother character(while very well done by Metcalf and somewhat relatable) borders on abusive in many ways.

Like, I think that the mother loves her daughter as a child but not the person that child is. There doesn't seem to be any help in developing into an actual adult. 

I keep reading people say, ""that was the relationship between my mother and me""... and I wonder... how many people would not be talked to by their mother's for months.. .just for applying for college... and how odd that sounds.
 I think you'll still ""relate"" to them. I find that very specific coming of age films have a universality to them that can be appreciated at all ages, because we all go through things like this even if we didn't do the exact same things. The only thing that'll change is how you react to them. If you're like me, I find myself feeling the struggles of the parents the older I get while also recognizing the shitty behavior of the youth more.

I had a very complex reaction to *Lady Bird* because I found myself relating to almost all the characters at one point. The benefits of getting older are that your feelings can get more multi-dimensional. There's some beauty in that gray area you can appreciate.  > Movies like these make me really not want to be a grown up

that's because they fetishize the High School experience to no end  Lois Smith has had a heck of a year, with this and Marjorie Prime (which she starred in) I agree, that was one harsh ass scene.

I guess I just don't understand the mother.. and don't much like her.  Ladybird appears to be the only one trying to open or keep the communications lines open, pretty much the whole movie.

The mother insults her, tells her not to apply to any schools not within 20 minutes drive, and apparently doesn't even fill out the fafsa(school loan papers) because the father sneakily did that.

Ladybird fills out the application herself, pays for it herself, and keeps it to herself because of her mother's derisive comments about this exact thing.

The mother finds out about it and doesn't talk to her own daughter for weeks/months.

Why?

Doesn't finish up any of the letters to talk to her daughter/explain to her daughter.  

why?

Doesn't call or write(granted, we don't know how long she had actually been at school)

why?

why does ladybird have to be the adult in the parent/child relationship? Especially this. I equally enjoy the scenes with Tracy Letts as Lady Bird's father because of the warmth he brings to counterbalance the fights between Lady Bird and her mom.  And the movie presents that truth in a scene: the head sister telling Lady Bird something along the lines of, ""Love and paying attention are the same thing."" In other words: the opposite of love is not hate, but rather, indifference.

The mother ignoring Lady Bird in the scene you described was the hardest to watch because that was when the mother was the complete opposite of love. Even the scene in which the mother told Lady Bird she did not believe in her success, which involved furious, spiteful shouting by both parties was easier to watch. Why? Because the opposite of love is not hate, but rather, indifference.

On the other hand, if you were like me, some of the most beautiful moments showed the inverse of that: how one character paid attention to a second and thus, showed their love for them.

For example, Lady Bird, at the end of her disastrous prom, seeks out her best friend Julie. She is welcomed inside by Julie's mother, wanting Julie's attention to comfort her about Kyle, but then sees that Julie is crying. Immediately, without a thought for herself and the reason why she arrived, Lady Bird is there to comfort Julie once she realizes her friend's depression (mirroring her realisation of her own father's depression and her inability at that time to understand and help). This shows how deep down, Lady Bird truly loves her best friend.

In addition: The scene in which Lady Bird is finally ready to confront Danny about his ""betrayal"" of her. She is ready to demand his attention, but as soon as she mentions and Danny reveals his true fear of being unable to come out to his parents, Lady Bird immediately is ready to comfort him and provide him support, showing how loving and empathetic she is of him.

And, although you see many of her extensive flaws (such as her ability to manipulate other people for her own ends), because she is capable of such levels of love and empathy, she thus redeems herself.

The mother is also an example of this. The morning after Lady Bird loses her virginity, her mother arrives to take her home. The mother seems about to yell at Lady Bird for her ""transgression"", but when she sees how upset Lady Bird is over Kyle's lie, she immediately begins to cry with her daughter and embraces her, giving her love and attention.

And this thread leads into another. Both the mother and Lady Bird are flawed, but yet, are humanizing in the same way. They both are able to put others' needs before their own. This is parallel to the final scene in which Lady Bird described driving on the roads of Sacramento for the first time, how that connected to her home. And the scene transitions between moments of Lady Bird driving and her mother driving, presenting the thought that they truly are mother and daughter. And the fact that they both have the same redeeming aspect of being able to put others' needs before their own also presents this parallel.

Apologies, I saw this movie recently and have not had the opportunity to discuss this with anyone. It resonated with me on such a profound level! Most likely will delete this in several hours Tracy Letts - who plays the Dad - is an award-winning playwright and great actor (see ""Homeland."") Where you saw ""dopey,"" I saw depressed, caring and gentle.  He wasn't really dopey...

That's an interesting adjective. Yeah I really felt for his character. The way he was able to swallow his pride and still be happy for his son getting that job was really touching. His reaction at the end of the production had me in hysterics even Armond White liked it. Yup. Didn't really understand the hype in the first act, but then it just kept getting better and better. It's one of my favorite films since Beasts of the Southern Wild. And so far it's the year's best. And the mom was just _spectacular_. Yeah I'm also 27 and the ending hit me hard. I also moved away from a fairly boring city and now I do miss it and appreciate the sacrifices my parents made. Also excited for 2000s period piece movies. Danny wearing a shell necklace was very 2002. [deleted] I am right there with StarDestinyGuy. This was the current movie I had the most interest in seeing and, having read a number of reviews, expected to think it was an all time great. Now, I liked it, a whole lot, and the acting was excellent. But, yeah, I also gave it an 8. which felt like less than I had expected it to deserve.  Nothing in the movie was really surprising (since we had all seen that rolling out of the car scene multiple times in the trailer). Yes, charming
coming of age movie, but nothing to make us sit up and say, ""Wow, I have never seen that before."" [deleted] *Exactly* how I felt, judging by Reddit's reaction I thought it would be ground breaking - and to me it just wasn't. I don't understand people saying they were bawling at points, obviously in the minority here. I think this is how I feel. Though I also get this feeling that I may just not have enough of a cinematic sense to appreciate it. I liked it, as you said, but it seemed like just a good story and good acting, nothing astounding.

Also, something about the writing, particularly the humor, felt a little bit off. It's hard to pin down exactly what it was though. Some of the jokes just seemed too on the nose maybe? Or like, slips in tone? Really hard to put my finger on it. The over the top goofiness of the drama 'coach' scene stuck out for one.

Maybe part of the slight dissonance I'm talking about had something to do with a deliberate attempt to give the feeling of time passing, and relationships fluctuating over time.

I don't know, but I did like the movie. Never expect a masterpiece.  Nothing will ever live up to your expectations of what you think a masterpiece is.  You'll always spend your time subconsciously finding flaws that disqualifies it from whatever a ""masterpiece"" is.  This was a very well done coming of age film.  I enjoyed it a lot.  [deleted] Likewise. I just saw it today and based on the hype I saw I was expecting something *more*. It was good, but like you said it was just kinda a standard Coming of Age film. 

I thought it had some similar vibes to Florida Project in how it touches mildly on the other characters having their own issues, but I felt like Florida Project did it better. 

Either way, still an enjoyable film but not the best of the year like some people make it out to be.  I liked it a lot, I didn't love it. There were definitely beats and moments in it that didn't really work for me but I did enjoy it overall.

It's really a very strong directorial debut though for Gerwig. I would love to see her continue in this field.  I live in LA now but I grew up in Fairfield so I understood all the little Sacramento jokes and it was awesome. I watched it with my friends from NorCal and we all burst out laughing when the guy at the party asks where she's from and at first she says Sacramento, and he says ""what?"" and then she changes her answer to San Francisco. How often we answered ""San Francisco"" to that question because nobody knows where the hell Fairfield is. > Saoirse Ronan absolutely deserves any of the accolades she ends up getting from this one

she won the NYFC This might be some part of what felt slightly off about the movie to me as well. I was torn between looking at it two different ways;

On the one hand it could be seen as somewhat sloppy editing or a poor stylistic choice, pretty straightforwardly what you're talking about.

It also occurred to me that it might have been intended/best interpretted as a way to show the ebb and flow of time, emotion, and relationships between Lady Bird and the people in her life. The movie doesn't take place over a very long period of time, but months do pass, and to some extent the editing may have helped to convey that feeling that in some way we *are* seeing varyingly independent vignettes over a transitional point in her life. More interestingly though, I think, was the people/relationship side of this; just as it sometimes felt like a scene would cut away in a rather abrupt or divisive way, so Lady Bird's relationships with people, especially her mother, fluctuated and cut to sometimes drastic extremes. This feeling of discontinuity resonated with me as a reflection of how people are sometimes so inconsistent in how they treat those closest to them at different times, and whether or not it was a deliberate effect, I can't help but think there might be something to the idea that this movie did an interesting job of materializing that idea.

Anyway I still don't really know, these are just my vague impressions. I liked that a lot about it. Kept quick momentum. Senior year of high school ends up feeling like vignettes anyway, in my experience.  Went into this film already feeling overrated. But the whole ride was just so well executed. It was really, really good. I wanted to write mean things and say reviewers were wrong but I left the theatre in awe. Really good film. Highly recommend it. 

Best Films of 2017 for me:

Logan, Big Sick and Lady Bird.  Hope this isn't too forward, but if you want an epiphany, here's one for you: don't wait. If you're not living your life where you are now, it won't get any easier later just because you changed locations. That doesn't mean you have to love your life or that you can't aspire to more, but if there's one thing wise people agree on, it's that true fulfillment doesn't come from circumstances, it comes from within. For me it was when Lady Bird asked her mom if she liked her, her mom responded that of course she loved her and Lady Bird clarified ""No, do you LIKE me?""  I almost started crying because it hit too close to home; I wish I had the balls to ask my mom that. Hahaha out of all the comments here this one made me laugh the most Also watched it in Sacramento. I thought it was really cool to see a brief shot of a movie theater while sitting inside the same theater! I wasn't too distracted by people's reactions to some of the locations, personally it added to the experience for me. On the other hand, that is just exactly what I would expect from Sacramento people; it almost sounds like a scene from the movie itself. > it was like watching a movie with a crowd from 1895 who were utterly aghast that the things they saw right outside were magically appearing on the screen before them

Man that line cracked me up

 Yeah, when they were making out in the hallway and going into the tanning-bed room he said he'd never done it before. Yes, and I think he lied to Lady Bird about his experience and conquests, to hurt her. In a moment of passion, he was honest that he was also a virgin but after Lady Bird took the more dominant role in their first encounter (i.e. being on top) and then emotionally talked about their shared deflowering, he freaked out and decided to play the 'cool guy' role with her to take back the power in their relationship. What I did like about the film is that characters like Kyle aren't one note villains - the guy had potential as a human being and was going through a very difficult time with a dying father, but he wasn't emotionally equipped to be a good boyfriend and person at this point in his life. Almost every person in the story had redeeming qualities, but they also acted petty, immature and selfishly (amazingly, this is what real life is like).  If it wasn't abundantly clear, Kyle was *not* meant to be a sympathetic character. If that wasn't obvious from any single time that he opened his mouth haha. They are all hipsters but it's presented as them trying to act wacky in a concerted effort to find meaning, not that they are automatically special because they are quirky. It's never explained why she calls herself Lady Bird, it's just something weird she made up to try to give herself some depth. There's no inherent meaning or reasoning behind it >You don't see any bullying stereotypes

I was totally expecting LB's second-friend and that friend group to be way worse than they were. Yea, there were some mean comments from them like calling her weird behind her back when they were picking her up for prom, but generally they were kind and had some sort of deeper-than-surface-level relationship with her.

It was really pleasant to see them take this much more realistic and non-stereotypical approach to a high-school setting.  I think the flaws in Christine's characters fit perfectly with the film. If people are turned off by it, they should think about who they were at that age. What 17 year old isn't selfish and self-centered? Who didn't do something mean like lie to their friends to be with someone they had a crush on? It's sort of the point of the movie, growing up and making mistakes. Judging by the reviews, hopefully most people will get that. Priests are supposed to be a person someone can go to for support when struggling, but who does the priest go to?  I loved this aspect of the movie, showing priests and nuns as ordinary people who have ordinary struggles and interests, and a sense of humor. Because in my experience that’s the reality. I didn’t understand, was he depressed? Cancer? I’m the closet? Why was he so withdrawn? >One question tho.. what was that scene with the Father Leviatch and Lady Bird’s mother about? Was he ill? 

I think going by her job, he was depressed. Remember how he was the first to start crying in the acting exercise?  Spoilers: Ladybird's classmate was saying that there were rumors that before he became a priest his wife left him and his son overdosed. Have to assume there's some truth to this and he has been struggling ever since hence that scene when he was the first to cry in drama class. 

She said it so matter of fact that everyone in my theatre laughed at it but when we got to the scene of him meeting with Ladybird's mom, it made sense. She was taking double shifts at the psych ward, for mental health. Another great connection and way to show that parents are emotional beings and also struggle with life, going through their own shit. Poor guy.  I mean. People have different preferences. Nothing to worry about.  Yeah dude, I agree.  I'm not the biggest slice of pie movie fan though.  Like why am I commending someone for making a movie about ordinary life?  It's not even so far back to where the time period is interesting. I enjoyed it, but I also wasn't blown away. I had heard nothing about the movie and just came across the description when I was looking up what was playing at the Landmark. I was impressed with Saoirse Ronan in Brooklyn and was interested in seeing Gerwig's debut so I figured why not. Good movie, but I didn't walk away with as strong an impression as say The Big Sick. Trust me that can still happen in Midwestern Towns.

High School is often boring and shitty.  Sounds like you'll have a lot to relate to. See it ASAP > Much like the synopsis of the character I read, I dislike this city and have always wanted to leave. I don't know if the main character ends up escaping for her dreams or what but I'm 34 and still haven't managed it. A lot of my buddies joke that it's just an open-air prison with a blackhole at the bottom. It always sucks you back. For me, family. 

Just wanted to say, as a fellow Sacramento person, I totally understand where you're coming from. Weirdly enough, I ended up moving back, albeit I was not nearly as negative in my perception of the decision to return.  

However, I just wanted you to know that this movie is going to 1000% hit you in the guts.  I think there's a lot of parallels to your situation to the main character's life story.  Spoiler: [She does indeed go to the East Coast to go to an unnamed school in NYC.](#spoiler) But I believe the ending of the film [(The phone call/voicemail with the montage of vignettes of Sacramento were so fucking perfect)](#spoiler) is the absolute perfect encapsulation of my feelings around this area: Home is always going to be home.  Don't let it stop you from forging your own path.  Wish you the best of luck my friend. Same, such a heartwarming and real movie. Ending was slightly abrupt but I didn't mind it too much. I don't think it was over-hyped. I heard it was great, went in with high hopes. But I did not expect to be so moved by a movie.

**Now I should preface this with a PSA: 90% of the time someone sees a movie in theaters they don't like it, then they see it again a year later on Netflix and start to like it and appreciate [source: my rectum and personal observations]. I think this is because not enough people actually go to a movie theatre *by themselves,* so when they leave they don't get a chance to sit with it before their friend starts talking about it.**

Okay, now with that said, I saw it by myself and gave my brain to the director. I probably like it because I related to it so well. The scene where the mother is silently washing the dishes while Lady Bird is screaming for her attention almost had me in tears, it brought back a lot of frustration and helpless desperation that I personally experienced as a teen, but I think for a broader audience it really exemplifies the point that mother thinks she knows what's ""best"" but in reality it's demoralizing and traumatizing for your child who really is still dependent on you despite trying to become their own person.

The things she went through with school and boyfriends and the popular crowd, all yes and yes and yes. She's experimenting with so many different identities. The depressed father who shows this heart-warming unconditional support and love for his daughter without ever seeing the personal toll it takes on him shows how the father, a soft-spoken character who bends to his wife, followed the ""right"" path in life and it gave him a humble yet depressing life. And then when Lady Bird tells the guy at the end she's from San Francisco because he doesn't know where Sacramento is, I think that was fucking brilliant because it reveals that her old identity is an ambiguous blur of the past to other people in her new city (and as someone who has lived in 5 different cities in the last 5 years, I can tell you I do that all the time). 

What was most beautiful about the film though was at the end, when shots of Lady Bird and her mom flash between each other as they do the same drive in their home town, and it really comes through that her psycho mom was like her once, struggling to find her identity, and just did what she did out of love because she didn't want her daughter to end up having the same life she did. 

I walked out of that fucking theatre with goosebumps. It just perfectly captured the REAL transition from child to adulthood. The angst, the desperation, the loneliness, the lack of appreciation for what you have until it's gone, and some insight in to what it's like being a parent while your child is going through that shit. I wanted to call my parents afterward myself. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Gerwig takes the familiar tropes and makes them seem fresh, authentic, and lived in.

This isn't just ""another coming of age story,"" it's the Aristotelian Ideal of coming of age stories. 


 Eh. I think you're being a little reductive in your criticisms. I know that a lot of people seem to judge films for falling into tropes as opposed to how it actually handles those tropes. Tropes are tropes because they work.
 It's a coming of age in the ""whatever year you came to age in"" it appeals to late 20ish men and mostly woman so if you aren't in that demo than it wont flick all the switches for you. Yet it's still a really great movie just like ""Everybody Wants Some!"" was even though I can't relate to being a college baseball player in the 80's. The main demo for reddit is teen through 20's that's why it's hyped so much. I mean, who else would say ""I won't touch your boobs because I respect you"" when the girl clearly says that she wants you to touch them. That's not really respect. From Sacramento. Can confirm... have done this many times! One thing I really enjoyed was how the movie wasn't some big story wrapped up in a 2 hour capsule where the credits roll and everything is a-okay now. It was about Lady Bird's life and you could really get a sense for the time before the movie started and then after it finished you could feel like there was going to be more to her life. It wasn't the case where the credit roll and everything stops sorta thing if that makes sense. Like if the whole movie is all about just one thing then at the very end that thing comes true and then credit roll. This was just a 2 hour condensed showing of this girls last 2ish years of highschool into college and I think that helped with the realism of it because it was so familiar to everyone. And the character were familiar at least to me as well because everyone felt like an actual person with redeeming characteristics and faults- no just one hero or whatever.
Tbh I think it really just comes down to how well you connect to the characters, because even though Lady Bird was the main character I went on for most of the movie in this weird balance was disliking her a whole lot but at the same time wishing I could just reach through the screen and give her a hug bc her mom wasn't doing that for her. I think that emotional response that came out of me is why I enjoyed the film so much. agree w all of this. i think maybe the hype is bc there are so many fewer art films at the cinema these days. if this were straight to streaming i would've never finished watching it. ""I don't believe in money anymore but hey, check my brand new amazing car and my huge ass bedroom with a suite and stuff. But hey, I don't believe in money.""

Yeah, I've dealt with a couple of these throughout my life. I think you're writing his character off a little too fast. 

Yes he is a ""narcissistic aloof self-proclaimed intellectual"" but he is also a *teenager*, which is the point of this movie. 

From his perspective his dad worked, made a lot of money, only to be diagnosed with terminal cancer. It's not unreasonable that as kyle sits in his fancy house and drives his nice car he thinks that there is more to life than becoming rich (which has truth to it)

Obviously his comments are extremely naive (and frustrating because he is rich), but again... he's growing up too. Yeah I flinched when she arrived in New York because I had been preparing for closure with the tearful goodbye at the airport. What came next was nice and I have a thousand great things to say about the film, but finding myself thinking ""Oh, I guess it isn't over yet"" is super distracting in a movie, even one I had been enjoying as much as Lady Bird. 

Logan Lucky did that as well and I honestly thought I was in hell because it just wouldn't end.  I also had an abusive mother but I don't feel like it was that cathartic at least for me. She is still trying to appease her abuser and maintains that relationship at the end and that really bugged me.  Sorry bro, its about the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 WCF. A lot of people agree that it should have ended at the airport, but the scene where she thanks her mom is very necessary and provides closure imo I suppose there would be ways to re-edit and write it such that you don't need the NYC scene, but as is, you absolutely do need it. Her still lying about her upbringing and origin after everything she went through and then redeeming herself with the phone call was amazing. The juxtaposition of her and her mom driving through Sacramento was beautiful. And her waking up in a hospital to see the kid bandaged head and covered eye, to me, was the perfect encapsulation of the movie. 

I watched it last night and all the NYC stuff has stuck with me as much as anything else in the movie.

Plus we certainly don't need another movie that ends with someone running through an airport. > Someone else also told me that it was better than BR 2049 so that didn't help either.

They share a medium, but that's an otherwise unnatural comparison in terms of genre, story, style, and what they're each ""going for"" in terms of purpose. \#HotTake It was very weird in structure. Like the first half continuously built up, but then after the first boyfriend it speeds through the year's events and then just ends without a major point. Greta said that her original screenplay was like 350 screen pages. I think she wanted to add a lot but like real-life, you only get parts of the truth. The perspective of the movie is largely her, anyway. I am totally fine with not having answers to, or even full, subplots. The film was about Lady Bird and her mother. The extra stories and characters are used to show us more about the two characters that matter the most.  I thought it was meant to make her feel dumb for being in the hospital for something as stupid as drinking too much. It was a reminder that other people have real problems, and she shouldn't be working herself up over her tiny ones.  He was there with his mother. 

It was after this that she went to church and called her own mother. 

Maybe she was feeling sad that her mom wasn't there to comfort her? Maybe she was remembering all the times her mom was there for her when she got hurt? Maybe it mirrored a scene that got cut, where her mom sits with her while she gets her cast? 

Regardless, it was about the boy and his mother Maybe she realized shes been partially blind to life up until this point. just a guess  [deleted] This doesn't even compare to Boyhood in my opinion. The visceral emotional impact of Boyhood really impressed me as I watched the boy grow up. Ladybird didn't have the same impact on me, partly because I didn't feel so sympathetic with the antagonist.   I felt like Lady Bird had a subtle side theme of depression and people's struggles with it. I think both that preacher, Lady Bird's dad, and her best friend all struggled with depression. It also had a fantastic line from Lady Bird's best friend about it, ""Not all people are built happy."" The Drama teacher is the one that the popular girl is gossiping about near Lady Bird and her friend. His son is the one that OD'd on heroin.  My husband pointed out that it's the holidays around the time he quits, and that's usually a time where people who suffer from depression (he lost his son) can struggle the most. He probably took a sabbatical.   I actually really appreciated how they didn't go through and explain every detail to the audience, I like it when the writers assume the audience is intelligent enough to figure out the plot and details on their own.  Lots of teenage girls have strained relationships with their moms for no other reason than they are teenage girls and their moms exist.  I know because I was one! My mom was fine but when I was a teenager I was sure her sole purpose in life was to thwart me and embarrass me.  I was a self-centered little shit and so were most of my friends.  In other words I loved Lady Bird.  As to Miguel, one of the letters her mom wrote her refers to her as being a miracle and they didn't think they could have kids so it is implied that Miguel was adopted.  As for not getting any backstory, most of us don't.  What made my mom the woman she is?  I could barely give you an answer now and I certainly couldn't even have hazarded a guess when I was a teenager so that rang true to me.  I mean, in a much broader way, you're really really not supposed to think that Ladybird knows what she's talking about most of the time. In fact, that was a huge part of the movie. They specifically highlight how her college application essay was a beautiful tribute to Sacramento, when she arrives in New York, it's not nearly like she imagined, and then the movie specifically ends with her phoning her mother to talk about how beautiful Sacramento was when she was first driving.

The fact that she had a special connection to Sacramento was kinda a major plot point, and not one that was very subtle. And yes she spent a long time trashing Sacramento in the movie, but she's a rebellious teenager... teenagers say that about wherever they grow up. A large part of this movie was a really in depth examination of what that really means, and people's connection to where they grow up.

So I'm really confused if you see this and think it's making fun of Sacramento in some way. Sacramento is really important to the characters in the movie. the ""hate your home town and have to leave"" is a common trope in coming of age films At the end she realizes that New York is not what she imagined and that Sacramento was more beautiful and special. Her being overly critical initally was definitely on purpose to show that she wasn't appreciative of what she already had. Which was a big theme throughout the film. like how she took her friend for granted and how she treated her parents who worked hard to give her as much as they could.
 What the guys/gals said before me. If you understood the movie well, you'll see that Lady Bird loved Sacramento and misses it. she was a teenager who was born and raised in that area. Of course she wanted to travel and see other places... and maybe a few seasons as well.

 [My interpretation was that he knew he was gay but he was doing everything he could to suppress/deny it. He probably figured that if he kissed Lady Bird enough or told her he loved her, he would be ""cured.""](#spoiler) She worked in a psychiatric hospital, I assume he had tried to kill himself or something. Very good? yes
Worth all the hype? no The implication was that he was suffering from crippling depression. He lost a child before joining the priesthood, plus in the 'who can cry first' theater game he turned into a puddle of despair. To me, that scene was there to compare how caring and compassionate the mother could be, even to complete strangers as a sort of compare and contrast on how she treated her own daughter.

 Also when her mom comforts the original drama teacher and promises not to share news about his illness great parallel  tracy letts is the sh*t I know I'm late to the party as your comment is already a month old(For reference, so you don't have to hit the context button to figure out WTF I'm talking about, it's about Lady Bird), but I just wanted to comment that your sentiments totally resonated with me. I saw the movie today and wanted to check out the discussion, and your post just resonated with me too much not to comment.

I'm so glad I not only watched this without friends, but in an empty theater. I was ugly sobbing by the end of the movie. About my only thought leaving was 'Thank god no one was there to see that'. UGH GOD, same here, sniffling boogies and everything, too relatable  Yes, some people are. Which I think makes the line all the more poignant, because also some people aren't.  I think Christine's best friend says this on the couch when she sees her the night of prom and she had been crying.  Man I was sold right from the very first scene. The acting, dialogue, her dynamic with the mom. It was all perfect. It honestly kind reminded of The Social Network opening break-up scene. An awesome dialogue-heavy scene that totally sets the tone for the movie and the main character It did seem to meander, and there were maybe a couple earlier scenes I thought it could have ended on. I don't exactly see the point in the college party throw up scene. But, it ended beautifully, right at the climax of her growth into adulthood.  It was hilarious! We were definitely laughing throughout in my theater, especially after that abortion zinger haha I fucking hated him so much. One of those situations where you knew someone kinda like that and it just brought it all back.  yes. however, and i loved it, but i'm wondering if this was spoken in those circles in 2002? I just burst out laughing at the cut to him just sitting by the pool all moody because of course he would. Sorry. I just now watched the movie. Why was this funny?  I love ""Easy A"" and Emma Stone. Have you seen ""Edge of Seventeen"" starring Hailee Steinfeld? It fits your description quite well.  I don't like this feeling 2002 to 2017 is the same amount of time as 1987 to 2002. This is a huge problem with much of modern cinema, and I'd even venture to say going back to what the French new wave revolution ushered in, in that no matter the talent level of the director, so many simply don't know how to let a scene ""breathe."" I've seen this far too often where they go in for a close up, cut away, pan in/out, jump cut, have the camera start to creep forward, etc.  Agreed. The film did a great job at shaping how happy moments easily turn sad. I think his lines were great during that scene. When he mentions just giving him some time so he can come out to his parents first, it broke my heart. He had that on his mind since he got caught, must've been a terrible time for him. He acted it so perfectly. He got across that he was ashamed of so many different things: himself for being gay, what his family would think, the fact that he had hurt Lady Bird even though he did truly care for her. And he was ashamed of himself for even being there to talk to her, but he knew he had to go because there was no one else in the world he felt he could talk about it. That scene was so well done, and was so much more than your typical ""closeted gay teen"" movie moment  I thought it was a great moment of Lady Bird realizing that it's not all about her pain and emotions- that's a lesson we all need to learn. I also loved that they made it pretty clear that Danny came from a pretty conservative family just by simply showing his grandmother's ode to Ronald Reagan in her house. That's awesome that the movie helped you that way. It was a beautiful moment of understanding. I was the guy in that situation, and it's definitely not something most people understand intuitively. I wasn't sure if that scene worked or not so I'm glad to hear it had an effect on you. ""And I haven't lied in two years so..."" So am I and I still laughed. It just makes it *very* clear that it takes place in Sac. Its authenticity was funny. it wasn't like she spraypainted a dick on it.  Same thing with the stolen grade book. I thought for sure it was going to lead to the twist that keeps her from maybe not getting into a college, but kudos to Gerwig for avoiding cliches. Also when Lady Bird threw the binder with grades in the trash can.  It was a pretty good and healthy joke That line still makes me so tear up whenever I think about it. I actually read your comment weeks ago and agreed but I can't stop wondering why that line about love and paying attention affected me so deeply.

I guess I wanted to ask your thoughts on why that line was so impactful? I cant quite figure out why it's rocked me so hard. I would love to hear your thoughts! yep Haven't seen Lady Bird but Frances McDormand blew me away with her performance in Three Billboards. Very excited to see Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird now. Loved her in Brooklyn. Yeah I couldn't get that into Frances Ha either. That character is much more empathetic as a high schooler than a college aged person (even though I am older than college aged and *still* share many characteristics with her of the ""get your shit together"" variety!). Do you think women have problems relating to the main character in the Big Sick? Maybe The Big Sick's target audience is the average Reddit male, and that is why you reacted so strongly to it? To which crowds is The Big Sick ""more relatable"" than Lady Bird? That's great to hear. He better be nice to Carrie Coon damn it. Chicago actor and writer, friend. Broadway may be his second home but the second city is his first. Fuck, I loved that movie. That’s my favorite coming of age movie of the decade probably. A much different style than Lady Bird, so I could see it turning some people off.  *Loved* that one. Saw it on a whim at a film festival and was not disappointed. I guess the difference is that it's not suburban.  It's not set in a suburb of Sacramento, it's set IN Sacramento.  That super amazing house on the sweeping wide boulevard covered in beautiful old trees Lady Bird fantasized about is within walking distance of that hip urban cafe she gets a summer job in.

We're the smallest town of 2 million people in the country. [deleted] During the movie, I kept noticing that they showed the Mom driving frequently (aside from when her dad picks her up). I was glad to see it wasn’t a coincidence, and that it would be an important point in the story. As an even older male, I empathized with mother a lot. And it's even harder in some other ethnic cultures that don't have a lot of expression and openness in it. Sometimes people, especially family, need to let go of things in order to ""get along."" It's hard, but that's what love is, isn't it? This movie reminded me so much of my relationship with my mom.

What you said about your sister having to let go of her anger, and your mom having to let go of her fear. To me that is what this movie is all about. That’s what happened with my mom and I too.

I too understood both “sides” so to speak. When she moves away for school and finally appreciates what her parents have done for her, I started bawling. Absolutely love this movie. 10/10 Yeah I can relate to this. My mother and I will sometimes go months without speaking to each other because every fight we have ends up drudging up the past and the terrible things she did. 

When Lady Bird's mother said 'my mother was an abusive alcoholic' it helped me understand her character. Parents that had bad parents themselves can struggle with compassion and understanding their kids. My mum didn't have a good relationship with her own mother growing up, and she vowed to be different, but in a lot of ways she ended up continuing the cycle of abusive parenting, even if it was to a lesser degree than what she experienced.

We judge ourselves by our intentions, but judge others by their actions. I tried to put myself in Lady Bird's mothers shoes to better understand her: bad childhood, constantly struggling financially, and cannot connect with her daughter. But having been on the other side of a similar parent; someone that means well but ends up abusive or borderline abusive when things don't go their way, it was a struggle to not dislike or even hate Lady Bird's mother.  I think that's definitely an inspiring idea. It's nice to be able to empathize with other perspectives, and I definitely hope that as I become older I can become more open-minded, especially towards new perspectives, than becoming closed-minded, reinforcing my own ideas and becoming ignorant. I think they have a trend of doing it, like in John Hughes's movies, but I think Lady Bird did a pretty good job of making the experience seem almost realistic. I believe that it's nice to watch a movie and know that it's a little unrealistic, but still want to be that quirky character  I dunno man, my high school experience was pretty rad. You get to see your closest friends at least five days a week? That sounds like a fantasy. These days I'm lucky to see just ONE of them over the course of six months. Did it really? Her experience wasn't great - I enjoyed my time in HS a lot more than these characters.  It's the thing that some people have to deal with. My mom is very much similar to Ladybird's mom but not as mean, just unable to communicate and willing to shut off. I deal with it because I have to. My mom isn't a terrible person and she's always tried to provide for me, even doing stupid things like going into debt and keeping it from me my whole life. 


At a certain point, most people aren't willing to grow anymore and act the way they think adults are supposed to. Unable to accept that people need to take their own path in life. The mother is not so one-dimensional as you make her seem; no character in this movie (not even the wealthy girl) is.

There were several good moments that the mother had with her daughter. Comforting her after she lost her virginity and taking her on home tours after, supporting the family with her single job after her husband loses her job, taking the effort to write so many drafts of her letter to Lady Bird as she leaves her nest of Sacramento to attend college in New York City.

For every negative scene there is between Lady Bird and her mother, there is a positive scene of equal proportion.

And that is a theme in and of itself: No relationship is entirely good nor bad, because no person is entirely good nor bad.

Edit: The very first scene is a perfect representation of this. Mother and daughter are both crying, sharing an intimate moment after having concluded ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Lady Bird goes to turn on the radio, the mother asks her not to, and they devolve into an argument. Both good and bad aspects of their relationship are shown in a single scene. And the fact that it is the first scene is foreshadowing how their relationship will be shown as both good and bad throughout the remainder of the film. I took issue with the mother also. This article I found sums up my feelings pretty well, and it sounds like the author is similarly as unimpressed with Marion as you and I: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/11/lady-bird-isnt-about-a-mother-daughter-relationshi.html

If your relationship with your daughter is contentious, (which is nearly unavoidable in the teen years) why would you EVER not take that glint of an opportunity to share a non-contentious moment with her? The shining example of this is when they are looking for prom dresses together. Her daughter loves the dress, desperately seeks mom's approval, and all mom can muster is: ""Isn't it a little too pink?"" 

Perhaps the point is that some people do go through that kind of brutal psychological abuse from their parents who are so damaged by their own past or insecurities that they can barely function as passingly NICE to their children. It's a real and tragic shame, but I am seeing this relationship dynamic touted as being the typical, complex interactions between a tough-loving mother and her rebellious teen daughter. It is deeper and much more sinister than that. 

Marion shifts the responsibility of her aloof demeanor toward and cruel treatment of Lady Bird to her own alcoholic, abusive mother. She never grows in the course of the story and shuts down all communication with her family (even speaking for the father most of the time) when she does not get her way. She is clearly capable of empathy in her career but cannot provide the same kind of empathy for her own child. It is deeply sad. She is not a character to be liked, but perhaps pitied for her own myopia.

Maybe that was the point of the script. I think the bad taste in my mouth is in finding so many reviewers letting Marion slide. But also gut-wrenching because you know deep down he's struggling with depression

> I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anyone else to feel like that.

Quote from Robin Williams that I very closely associated with his character. You are so on point with this. And absolutely right that that scene was the illustration of indifference. Well said.
 I loved his character so much. When the mom said, ""your dad has been struggling with depression for years,"" it made me so sad. When even someone like *him* likes this movie (and not just as a contrarian anomaly), you know it's something special Dude gave bad reviews to Tom of Finland and The Meyerowitz Stories. How is that even possible? How’s that even possible. He’s literally a career contrarian  > Beasts of the Southern Wild.

I've never seen Beasts, but only heard good things. It struck me as a fantasy film which doesn't usually appeal to me. What did you like so much about it? I might order the blu-ray. I DIED when I saw the pooka shell necklace Saw it again tonight. It's not a hard movie to decipher obviously, but there are a lot of little set up and payoff things going on in the background kind of - 

- First scene, Lady bird asks her mom why she doesn't call her Lady Bird like she said she would, and 4 or 5 scenes later her mom calls her Lady Bird instead of Christine 

- Lady Bird calls her brother out on his nose rings and by the end of the movie the brother has cleaned up and got a job 

- all the little details that clue you in on Danny being gay - Wanting to go to France, curling hair, loving theater, etc

- a random girl at the start of the movie talks briefly about the theater directors wife leaving him and his daughter overdosing, and much later on the guy goes in to the hospital to talk to someone about what we assume is deep depression/suicidal desires 

I'm sure there are a few more and this attention to detail is not that atypical of good solid writing, but it did take a 2nd viewing to pick up on a couple of these for me. Great film.

EDIT: oh another one - lady bird defends her mom and tells Danny her mom loves her too much, and then a couple scenes later she bad mouths her mom and tells her ""sister"" her mom basically hates her. Nice little way to show the back and forth, complex relationship the mother and daughter have. Something doesn't have to be new to be good. Do you do everything you do to be surprised? To see something you haven't seen before? Those experiences are memorable, but are they the best? That's up to your tastes, but I don't think ""it wasn't surprising"" detracts from anything else you praised it for. 

And there were parts I found surprising. The reveal that Danny was gay was edited so nontraditionally, I found it really incredible. They didn't linger in that moment at all, it didn't feel cinematic, they cut it how that moment would feel in real life. That was very interesting to me, and I think the film made lots of interesting choices like that. Maybe you went in too hyped, the 100% RT score and all that. But if every single critic gives something an 8/10, that's a pretty goddamn amazing feat. It's a 9 or a 10 for me, but even so, I think coming out feeling negative about it just because other people felt so positively about it is the wrong way to think about it.  > My experiences in high school were nothing like Lady Bird's, and while I can empathize with the character, it was hard for me to relate.

I don't think it is the similarity of the high school experiences that make this so relatable for people.  I think there are two main coming of age themes in the movie that a lot of people can identify with.

The first theme is that life is happening somewhere else and you are missing out on it.  Lady Bird wants to move from California to New York or even Connecticut which is a fun reversal of a lot of the California fetishizing you see in movies.  It is an obvious grass in greener situation and shows her immaturity.  I think a lot of people who grow up in smaller towns and can't wait to move away can relate to this.

The second theme is what really sets the movie apart in my opinion.  It is having ambitions for your life that you struggle to meet.  Lady Bird sees the life her parents have and wants something better for herself.  But she never really considers that her parents also wanted something better for their own lives (realizing your parents are people with their own hopes and dreams is one of the biggest experiences of becoming an adult).  This struggle for success is hit on multiple times with Lady Bird and her mom discussion in the bathroom and again when shopping for prom dresses.  Most movies would present this simply from Lady Bird's perspective.  However this movie give her mother just as much thought.  It is therefore relatable from both the child and parent perspective and the result is that a wider range of people can identify with it. It isn't really about doing anything new. It's how wonderfully executed everything was. I thought the film did a great job allowing Lady Bird to be awful but also redeem herself in unexpected ways. Everytime I thought the film was going to fall into those typical coming-of-age trappings, it would subvert my expectations. > it might have been intended/best interpretted as a way to show the ebb and flow of time, emotion, and relationships between Lady Bird and the people in her life. The movie doesn't take place over a very long period of time, but months do pass, and to some extent the editing may have helped to convey that feeling that in some way we *are* seeing varyingly independent vignettes over a transitional point in her life.

It almost seems like a recounting of memories later in life. Lady Bird, now in her early 30s, thinks back on her senior year. A lot of the fuzzy details are forgotten, but the things that really matter, or were really special, stick with her. Lying about her math grade, having sex for the first time, getting ice cream with her dad when he didn't get a job. I felt like I was on the Sacramento subreddit with all of the Tower Bridge shots, but I'm in agreement with you. Seeing it at the Tower was great! Funny, I had a similar experience.. watching it in NYC with some of the shots near the end very close to where I was watching the film [Hey, that’s not fair... uh...](https://media.giphy.com/media/9t6xpYZ9npJmM/giphy.gif) What a douche. Oh wait I thought she said I’m not ready to have sex and he said yea me neither I expected that too especially during the drive to prom. Thought they weren't going to drop her off and were going to do something terrible to her. Jenna seemed to be genuine friends with Christine up until she found out about the lie with the house she lived in. I thought it was pretty realistic for high school. Jenna let Lady Bird in for a little bit to her clique until she figured out that LB lied to her about where she lived, and that just wasn't cool to her. Short-lived friendships are pretty common in high school, especially towards the end when you start getting bored with the people in your clique. My senior year I remember talking to and hanging out with people I had never really did anything with during the 3 years before senior year. I believe it was depression. There's the earlier scene where he breaks down crying, followed by one of the girls talking about his teenage son dying. Plus, it's mentioned at one point that Lady Bird's mom works at a psychiatric hospital. Yes he probably and he didn't rely on God for support despite a priest/father. And the rumor shared early in the film about his family dying before he took the cloth.  Feel like I’m taking crazy pills, or everyone else is! What type of art do you like? Because for me (and a lot of movie fans I know), art that finds truth in ordinary life can be fascinating and poignant, which is what I like about this movie. That’s like, your opinion man. I mean, it was a good movie, I’m not hating on it. I just don’t see it as any kind of ideal movie. And I wouldn’t say it was fully authentic. Aside from the Lady Bird thing, other things didn’t ring true for me. Her screaming fight with her friend at school and yelling about her friend’s mom’s boob job, her cool boyfriend was too edgy, she was too ashamed of her house. Like I’ve never met anyone who lies for no reason about where she lives, like that’s not gonna come back and bite her in the ass. She’s a pretentious, unremarkable, rebel-light, as I suppose many of us are at that age, but I didn’t like her and so the movie never really drew me in.  A+ use of Dave Matthews though.

But hey, different strokes. I think there’s room on the thread for both of our opinions.  That's not quite fair.

It's also hyped because it has gotten universal acclaim from critics. A.O. Scott of the New York Times called it ""big-screen perfection."" 

 > I had been preparing for closure with the tearful goodbye at the airport.

Would you consider that if we had got that ending, it'd had been an ending we've already seen many times? I felt it was a welcome surprise to a cliche ending.  Can you explain a bit more why you thought the mother in the film was abusive? She seemed damaged and incapable of the kind of warmth her father was, but I don't know that that strikes me as abuse.  I agree with you there. It’s the one thing that bothered me. She’s fully aware her mother doesn’t treat her like a normal mother should, but she reads a few letters and is all “oh thank you so much.”

If it were me, I’d be like oh hey Mom why can’t you say this to my face?? This was my take. At the barest bones, it serves as a wake up call to her. Jesus, that makes me even sadder.  I wished they'd gone in-depth about this character or why he was in the psych hospital.

One of the girls mentioned his son (daughter) dying from a drug overdose and I think that's right after his crying scene. I was upset we never saw him again outside of the hospital scene.

Or why he's replaced by the football coach for The Tempest. Was that what was going on there. Didn't really understand what his problem was or why that scene was brought up. It was never really touched upon later. It seemed a bit tangential at that point.  A parallel of the mother comforting her daughter just as Lady Bird comforted Danny. Also referenced in the final scene of Lady Bird driving and then her mother driving on the streets in Sacramento. These both symbolize how similar they are to each other, truly mother and daughter. Loved his role in The Big Short. Just wanted to comment the exact same thing you did, and again, a month after you left your comment! pretty neat.

That line hit me hard. Pretty sure I'll have to rewatch this movie because I feel like there were so many more hidden pearls that I wasn't paying close attention to that probably will make the experience so much better.  My theater literally flooded from all the tears and mucus coming out of my body. I'm not even joking, they did an emergency evacuation and it was in the news. I just watched it, and to me it seemed to show that she was out of place. The drinking was just to get her into the hospital, where she saw the kid with the eyepatch. Seeing him showed her that she didn’t belong in that hospital, which was a parallel showing that she didn’t belong in New York, she belonged back in Sacramento. Just my two cents.  He's the one charachter that I couldn't empathize, but still found him totally believable. I also just saw Call Me By Your Name two days ago and he plays a much more grounded, realistic personality. It's awesome how different he is in both movies We were saying hella in middle school back at the turn of the century. It's in our blood. Born in 86 I’ve been saying hella tight since elementary school. (Not trying to sound cool,  but I remember my older cousin always saying it, and copying him.) The song Hella Good by No Doubt was released in 2001 so yeah it was in use a year later for sure.  I'm the exact age as the characters in the movie and can confirm with a resounding HELLLAAAAAAA I knew a Californian girl who was saying it regularly around 2004 at the latest (and long after that). So I can confirm it is at least that old. The people's history of the United States is an entry level ""this is what REALLY happened"" history book, one of those you'd get from a teacher that wasn't quite on board with the schools sugar coated curriculum but didn't want to go fully away from it. It's a book choice that fits in really well with the character of Kyle, sort of an ""of course he'd read that"" moment And vice versa. You almost believe him when he says it so casually. #whodrewthedicks That what I felt about the abortion joke scene. I mean, she got punished, but I thought it was going to lead to not getting into college. For me, it was because it sort of parallels the love we get from our parents, which does not strike us at first as being obviously love??

 I was thinking the same thing. I wish I knew the exact quote. My recollection:

“It seems from your writing that you really love Sacramento.”


“I guess I was just paying attention.”


“Wouldn’t you say that maybe they’re the same thing? Love and attention?” I think this movie is better than Brooklyn. Saoirse really leveled up in this movie.  The Big Sick is relatable to anyone with pushy parents, or frankly anyone who has experienced a relationship (male or female). But it's especially relatable to people with pushy immigrant parents, even if they're not Pakistani like Kumail's family is. I don't really think that there's any male or female slant since Kumail wrote it with his wife, even though it's from the male perspective it's pretty gender neutral in terms of storytelling. It would be pretty easy to gender swap the roles if they wanted to. 

Not really sure why you're passive-aggressively trying to lump me in as the ""average reddit male"", Lady Bird was clearly written from a female perspective. It's a very narrow slice of life movie about a very specific kind of person growing up in a particular time in American history, and as a period piece (weird to say about a movie set in like 2002 but nevertheless...) it makes specific references to people growing up in that era. It's a movie about what it was like for Greta Gerwig to grow up in a post-9/11 Sacramento Catholic school. Don't get me wrong, it portrays that topic very well, thanks in large part to its performances, I just don't know if what the characters are going through is meant to speak to me personally outside of the more general ""parents just don't understand"" kind of thing.

Like, the scene near the end of The Big Sick where [Kumail is leaving for New York and has a moment with his dad, but his mom won't come out of the car because she's still super mad at him](#spoiler) hit me really hard, man. That was a perfect representation of what it feels like to have immigrant parents and how they react to their kids dropping the traditions they tried bringing over to North America. And while it's a moment between ['Twas the butlerfather and son](#spoiler), I don't think you need to be a [son of a father](#spoiler) to relate to it, because it also reminded me of shit my sister's gone through with my parents too, and [I've been in similar situations like that where the parental roles have been reversed and it's my dad's that's pissed and my mom consoling me](#spoiler). So I really don't think it's a gender thing.

Whereas in Lady Bird, it's very much about a daughter's relationship with her parents. The closest I came to relating to that movie is seeing basically exact conversations I've witnessed my sister have with my parents, and I know for a fact that it's really not the same thing for boys. Greta is unabashed about it being about her experience as a woman, and from a narrative perspective it's one of the film's strengths, because it's uncompromising, and I don't necessarily need to relate to the characters too much to see that, but for me it just takes it down from like the 9/9.5 that it seems to be for a lot of people to like an 8, because it's like I'm looking at it from the other side of a window, peering into this house, and it makes me feel more detached from the story than I probably could have been. 

Does that make more sense? I tweeted her asking her to tell Tracy I loved his performance and she liked my tweet! Bro, that hospital scene... onions bro, onions Just be glad it's not Bakersfield or Fresno. But yeah. I'm usually in Sacramento once or twice a year and after growing up in the Midwest I agree. The biggest difference is being only about two hours away from SF. Most of the Midwest isn't even remotely close to someplace decent. As in she is constantly on the move to provide for her family, much as a Mother Bird would provide for her Lady Bird? > Lady Bird did a pretty good job of making the experience seem almost realistic

The sex scene perfectly encapsulates this for me. It’s not some steamy, drawn-out, 5 minute-long fuck fest. It was 5 seconds and then she has a nosebleed right after – nothing sexy about that. The entire film just felt very authentic to me in every way.  So her mom is like your mom.

Going into debt but guilting and shaming you for it?  
Trying to literally stop you from going to college by not filling out the school paper work, discouraging you from applying, and then when you are accepted to a college... Your mom doesn't talk to you for months and you have to apologize.

A parent who can't parent, even though she could to her son. A woman that can't say anything nice, even though she is show to do so to literally everyone else .

 Comforting her after she lost her virginity... you mean the scene where the female teenager is yelled at for shutting the bathroom door during a shower, then a parent comes into the bathroom with their nearly naked adult child?

Do you know why the first scene is like that? why ladybird LITERALLY throws herself from the car? she has no control. this child has no control in what happens in their life, they don't even get to control someone busting into their room.  This mother then BLAMES the child for the parent's own actions.

ok, here is something fun. What bad things does lady bird do?   

 I wish I could love my future wife and kids even half as much as he does. The scene where he congratulates his son left me speechless. This father was full of love even when he was struggling. I loved him swallowing his pride while also showing it in his son and  wishing him luck at the job interview that they both were applying for Armond White HATES Noah Baumbach. He once said his mother should have aborted him. They have a longstanding feud. Poor examples.  Seven percent of critics gave *Meyerowitz Stories* a bad review (which is not a lot, but it is also far from being the lone dissenting voice for *Toy Story 3* or something), and *Tom of Finland* has a **54** on Metacritic. It's not a movie I could ever re-create myself. It's a masterclass in writing, directing, and editing. Really from a truly creative mind.  The fantasy part doesn't really play a large role in the film, so I doubt you'd be bothered by it. It's just a beautifully made movie about the kind of subjects you'd never really stop to think about otherwise. I actually don’t think this is what OP of this comment is talking about at all. To me, all of that seemed obvious. There were a few things that were a bit more subtle, if you ask me. 

For me, Gerwig set up a few things that were there for the audience to decide. Her criticizing Miguel for his piercings and then him not having the piercings didn’t scream subtle, in my opinion.  

Maybe /u/MarcusHalberstram88 can clear up what he or she means?  > all the little details that clue you in on Danny being gay - Wanting to go to France, curling hair, loving theater, etc

And, you know, not touching her boobs...  Hahaha. Couldn’t agree more about the non traditional editing. There were so many moments like him being gay that I thought would dominate the next part of the movie, but then it just kept moving on.  but he hasn't lied in 2 years And a 2 pump chump to boot > Like I’ve never met anyone who lies for no reason about where she lives

Seriously? Poor kids at private schools are in situations like that constantly. I 100% knew kids who would be dodgy about saying exactly where they lived, or get dropped off a block away so the rich kids didn't see their parent's shitty car. I guess you can knock it for whatever you don't like, but that part is undeniably a thing that happens.  It's possible that the ending would have felt  a little too perfect if it ended at her departure. It's just a weird feeling when your internal clock and experience with movies tells you that the plot is likely wrapping up only to find yourself in a new situation. The movie uses the final New York scenes to good effect, it's just a little disorienting and left me aware of the real passage of time within the theater.

Also, I found those final Sacramento scenes ridiculously difficult to watch with dry eyes, which is *not* a common problem for me and I may have just been overwhelmed past the point of enjoying the promise of more story. I was seriously ready to tap out lol  The using guilt to manipulate, and control is a clear red flag of abuse. That shit is textbook emotional abuse. She seemed very loving, caring and involved in her daughters life, dunno what's your benchmark is, guess your mothers were better than mine if you think that was very manipulative and not warmth or caring. 

the lack of boundaries and wanting to make a drama of everything is what i noticed more.  I think it was another parallel between Lady Bird and her mother. They're accepting of taboos (homosexuality, mental illness) that exist in a more conservative environment and promise to not tell anyone, and to their credit they don't. Remember when he cried so quickly at the drama practice, and the girls were talking about how his son had died of an overdose which might have been a suicide?  My guess is he tried to kill himself. Really? The whole im spiritual and don't use cell phone things is pure posturing. He thinks he is deep when he is really just a pretty dummy. I did love him in Call Me By Your Name though.  his dad is dying from cancer though, did you all miss that. maybe he actually doesn’t give a shit about things because his dad is dying?? I know who Howard Zinn is. I just don't find him particularly funny so much as an important beginning read for anyone who considers themselves a leftist. I see. Maybe that’s why it hurts as an adult, because of how much attention someone did or didn’t get from their parents. For me, your suggestion is the most relatable. I wish I knew! I've been asking around and the best answer I got was that the nun was probably very wise, and said one of those zen things that seems so obvious, but is actually enlightening because of its simple life truth. I don't know why that quote about love and paying attention hurt the way it did, but I want to understand. I want to know why! I've been a fan since Hanna and she's just been getting better and better. Well in the movie it was more about Christine trying to escape Sacramento to find her own way and her mom not wanting her to move away so far. Her mom was happy when she got into Davis. My mom was reluctant to let me go away for grad school but she eventually accepted it. 


My mom is less abusive and can actually be nice to me but she has cold streaks and shuts down with communication too. Not parent of the year by any regard but not as bad as it could have been. > Comforting her after she lost her virginity... you mean the scene where the female teenager is yelled at for shutting the bathroom door during a shower, then a parent comes into the bathroom with their nearly naked adult child?

I don't recall a scene occurring this way in the film, but I will look for it on my re-watch. I believe that after the mother consoles Lady Bird in the car, they went to real estate open house showings, rather than the scene you are suggesting.

> Do you know why the first scene is like that? why ladybird LITERALLY throws herself from the car? she has no control. this child has no control in what happens in their life, they don't even get to control someone busting into their room. This mother then BLAMES the child for the parent's own actions.

Your belief that she has no control in her life stems from the remainder of the movie, but sequentially, the first scene occurs first chronologically. Your impression of her situation in the events following are clouding the way that you view the first scene.

I also disagree with you that this is the reason she jumps out of the moving car, but there is plenty more for us to discuss beyond this and I worry that I may run out of characters.

> ok, here is something fun. What bad things does lady bird do?

Two and a half examples:

 * Tell her father to drop her off at school a block away so she is not seen with him.

 * Leave her friend ""Julie"" behind to become friends with the popular girl Jenna. Arguably, her intent in becoming friends with Jenna is solely to have an opportunity to become closer to Kyle, and therefore, she can be seen as manipulating Jenna (also a ""bad"" thing).

I don't understand the reason why you are asking this question.

To respond to [your other reply here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7doxvl/official_discussion_lady_bird_spoilers/dsd7vtk/):

> I present a ""one-sided"" view because we have a grown woman acting shitty and a teenager acting like a teenager/adult.
>
> What do those crumpled letters say? do you remember? ""I got pregnant with you young"". it is an excuse.

If you look closer, you will see that the letters profess how much the mother loves her daughter. The parents adopted Lady Bird's brother Miguel because they believed they were unable to conceive a child naturally. However, when the mother became pregnant with Lady Bird, she writes in the letter that she viewed it as a miracle.

Look at Lady Bird's own reaction to reading those series of crumpled, unfinished letters. She smiles and calls her mother in an attempt to connect with her, asking how the mother felt when she received her driver's licence and drove on the Sacramento streets for the first time.

> and do you remember why the mother didn't actually finish the letters? ""ladybird would criticize my handwriting"". literally not something we saw ladybird do in the entire of the film. it is an excuse.

That may have been the excuse the mother gave to Lady Bird, but people do not always express their true intentions accurately in their own words. The father provides an alternative explanation, stating that the mother couldn't find the right words to truly express how she felt, and would rather not give a completed letter than risk misrepresenting her feelings. Indeed, the content of the letters (see above) seems to suggest the father's explanation is more true to the situation.

>The mother still has not accepted her role in acting like a shitty parent or a shitty human being, and hasn't tried to change that. she has put that burden on ladybird.

We are in agreement that the mother is not always a good parent, but again, you are presenting a one-dimensional view of her. I've provided plenty of examples already why that may not be the case. Here is another: Did you wonder why Miguel's girlfriend seems to live with the family? As she tells Lady Bird, the mother took her in after her own parents threw her out. This shows some level of compassion on the part of the mother, and Miguel's girlfriend tells this to Lady Bird expressly to convey this to her (and by extension, to the viewer).

> ladybird, a girl whose mother hasn't talked to her for months, is 2000 miles away from home, in a completely new place and experience. Her mother, at home, in the same experience but without ladybird. Who has to reach out? ladybird. the child.

Agreed, I believe the mother should have reached out first to her daughter, especially as Lady Bird/Christine is in a completely new location.

> and that driving stuff has more to do with control of the situation. Ladybird hated the place when she didn't have control...but when she was actually given space to find her independence, she found that she liked the place through the rosetinted glasses. It actually shows that the mother, through her lack of understanding of dealing with other human beings(you know, outside of her work as a nurse) pushed her daughter away.

That may have been your interpretation of the ending, and the purpose of Lady Bird's question about driving in Sacramento. However, I (and many other comments in this thread) believe that the message is one of hope, of reconciliation, of understanding the meaning of home. ""Rosetinted glasses"" is often used as a disparaging metaphor, but in this instance, it should not be. Lady Bird/Christine has a new perspective and appreciation for Sacramento, a new belief in Sacramento as not just where she was raised, but as her home town, emphasis on *home*. There's even a dig at him in his Lady Bird review:

>and she dates theater enthusiast Danny (Lucas Hedges), then self-involved Kyle (Timothée Chalamet), who reads Howard Zinn, subscribes to hipster conspiracy theories, and bears a hilarious resemblance to Noah Baumbach.
 If that’s the case why is he being made to write reviews for Noah’s film  I think the film is supposed to be set in 2003, based on those stupid new years glasses a guy wears at one point in the movie. Definitely a much different time in terms of social acceptance. Her mom works at a psych hospital so that makes sense He uses a cell phone when they skip out on prom too, just to underscore how full of shit he is. No yeah, he's dumb as hell. I meant believable in the sense that there are people like that in real life, especially high school Honestly, I knew a few guys exactly like him. Used to think they were deep/cool too.

I cringed so hard whenever he uttered any sentence. Maybe because somewhere in the back of your mind, it feels familiar. It reminds you of all the times where you've allowed yourself to be a little bit off in front of people you've cared about, but they've neglected to notice because they have their own busy lives, and their own problems to shoulder. But it still hurts a little because you think that if the situation was in reverse, you would have noticed, and you would have paid them that little extra bit of attention that wouldn't have taken too much time out of your day at all. 

Or maybe I'm just projecting? :P  Dont forget Atonement and she still plays the same age.  Well, the father still had to fillout and give the student loan information to Christine, while keeping it hidden from the mother.

the question I had still stands. Why did the mother get mad at Christine?  Was it for healthy reasons or reasonable reasons? on a level to 'eh' to 'very hurtful' how was the mother's reactions, how do those action equate to the situation at hand.

Did the mother actually value the relationship?  
What did the mother do to mend the bridge?

I am sorry if I came off shitty, I just keep getting people trying to downplay the level of abuse in this film by saying, ""my mother was just like that, everyone's was""... and many seem to forget what they mother did and the reasons.
 Dude! While doing my imdb research after watching the movie and seeing that Gerwig and Baumbach almost co-directed or whatever and are dating, I went to his imdb page and was like ""he totally looks like Kyle."" Why is he writing reviews in the first place.. She literally says at the start 'the only interesting thing about 2002 is that it's a palindrome'. I didn't really understand the importance of setting the story in that year. They frequently showed images of the Iraq war, but I don't exactly know what the literary importance was. I guess to heighten the uncertainty and fear Christine and her mother felt about the changing times. I didnt like the ""maybe I got in easier because of 9/11 and terrorism"" thing. Seemed out of place and shoehorned.  I have to say, those glasses were way out of place. I come from a lower Middle Class family and we would never have those cheap, use-once holiday props because we didn't have money to spare on frivolous antics. Anybody else? She plays a 13/14 year old in Hanna and she's 17 in lady bird right? Oh, don't get me wrong. It was definitely shitty and unreasonable but both of them acted that way. Christine learned it from her mom but people act unreasonable and shitty all the time without thinking about it. 


Her mom isn't thinking about these things and is selfish about it but she isn't intentionally trying to harm her daughter. It's layers of personality defects that turn a decent person into a terrible parent. 


I admit to having these kind of fights with my parents and that I need to be the one to be reasonable. Because it's the only way to move forward and be better than they were. Otherwise I perpetuate the cycle. I'll deal with unreasonable people all my life but I can grow to be better at it and do more than just scream at each other. And if you keep watching the movie they celebrate new years. I’m guessing it’s loosely based on the director’s childhood, and she’s 34, so she would’ve been graduating from high school around that time.  Nah. My fam was poor and we always had those. Buying the nicer, multi-use decorations was too expensive.  so, how did ladybird/Christine act unreasonable?

why was the mother acting that way about her daughter but not about her husband, or even her son?

her son, that didn't have a job, didn't dress in an appropriate way, was under her roof?

the mother asks the father if the son and his girlfriend have sex on the pullout.  The mother doesn't knock, walks right in to a teenager's bedroom, right in on her in the bathroom... but hasn't walked into her living room while her son is there? That is a boundary issue.

I think the mother falls on the narcissist range. The nun shows actual maternal actions/feelings towards ladybird/Christine. 

now, contast how they react with her, and how she reacts to them. The nun understands the situation, sees the humor in it, and actually lays out reality, without screaming, with out threats, without blame. Ladybird/Christine actually listens.  

The mother forces the daughter to go to a religious school because of fear of the real world and then yells at her for the price of the school. That is more than just a bit shitty. if anyone said, ""hey, I want to take you to an amazing band and i'll pay the ticket"".... and then during the show you find that you don't like the band so much, if your friend should scream at you, ""why don't you appreciate this, I spend so much money"". they'd be a dick. How does ladybird react, like a normal teenager. ""ok, you want to keep bringing up how much this costs... fine, tell me how much it costs... come on, you keep asking me if I know how much, you tell me... then, after I get out of here, I'll pay you back and never have to see you again"".

The mother is only happy about the son because he came back home.  The mother sheltered the daughter so that she could never leave, never have her own life, and when threatened with having her own life... the mother cuts her out. like a parent and child cannot be separate people. if it took you that long to figure out the time period you weren't paying attention. Guess I was just poorer than you lmao  I don't disagree with 90% of what you said but Christine did have her communication issues too. Like you said, a lot of it was based on how her mother acted and she's a teenager but it was part of Christine's growth to become better than her mother. And her mother grew too as we saw with the airport scene. It's not much but we got some small development that really shows that she does care. 


It's abuse and narcissism, I don't deny that but it doesn't mean that Christine should actually cut her out. Her mother will grow from her absence and her son eventually moving out. She may never learn to really communicate with Christine but not every family needs to be broken by this level of problems. They probably still fight in the future but you can love your family despite the drama. no, we didn't see that the mother actually cared about her daughter. She had months. She did nothing. A written but unsent letter is for non-but the writer.

she realized that her daughter was leaving and she wasn't getting that control back.

I don't think her mother will grow at all like I said, she had months and she didn't call, she didn't actually give those letters.

a woman terrorized her child, didn't give her privacy, tried to sabotage her going to college, and didn't actually help her child. it was selective too, no one else got as bad as treatment. 

just because a person popped you out, doesn't mean they get to shit on you and try to change your future to benefit themselves.

and bro, you just said it was abuse. you are advocating for an abused child to keep dealing with their abusive parent. 

that. that is the problem I have. a girl was abused but it is ok because it is her mother, and you only have one of those... so suck up that abuse, children!

27,"Fight scenes were cool. I enjoyed it, but missed the over the top goofiness Hitler and Lenin on the same team is peak western propaganda The final villain twist was absolutely nonsensical. How was >!Morton!< able to sneak off for presumably days or even weeks on end to do his evil villain meetings. Why is the ""flock"" following him? Why do they care abour scottish independence.

~~The Kingsman agency doesn't exist yet, but they already have a spy network set up for some reason?~~

Overall it felt way too unfocused and all over the place, first 30-40 minutes is just jumping through events and plot points, then the russian quest, then the 1917-like detour... it was just so weird. The Rasputin scenes were hilarious. The funny thing is Rasputin's actual death was way more ridiculous than what they came up with in this movie. From a quick browse of this thread, my opinion will be controversial, but I enjoyed it. Very different to the first two and quite glib and (successful or not at least attempting to be) poignant at times. I can see how this ultimately evolved in to the tongue in cheek Eggsy era. It felt like it created the necessary Monarchs losing their next of kin sadness to precipitate Kingsman’s founding. Also nice to see an actual effectual death in a universe where no one dies. It had its flaws and I will be honest I have a massive Gemma Arterton crush, but I can see what they were trying to achieve here. That no man's land scene was absolutely the highlight for me due to its suspenful structure and sheer brutality of it all like I did not expect the film to go that dark. Also the way Conrad died because of a misunderstanding just felt so insanely cruel and unexpected but it did serve well with showing how random and heart breaking war can be to anyone really. Great stuff 👏 Would love an explanation on how a spy ring that includes the king of England is supposed to be independent of governments. Omg this quote from  [the APNews review](https://apnews.com/article/film-reviews-entertainment-movies-julianne-moore-world-war-i-c3bd4ab4fb2dfb0efa732147e2902df1) had me dead

Spoiler >!At its heart, this is an origin story about a fictional spy agency that blames WWI and 20 million deaths on an embittered Scottish cashmere farmer. But this mysterious man, who is seen only in shadows until a big reveal at the end, is played like an angrier and more sadistic but no less ridiculous Fat Bastard!< Honestly if you turn your brain off and get ready for a popcorn flick—which is what I expect from Kingsman—it was quite enjoyable. I kind of love it when movies set around a certain historical event go so stupidly out of left field.

I mean this movie blames the entirety of WWI (and to an extent WWII) on a Scottish farmer wanting revenge on England. I feel like that alone should tell everyone that this movie is meant to be taken lighter than the feather they keep throwing about.

That being said, I agree with all the criticisms of this movie and would not recommend it to people lol


Edit: oh and I really liked the Rasputin ballet-fighting scene. That kind of ridiculousness gave me the Kingsman-ness I wanted from the film. This was like watching someone's fever dream about World War 1 but they didn't quite know World War 1 history or thought it was boring and started filling in the gaps with random stuff. Rhys Ifans as Rasputin was the best part about this film. After he dies, it's all downhill from there. I have to say out of everything the fact they read out most of “Dulce et Decorum Est” made it worth seeing for me. I laughed super hard at the Hitler stinger. I’m a bit surprised by the people who are so put off by the writing choices. It’s an origin story of what the founder wrestled with what a Gentleman truly is. I thought the son’s plight in the middle of the movie was essential to the father overcoming his difficulty. I know it wasn’t identical to the Kingsman that came before but I really enjoyed the movie as a whole. 

Only scene that didn’t do it for me was the the final formation of the society. Didn’t feel like they prepped for that moment enough. LMAO this review from the Washington Post: “Set against the backdrop of World War I and its origins, the film is essentially a trippier, more hallucinogenic version of an episode of “Drunk History” — one that might have been imagined (or dreamed) by a brainy but bored high-schooler who fell asleep during World History class after eating magic mushrooms” My mom gave it a 10/10

We have watched some of the greatest movies of all time so I was happy I finally found a 10/10 for her. I'm so happy this is finally out so I can stop seeing the trailer before every movie I see. I get they wanted to promote it but at some point, show a different trailer. While I don’t think the twist with Morton was that great, I will say the marketing and film did a great job at having me really believe that Aaron Taylor Johnson was the big bad, from having him in **zero** marketing, the big bad being hidden in shadows, and the voice in the trailers and in the movie until the reveal, sounding like ATJ doing a thick Scottish accent **plus** his actual character showing up and being Scottish. 

Very early on it was clear Morton was a baddie, but wasn’t expecting him to be the actual main villain, so yea. 

Anyways I enjoyed it for what it was. Rasputin was great and I thought all of the good guys were genuinely great. Loved Shola, Polly, and Orlando. No Man’s Land was brutal with that fight scene in the night being **wild** and I was not expecting Conrad to go out like that. Legit caught me by surprise. It was a very bizarre choice to go from Rasputin trying to give Voldemort a blow job to 1912. God I hope Kingsman 3 is as fun as the first one. Who all was at the table at the formation of The Kingsman? Conrad getting shot in the head that way so suddenly was a very shocking moment. The son’s war adventure and death totally stunted the movie and served little purpose to the narrative. It derailed it from a fun action flick to this random conflict with little weight. The dad’s bummed for like 2 mins and then it tries to go back to the fun action romp tone.

Just a weird choice in direction. I was really impressed by the no man's land scene. The setup of the knives only fight was interesting. But the aftermath of that where the kid breaks down after his first experience with actual fighting was surprising to see in a movie like this. The 5/10 are spot on. A lot of weird writing choices and general tone shifts make the film hard to really enjoy, but the saving grace remains spectacular actors (Charles Dance actually making me feel something like sadness for fucking Kitchener of all people, surprised even me) and fun action sequences. The Rasputin scenes were crazy and amazing and probably the most ""Kingsmen"" part of the entire film. The WWI stuff was pretty standard fare but the fight in No Man's Land was spectacular in its brutality. Just a lot of wasted potential in the story and setting. A Kingsmen film set in the 1920s with more weird gadgetry that actually showed us a budding ""spy agency"" with similar characters would have been more enjoyable than a lot of the plot dragassery of this.

On the note of Conrad, I think a lot of people will dislike the character, which is fair, but I appreciate that his entire character is one giant trope destruction. The trope is that arrogant young rich English kid insists he is prepared for war (very common in actual England at the time), goes to war, and has the realization that actually all the old people were right and war is hell and he therefore becomes a much better man for it. The character is played straight to the trope right up until, well, war is hell, and he gets shot in the face by his own side after amazing heroics. Perfect. Excellent takedown of that. Sometimes there is no ""I am wiser now"" arc because the world doesn't work that way. Sometimes you just die in a stupid, pointless manner, which essentially encapsulates so much of WWI. All that said, not sure a wild action romp was really the place to deliver that message but here we are. Not quite what I would've expected for an ""origin story"" of how the Kingsman agency came to be. Not that I would've wanted a bunch of forced wink-wink, nudge-nudge references (the codenames covered that anyway.) 

The tone and pacing was a bit all over the place with them trying to recreate this silly, fictionalized account of WWI. So much time is spent on exposition of how this country interacts with that country and this person's relationship with that person and how it ALSO affects the war. Don't get me wrong, in theory that stuff is all really interesting and I wouldn't mind watching a movie about it. But in Kingsman? It just felt a bit out of place and like they were trying to do too much all at once; something that would require a 3 hour epic to properly do it justice, not your standard silly action flick. That all said though, I respect them for trying something different, especially with the more unique time setting.

My biggest disappointment was easily the villain, all that build-up for such a big letdown. Personally, I would've really preferred if Rasputin was the main baddie and that's kind of the vibe I got from the trailers buuuut I guess that's marketing for you. He was just so much more captivating and more of an interesting character as opposed to... angry Scottish man. Sure, they would've had to rewrite the story to make it work but it's not like they were going for 100% accuracy anyways. If anything I was expecting Ras to show up at the very end as a fun reference to how he supposedly didn't die even after being shot, stabbed, poisoned, etc.

They've still yet to recapture the real charm of the original film, it's easily the strongest of the three. This one was still fun but I'm hoping they manage to raise the bar a little next time. Loved the first one, didn't care for the 2nd, how does this one fit in? The whole movie should have been the newly formed Kingsman vs Rasputin. The main characters son dies in the great war which pushes him to form the Kingsman. He starts killing the people who pushed to start the war and Rasputin was the organizer of it all for name whatever reason you want.

The first attempt they poison him. Call it job done, mission over. They see news he's still alive and find him again and stab him and call it job done, mission over. They see he's alive still so they track him down, big big fight and they drown him in a river and as they are leaving Gemma Arterton shoots him in the head for good measure (or as he's rising out of the water). Call it mission done, job over. Make the Kingsman service official, roll credits How did people feel about Conrad? I really didn’t care for his character, and his death was ridiculous to me. He fireman carries a man across across a dead man’s zone under heavy fire, gets hit with a fucking mortar, but has the presence of mind and feels it necessary to lie about his identity? Did anyone else feel like they were watching British imperialist propaganda for half this movie? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills I left the theater buzzing. Thought it was a total blast!  But I see the RT score and a lot of these comments and I wonder what everyone else saw . Decent movie, didn’t feel like a Kingsman movie though. Where was the humor?

Didn’t understand why it turned into 1917 for the middle of the movie

Didn’t expect to see Rasputin licking Ralph Fiennes

I thought the villain guy was going to be Mike Meyers for sure based off his voice

6/10 Weird movie. I feel like if you can't balance the comedy, the emotion, the violence, the class, and the silliness like the first one you just end up with a tonal gumbo. This movie goes like thirty minutes with barely a giggle then it's time to laugh about how bisexual Rasputin is. 

I'll never complain about more Ralph Fiennes. He had to carry the weight of this movie and he was doing a fine job, as was the rest of the cast. The movie was kind of marketed on the Rasputin scene and that was fun, but short lived. The script overall is just so all over the place. 

I will say, the villain reveal was awful. It felt like it kept the actor from really putting forth a performance because they used so many shadow tricks and ADR to hide his identity, and then when it's revealed he's basically nobody. Like who even remembered that guy's presence? It's a damn shame because he was chewing the hell out of that accent and could have been a fun performance. 

It's fun that Vaughn did some historical fiction and it's not a bad movie per se. It just depends on what you want out of it. It's not terribly funny, but it has some fun action. It's not the heaviest movie of the year but it may surprise you with some emotion. But I'd imagine anyone looking for a glimpse of what made Kingsmen good will be disappointed. I kept waiting for them to assemble a team or make some gadgets but the closest we got to a climax was a sword fight in a goat shed. 

5/10.

/r/reviewsbyboner I can't believe Hitler is the Thanos of the Kingsman world. France just doesnt exist or something? I thought killing Conrad was a daring and great choice. Real gut punch. 

The ww1 scenes were actually pretty well done

A lot of the historical stuff was weird though, like it reminded me of FDR American bad ass.

The Hitler mid credits scene didn't need to happen. I just got out of the theater, and I thought this movie was fine, but not exceptional. The acting and action were great, but the story structure seemed strange to me. The story doesn't seem to have a 3-act structure, nor doesn't it have a traditional hero's journey arc. Now that I think about it, this might be the first origin-story I've ever seen that doesn't have a hero's journey arc. 

The plot had some pacing problems, and the idea of WW1 being masterminded by a Scotsman upset with the English was silly. The action was very well choreographed though, the special effects were good, and the actors all gave good performances, so overall I enjoyed it. 

I saw the new matrix film last weekend, and this was certainly better than that. I thought it was alright. I was mostly entertained. I’ll never feel the need to watch it again tho. 6/10 

The whole sequence with Conrad in the war seemed like it was ripped out of another, much better movie, also damn, that one dude was quick with the trigger finger when he thought he was a traitor. 

I honestly had no desire to see this movie but had nothing better to do tonight and I have A-List. I’ve seen the trailers for 2 years now and was burnt out on it but it was better than I thought it would be. 

Obv the best part was Rasputin, so it was a bit odd to kill off the best character of the movie halfway through. 

I didn’t realize Matthew Goode was in this and playing Morton so i didn’t see the reveal coming. Though I just had my brain turned off by then. 

It felt like there was a much better WW1 movie buried in there that we just got a glimpse of. That knife fight between the soldiers near the trenches was legit harrowing and probably the best part of the movie. I honestly thought it was pretty good. Seeing the fate of Conrad was a nice subversion to the old legacy inheritance I thought they wouldve pulled. In the end it was a fun historical fiction with a solid first half kind of setting up a solid premise and the second half going wild with it. I felt this movie had no direction. What the goal was changed from scene to scene. Characters were introduced and then killed off within two scenes. The reveal of who the Scotsman was was extremely anti climactic and very obvious. The plan also made no sense to me. Why is everyone on board with mr Scottish independence? Why did Zemo send the Zimmerman telegram even though that was completely contrary to their goals? Where even did the final fight take place? Sure as hell wasn’t Scotland but they never said where his secret barn lair was.

I also felt that they didn’t utilize the time period very well. The only time where it kind of mattered was when he jumped out of the plane with an early parachute, but even that wasn’t that exciting. The other kingsmen movies got bonkers, I would have loved to have seen them battle on top of a zeppelin about to blow up the queens palace or something. This movie doesn’t care about any other historical accuracies or details, so why not.

And finally, I could not give less of a shit about the origin of the Kingsmen. It kind of felt like the movie knew this too, because it felt extremely forced. Overall I thought it was a big let down. The tonal shifts in this film are jarring as hell. You go from a campy Rasputin slurping at someone’s leg and dance-fighting on tabletops to a young man weeping in the trenches as he realizes the horrors of war first hand—in the span of like 20 minutes. 

On the other hand, it certainly beat a history lesson about WWI into my head. “There were three cousins…” indeed. Okay key point reviews about this movie.

-Fucking loved every scene with Djimon Hounsou man. Kinda blown away that he’s so good in every movie he’s in but he’s always barely used

-some of the fight sequences were some of my favorite and least favorite of the series. While the No man’s land night fight was spectacular, i found the big mountain dude fight (while having a great finish) was really bogged down imo by how it felt really just “big dude can’t feel pain” is the entire gimmick.

-i loved all the “proto-kingsman” references in this movie, it felt way more organic than how some other prequels handled them. Like seeing the kingsman manor, how ralph fiennes’ flare gun looks to be what the kingsman sidearms are based on, etc

-the ending kinda just……happened. It felt like the movie was going at its own pace up until the ralph fiennes gets out of his slump and just solves the plot

-the villain twist was so bad imo. My brother literally leaned over after he came outta the shadows and went “who tf is that” 

-this movie felt an hour too long man. If they tightened up the story a bit and did more Kingsman stuff. It would of been great. 

All in all the movies okay but should of been about kingsman more. 7/10 I thought FOR SURE the Shepherd was going to be David Tennant.  That Scottish Voice sounded EXACTLY like his Scrooge McDuck! 

I did enjoy how many historical accuracies they used in this story.  Its rare to see the correct way Franz Ferdinand gets assassinated. The villain's roundtable containing Mata Hari, Gavrilo Princip and Rasputin pulled me in from the outset, then Lenin arrives, and then when Hitler hits in the credits sting?  Oh baby. Historical silliness done right.

Plus Tom Hollander playing 3 kings, lovely stuff Can’t believe Voldermort got his legussy ate by Rasputin. Was way more serious than the first two, almost to the point I wasn't sure I was going to make it through the first half. I can appreciate the story afterwards though and it did have some great fight scenes.

Who knew the best (IMO) fight scene would have to do with Russian ballet lol Rasputin was the biggest highlight of the movie, and the only portion that featured the over the top wackiness that Kingsman did so well in the original. 

Makes sense now why they plastered that character/fight all over the promotional material…people would be less interested if they found out that the movie was really just an LQ version of 1917. I liked it.  Not as good as the first 2, but I still enjoyed it.

I legit wasn't expecting Conrad to die.  I thought he was gonna be the first Galahad.  Although making Polly the first Galahad made sense.  She was the one that kept Oxford on the path.

Djimon Hounsou was the shit.  That's not a shock.

Nice little moment showing that the Kingsmen in part 1 had lost part of their way. Most outside of Harry and Merlin looked down on Eggsy for his background.  But when looking at the founding members, one was a soldier (Archie) and 2 were servants.  They'd more than welcome Eggsy.

Liked the mention of Statesman.  The butler was part of the Kingsmen spy ring, so maybe he plays a role in Statesman entering the spy business.

Rasputin was fun.  And of course Zemo is manipulating powers to fight each other. I thought the movie was good, but I they tried to fit a lot of stuff into this. Between getting to know characters like Oxford, Conrad, Shola and Polly, the Scottish villain, Rasputin, all those other baddies, the three cousins, the political intrigue, WWI, and a Kingsman origin all in one. It was just too much. Some of it worked.

Ralph Fiennes carried the movie on his back. He was great. Rasputin was definitely a highlight, and the film peaked in that awesome fight sequence with the 1812 Overture playing in the background. The No Man's Land stuff was great. Gemma Arterton and Djmon Honsou were good, but I felt like they should've had more to do.

The film did take a little dip in quality when Rasputin died. They almost got it back with the war stuff in the middle, but I feel like it never got that energy back. The climax was a sword fight in a barn against a villain we just met when all we saw was the back of his head the whole time. There was no weight to it at all, IMO.

I liked what they were trying to do with Conrad, and his death was sudden and shocking, but it wasn't devastating because I don't think he left that much of an impact for me to care. The villains other than Rasputin were pretty bland. I don't even know why they were following that guy, or what was in it for them. Daniel Bruhl was wasted, the American (?) Woman they had was just there, and the main villain reveal was underwhelming. 

I get what they were going for, but they tried doing too much. Solid movie still. Better than Kingsman 2 for sure. 

The origin is out of the way now. Instead of staying in the past, I like to see a movie covering Kingsman agencies in other parts of the world. Let's get away from the Brits for a little. A Statesman movie, or Japanese Kingsman flick would kick all sorts of ass. And as much as I like Matthew Vaughn and his work, let him take a break so we can see what another team can do with this franchise. I had a big problem with the performative anti-imperialism when the movie is basically pro-British empire. 

Lord Oxford denounces colonial activity, but then fights to ensure the survival of the oppressive regime. Which is it? Saw it last week, didn't mind the tone change. It was predictable due to being a prequel.

But it just felt flat. The characters were a little boring, especially the son of the main character. 

The promos that were selling Rasputin as the main villain almost made sense since he was by far the best part of rhe movie. 

Fuck it, give me a Rasputin spinoff. Walked out early on this. It sucked. A complete mess plot wise which is amazing considering they had two years of editing on it. It was all over the place and chaotic and I honestly loved all of it. The twist with the son was shocking, but it made sense considering the father felt like the true main character from the get go.

The guy stuck on the lift was such a small character, but soooo funny. Rasputin was MVP. His fight scene was off the walls. 

I don’t need a movie to “come together” if it’s not trying to. This one wasn’t. It just wanted to tell a wild story that ended with the Kingsmen being formed. It did a pretty great job. 

Excited for Tucci to hopefully be in the next oooone The last 20 minutes if this film, from the bi-plane sequence onwards, really clicked and showed what the film could have been. Up til then it was just a really weird tonal mess. 

Dear god though, I went to see Matrix Resurrections immediately after this and this film is *massively* better than MR. Two real examples of a filmmaker rebooting their franchise and producing a convoluted mess. I’m genuinely surprised how stacked the list of German actors in this film is. Oxford’s wife played Hitler’s secretary in Der Untergang (Downfall), then you’ve got Daniel Brühl and August Diehl, and Valerie Pachner who was in A Hidden Life (with Diehl) playing Mata Hari.

Even crazier how Brühl and Diehl are basically bit players, probably saving them for a sequel along with Taylor-Johnson and Tucci. I don’t know how well this film is performing but I would be down for that sequel. I guess in this movie's universe, France does not exist!

Never mentioned, isn't even on the map. For better or worse, the Kingsman franchise seems to reinvent itself with every new installment. And while I appreciated this more dramatic and political turn, I can understand how the tonal whiplash could throw off critics and audiences alike.

As a standalone film/origin story, I loved the introduction into this world. I also loved the way the Oxford family story unfolded with all its twists and turns. These were both supported by an incredible cast who brought their strong characters alive and played off each other in a very fun way.

But as the product of the American public school system, I was lost the entire time. Was this historically accurate? Would that even matter? I already know the Allies won; what's all this stuff going on in the meantime? What are the stakes? I just don't think that the American moviegoers were the target audience for this.

Still, I can appreciate the strong anti-war sentiments and the universal themes of family, country, and duty. Hope they can expand on this with another installment about WWII-- a more well-known war. I'd still give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 because it was so well-made. You should definitely watch it and judge it for yourselves.

P.S. Weird how the Kingsman Agency was more progressive a century ago... Can’t be the only one who thinks Conrad’s story arc was a disappointment? Kid was so desperate to go to war only to get killed by his own dumb mistake? Just felt pointless to me. There would of been more weight to his death if he was actually killed by the enemy. Idk… That spy traitor scene was shocking as fuck I’m now curious about a sequel to the prequel that is set up…but to see this kind of historical fan fiction treatment as a WWII movie? Tarantino did it but I can’t see it being pulled off twice No matter the varying opinions on the drastic tonal shifts in this movie, one thing it was was hella captivating from start to finish. Never a dull moment and definitely exceeded my expectations.

Also a really good choice to keep the series revitalised by sending it back in time for the origin story. A third instalment that similarly followed the second movie and Eggsy might've felt less fresh. It's been a while since I've seen the first two movies, and I wasn't really comparing them at all when I was watching this one. That's probably why I fucking loved it. Why did any of the villain members agree to be under Shepherd? I ultimately feel that the movie could’ve done more with being over the top. WWI is without a doubt one of the most absurd conflicts in history, there’s a good way of playing up the absurdity more than they did in the movie while still being respectful and carrying out a strong anti war and imperialism message. Give us more scenes with idiotic monarchs, Willy and Nicky are the best examples of dumb monarchs out there. Also I found the exclusion of France in totality completely odd in a movie set in WWI. Like not a single mention of anything French—they could’ve done something here I feel I absolutely loved it. I went in expecting a funny movie and I got a funny movie with some amazing action scenes. Some of you all have too high standards haha I can't wait to see it again - Rhys Ifans as Rasputin was great. Most entertaining part of the film.

- The sudden shift in tone to the deadly serious trench warfare was nice, I didn't think it was that jarring. I appreciated the subversion where he miraculously evades every bullet and explosion just to die so pointlessly over his own mistake. 

- Like a few films these days, it acts very confident of it's ability to get a sequel. Setting up or introducing characters and plots for no real narrative purpose other than to set up the players or events of a sequel.  

It was dull in parts and kind of a mess when it came to whether they were trying to be serious or over the top but overall it was entertaining enough 6/10. Did anyone catch who the movie was dedicated to at the end after the credits? I thought it said Henry Morton but I think I misread it and can’t find any information about him Surprised I enjoyed this film so much. Great movie. Enjoyed it so much. The pacing was a bit fast and messy at the start but it improves greatly. The highlights for me were the final scene with Rasputin and the No Mans Land sequence. I also loved the setting for the villains lair with the goats. The composers deserve a mention as well. The score was wonderful. 8.5/10 Saw this today, and I don't get the hate... I thoroughly enjoyed it. Sure, it has a different tone to the first, but that doesn't this film was not enjoyable as many people commenting make it seem. The entire no man's land scene felt like an entirely different movie. I legitimately forgot this was a Kingsman film.

I loved everything about the Rasputin scene though. i thought the whole flip on modern history (esp. portrayals of historical figures) was one big over the top goof. like a long elaborate joke instead of a bunch of one liners. I feel like we saw different movies. That was some of the goofiest shit ever This wasn't over the top goofiness? I must have been watching the wrong original Kingsman Pretty much sums up my thoughts. Action scenes are few and far between. But the few there are, they're done pretty well. I enjoyed them. But it wasn't as fun as the first movie. They only got introduced to each other, the movie never said they saw eye to eye or had any kind of camaraderie. The film literally starts with the British having a concentration camp in south Africa but they excuse the British empire by saying that the military wasnt informing the government properly, then later we are supposed to feel sad that the same military guy from south africa dies when the boat sinks. I'm surprised they didn't look right into the camera while shaking hands and say ""our ideologies are exactly the same"" I have no idea why the chose Hitler and not Stalin to be Lenin’s protégé It would have actually made more sense if there was a sequel in which came a new villain whose puppet was hitler, just to follow the mad and nonsensical logic behind this movie

but yeah Hitler going off the script is also quite pausible lol its just weird that Kingsman is slowly turning into this historical revisionist fiction Wait when did Hitler show up I’d agree if the writing was smarter but it’s more likely that the writers weren’t thinking about politics and just wanted to have major dictators team up because of how “cool” it would be I think if they had a Irish / IRA villain it would’ve made a lot more historical sense I liked how the villain went on about doing everything for the good of Scotland, and the film showed a Scottish battalion fighting and dying in the war he had started. Just proves how stupid his incentive was. Nearly everything he said was nonsense. [removed] I agree!  Why on earth is Rasputin bowing to some random dude who lives on top of a plateau?  What is this guy offering these people that they are all willing to kill themselves for him?  Without explaining that it’s pointless. >The Kingsman agency doesn't exist yet, but they already have a spy network set up for some reason?  


They don't, they set the network up as a precursor to the Kingsmen agency after the trip to Austria where the Duke was shot. I tend to go to movies blindly these days and only check IMDb page after seeing the movie, so I was really hoping the final reveal of the villain will blow me away. But then early death of semi-famous actor early in the movie got me thinking and I was like ""meh"". 

This plotline went through basic checklist without any regard to making any sense and the whole movie suffers from it. 

Action scenes were entertaining as ever. I love Mathew Vaughn's direction when it comes to popcorn action ever since Stardust. Yeah, that kinda possed me off. Considering how other characters die in the other two films they could've done so much more with Rasputin Fucking hell just read the Wikipedia article into his death. I thought all this shit about Rasputin was exaggerated for the movie!! Just read the Wikipedia entry on that, and the Corn brothers or the Veep/Death of Stalin should make a movie about that Actually, the tale of his death was GREATLY exaggerated by his murderers, to make him look like he was way more dangerous, instead of making them look so incompetent. I liked it as well. Tonally it's a bit messy, but I like what they did as far as tying in with historical events such as the assassination of Ferdinand and the legendary death of Rasputin via poisoning, stabbing, drowning, and shooting.

As well, it was neat to see Conrad face war for the first time and actually be traumatized by it once the adrenaline wore off. That sort of thing is rarely seen in blockbusters. Agreed I enjoyed it as well and would certainly see a whacky WW2 sequel then hopefully a 5th finale where Eggsy takes down this “Spectre” group. I really enjoyed it as well. I LOVE the previous Kingsman movies and I love Matthew Vaughn's movies, so I had a good idea of what I was getting into.
*Action scenes were fantastic, as expected. Beautifully shot and easy to follow.
*Ralph Fiennes was great as an action lead.
*Music was really good and the sound was excellent! I read the top comments and I was like “wow these people had almost the opposite reaction as me” 

As for me, I enjoyed the movie. I think it made sense that there was less humour since this was the time where thd agency was not yet even incepted. Everyone just lost someone important too. 

I also love how the scenes also created the need to develop “gadgets” like when he attached knives in his shoes and the parachute. While i loved that entire section of the movie, wtf were those germans man? Lol conrad was fighting a normal dude then a heavily armored juggernaut appears and my brother leaned over to me and said “boss fight” 😂 One of the ballsiest plot turns I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie. This is how I felt as well, surprised to see others not liking it. I get that they want consistent tone, but as a third movie I feel like you have to do *something* new, and this movie did. It caught me totally off guard. My bf and I thought both father and son will be the pioneer of Kingman agency. When Conrad survived the battle, I thought he would go back and change his mind. The scene escalated quickly from 10 to 100 and there he died. >the way Conrad died because of a misunderstanding just felt so insanely cruel and unexpected but it did serve well with showing how random and heart breaking war can be

True, but it felt from another movie entirely. This is like a Pee-wee Herman movie where in the third act he gets kidnapped and graphically tortured by a serial killer. That was a very odd part to me. We’re going to start this spy ring and have to include the King and the US Ambassador you’ve seen for two seconds and is secretly Stanley Tucci How do you think the king of England would take it when a duke called himself Arthur in your presence The King of England isn't really in the government, he's the embodiment of the State. The government is Whitehall, parliament, the Prime Minister, etc. No private intelligence agency can operate without at least the implicit consent of its home government. If they were really independent, MI5 would be all over them for spying on the British government and it’s allies.

Having the King’s patronage, at least at the start, provides them with the legitimacy and support needed to operate. 

But overall, I agree with you. It wasn’t a well-written movie. The moment I saw dude on screen I knew he was a villain, but not to that extent. 

Then the moment they gave him a scene to step outside and spent the whole time focusing on Dance, I knew it had to be him 100%

.....strange that a sheep farmer and his weird animal interests somehow managed to orchestrate WW1.....because he was angry over Scotland. Not to mention that the Black Watch are pussies compared to the sheltered son of an English duke, and then kill him in a friendly fire accident. Some studio was like ""you know what's a lucrative IP? WW1. But we gotta make it sexy,we need some baddies and we need some heroes,yeah that's it"" So…a super immature man baby like Mathew Vaughn? He was soooooo good in this role, intimidating and truly unrecognizable. I wanted so much more of him. 

That Russian dance coupled with his swords was honestly the best thing about the film and made him look soooo badass and intimidating. 

Honestly I wished it was all about him. holy fucking shit he transformed for this part, had no clue. He should've been the MAIN villain, he has a unique fighting style and was by far the most menacing villain!

The movie took a while to get going and then ERUPTED at the Rasputin scene...it peaked to early though as it never reached the heights of that scene in any sense. That scene was weird, unpredictable, and genuinely thrilling....just like the first kinsman.

I HATED the twist with the Scottish main villain in the end, it seemed very cheap. They pulled the same bullshit they did with Channing Tatum in the trailers for Kingsmen 2, make it seem like he plays a prominent role only to be barely in the film at all In fact, it is all downhill, both before and after the fight with Rasputin, as that is about the only thing that brought this movie to live for even a few minutes. Apparently the poem wasn’t published until 1920 so I have no idea how Lord Oxford obtained it in 1917 but yea I agree it was a cool scene lol. I wholeheartedly agree with you. It truly was poetic and incredibly fitting. My younger brother and I picked up on the poem from the first few lines. English Literature classes back in secondary school came in use! Was there a post-credits scene? Right after that scene should have been the caption:


Hitler will return I was so confused why they cast the rather famous german actor David Kross to kill the Romanovs in 5 seconds but mention him in the main credits, well, now I know... I know right? Holy shit, I hope that was meant to be funny. Fully agree. I thought it was a well told story and that each story arc contributed to the plot while remaining quite entertaining. Defining why the protagonist chose to form the organization in the first place. Plus I thought all the action scenes were very entertaining. 

It puzzles me that I see conflicting criticisms coming to the film. Many found the film too dry/serious for the series. Others thought it was too silly & over the top. Frankly this  would make it nearly impossible to please both conflicting sides of the audience Does she likes the first 2 As someone who sees three movies a week, I had the same thought when it started tonight.  Like, ""Now I won't have to see the trailer again!"" I'd rather see that than the fucking crypto ad a hundred times. That’s how I felt about *Free Guy*, and I was seeing trailers for that back in January.. of 2020. Why are boys so messy? I was genuinely convinced I was going to see a bald David Tennant at the end of the movie King George, polly, the duke of Oxford (did he have a real name?), Archie Reid (Scottish kid that reported Conrad’s death), shola, and I think the American embassy worker? Yeah it was. But the again, it's kind of a signature thing in Kingsmen movies. Killing off a main character in the middle of the movie. When I first saw the trailers for this, I thought the son would be coming home from WW1 and jump into the Kingsman thing with his dad from there, using his combat skills from war in the rest of the film.

What actually happened was just strange plot wise (him going to WW1 for 15 minutes doesn’t advance the plot at all) and doesn’t even work to develop Fiennes’ character because it’s so rushed and unearned to get to the anti-climatic climax. Strange choices all around here. It's tragic and ironic and would have served well for a twist in another movie. Like that's not really the tone of Kingsman at all. So if you're going to kill off a main character you should at least have it make a little more sense. Totally agreed. Could have skipped that entire part, had the son live and be one of the first Kingsman. Would have made more sense than random Scottish dude ending up as a member. It served a purpose to the basic plot - they needed a low point and so naturally he would die at some point to lead into the third act. 

Just the way they did it involved cutting away from the main story and not seeing Ralph Fiennes for like 15 minutes to basically making the son into the protagonist (and then kill him off randomly). Also... why does the guy who shot him not know what happened to his friend?

Conrad was *going by the guy's name*, so the guy would have found him. Did his friend not tell him they'd done the switch? Like, it just felt like such a forced way to kill him, right after they *didn't kill him*.

It came off like the only reason the explosion didn't kill him, was so  Vaughn could ""subvert expectations"", and then when he dies anyway ""hah! You almost thought we weren't going to kill him!"" It was directly inspired by 1917, I think. Especially the two sequences where he has to run for his life. > On the note of Conrad, I think a lot of people will dislike the character, which is fair, but I appreciate that his entire character is one giant trope destruction. The trope is that arrogant young rich English kid insists he is prepared for war (very common in actual England at the time), goes to war, and has the realization that actually all the old people were right and war is hell and he therefore becomes a much better man for it. The character is played straight to the trope right up until, well, war is hell, and he gets shot in the face by his own side after amazing heroics. Perfect. Excellent takedown of that. Sometimes there is no ""I am wiser now"" arc because the world doesn't work that way. Sometimes you just die in a stupid, pointless manner, which essentially encapsulates so much of WWI. All that said, not sure a wild action romp was really the place to deliver that message but here we are.

I like this take Agree on the Conrad point. When I was watching his dash to the trench, I kept thinking of how many people died in war due to friendly fire, and I was like “Well thank god this is a movie bc real life that dude would 100% be dead from the guns from his side”. And then he makes it, just to die from something even stupider. I do appreciate the point they were trying to make. I agree. I don’t know more people aren’t talking about how anti-war the whole movie is Charles Dance has an unprecedented screen presence. Every moment he's on screen he commands attention and I think he's a fantastic actor. Mostly agree with you, mediocre story but really good individual actors and the chaotic choreography was exactly what I was hoping for. The fight in No Man's Land felt like textbook Kingsmen, a really unique setup for a fight, regardless of how I think it fit into the story >On the note of Conrad, I think a lot of people will dislike the character, which is fair, but I appreciate that his entire character is one giant trope destruction.

Very much agreed.  
  
My only qualm, though, is that he still dies for a heroic cause by successfully returning the film canister leading to the US entering the war. And in tribute to him, the *King himself* along with the *best friend of the Scottish soldier who killed Conrad* become **founding members** of The Kingsman..  
  
Even when the film truly delves into the senseless death and delusions of war, it still just can't help being all patriotic and romantic about it 5 minutes later. Oh.

So basically you're saying I shouldn't go into it expecting an insanely over-the-top Tarantino-esque history rewrite where Anatasia lives and successfully defeats the Bolsheviks with a fleet of Tsar Cannons? Statesman was name checked *a lot* and now I’m intrigued. Which was formed first? I know Rasputin has been done before, and everyone knows the look, but he was easily the most interesting thing about the trailers, and I'm glad to see Ifans' portrayal is getting some love. Like it's only barely even related to the other movies. Complete tonal change. *I* loved it, but then I was a history/political science major with specific focus on Europe from pre-WWI to post-WWII 🤣 Matthew Vaughn apparently does not understand why we loved the first movie. It was amazing and the sequel was just a total letdown. I was hoping it was just sequel-itis but now I know it was the first movie that was the anomaly. Has very little to do with the Kingsman, doesn't have that soul at all. By itself it's ok, certainly not terrible but very forgettable. When you shoehorn in the Kingsman name it just stops making sense. I didn't even stick around for the credits scene, I just didn't care and was ready to leave at least 30 minutes before it ended. I've lost all hope for this series. A messy film that tries to be serious as well as a Kingsman film. It's really not very good as a whole even if it has a lot of good ideas and moments. I actually like this. Add some more bonkers-ness. You’re hired. When can you start? Holy shit. This is a movie I want to see. The entire plot of him wanting to fight dragged, and dragged. And then he dies for such a simple reason that it kinda makes you wonder if all that time spent on it was worth it I really disliked the character. 

At the start he was understandably in wanting to go fight with the rest of the troops. All ok. Solid character.

But then the Rasputin mission happened, and he knew clear as day, that he could help his “country” by doing said kind of missions with his father.

“Nooooooo! I have to go to the trenches to die in the mud and have a meaningless death.”

Well, good riddance. 
I kind of sighted with boredom when he also died so pointlessly and idiotic. 
(The guy he took the name, happened to have a friend on the exact same area….
1917 film showed us how maddening it was in those trenches. It was hard finding anyone like that) Conrad is a charisma blackhole. I was happy he died. Weakest part of the movie. They should have cut 30 minutes of him being a bitch, and start with the actual story > feels it necessary to lie about his identity?

He probably would have been shot either way. Either he lies and gets called out, or he tells the truth and nobody believes him because there's no records of a Lt. Oxford being shipped out, plus he's in a corporal's uniform. I only saw this movie because I am a fan of Harris Dickinson from other things. After the Golden Circle I had little hope for this movie being great, and setting it in WWI didn’t bode well for the lighthearted ridiculous spy shit from the first movie. This was like watching a fan fiction of All Quiet on the Western Front or something. War movies are inherently anti-war and this one was like being punched in the face with it. 

I was hoping Conrad wouldn’t die, but once I saw he swapped placed with another great actor (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) I basically said my goodbyes. This random Scotsman he picked out of the crowd happens to be a great actor and then introduces himself as Lancelot? Bye Conrad. Loved you. Tbh he spent the whole film wanting to go die in the war....atleat it paid off.... It's weird, with the opening of them visiting British concentration camps, the Duke of Oxford's backstory of vowing pacifism after committing atrocities for the empire, and the main villain being a Scot who wants to destroy England as revenge for English oppression, the movie seems like it's trying to interrogate the myth of the British empire being a force for good. This theme also ties into the son's desire to join the war. Is it a good thing to die for your country? Is serving your country a noble cause when your country is a force of oppression? The idea of the Kingmen could have come from the desire for an independent agency that wouldn't just enforce colonial power but prioritize saving lives, even if it went against the interests of your nation.

The movie raises these themes but then tosses them aside without much consideration, leaving them feeling like superficial additions that give the appearance of condemning British colonialism without tackling any of the hard questions related to that. And the idea that Kingsmen is an independent agency is laughable when nearly all the members have strong ties to a British nobleman and the bloody king of England is heavily involved. Not even British.

English.

The main villain is Scottish lmao Matthew Vaughn everybody The way they made Lenin and Hitler as allied illuminati figures was hilarious The entire premise is an ""independent spy agency"" that exists to protect the anglosphere You mean a movie titles the ""Kings Man"" isn't overly pro British? Shocker /s 100% found myself agreeing with the bad guy about the nobility and monarchy ruining the lives of the common people He did mention the fact the U.K. had concentration camps but I don’t think it was overly imperialist consider the theme of the film series. Not really - Arthur recounted that one of the reasons he was anti-war was because he had deep regrets about invading other countries and killing people who were just defending themselves. Same, I loved it, not as good as the first one but I thought it was still very charming and very wacky, I enjoyed it a lot. I'm with you, I'm pretty surprised it's not getting a lot more love.  I still really enjoyed it and is one of the few movies I'll get when it comes out. It was very distracting that the actor playing Conrad looked very similar to the main actor from 1917. Like I had to Google it during the credits to make sure they didn't do something so obvious. I wasn't expecting Woodrow Wilson to get a lap dance. Haha yes! I kept thinking “I bet they aren’t showing his face cause it’s Mike Meyers and no one would expect that so they are waiting for the big reveal at the end to show hey look who we got in this movie!” I was waiting for the Mike Meyers reveal too! Particularly because of the dedicate face avoidance thing. 

Which, I will say, in the end I enjoyed as a red herring because I truly forgot about the character that ended up being the main villain after the bombing. He was clearly up to no good and I was sure he was going to resurface later in the film after his “death” but they did a decent job of making me forget about him. For some reason I kept expecting Mark Strong to be cameo as the secret bad guy (mostly because of the bald head lol). When they actually revealed the character, it was so not what they were playing it up to be. I agree completely just saw it. Never saw this he before it but am a major history buff. Hell they never even mention or show France despite mentioning the Western Front. I really was underwhelmed to say the least. Yeah first thought when I saw the villains face was ""are we supposed to know who that is?"" Kingsman 2 and this make a great case for why the first was cinematic perfection. Everything about it was just right, perfectly balanced. Haha, I’m glad Vaughn is just going for it without fear. Also looks like Aaron Taylor will be the “new recruit” for the next film. That already makes it whole lot more interesting. Honestly, it's for the better. They probably would have been a joke like all the other nations that weren't England in this movie. If you recall from the first movie, it was said Kingsman was found by people who lost their heirs to WW1. > had nothing better to do tonight and I have A-List

Exactly why I saw it I mean, if you remember what Harry said about the group’s origin, you could have clicked Conrad’s death a mile away. > The plan also made no sense to me. Why is everyone on board with mr Scottish independence? 

This definitely struck me as very weird by the end. I was expecting a lot more twisty secret plotting, and some kind of deeper motivation to kick-starting and continuing WWI that somehow profited all involved.

Instead motherfucking Rasputin is all-in on this plan to get Russia into a war, then right back out of that same war all to... destroy England? Like what is Rasputin or Lenin getting out of all this? Why are they listening to this whiny Scot at all? The hell was the bomber guy so afraid of that he was about to take his suicide pill instead of just... going anywhere else? 

You work for a guy that has a video of Wilson getting a blowjob and a bunch of goats. It's not exactly ""bomb in the base of your skull"" territory. I believe they mentioned in the scene where they were talking about cashmere in the Kingsman store that it only game from goats in a particular spot in Iceland, so I'm pretty sure that's where the barn lair was. I was fully expecting Bruhl to anticipate them cracking the telegram and that it was supposed to be a trap of sorts. Nope, just immediately backfired. The villains’ plans were a bit all over the map It felt like they just chose this time period because they could mix and match random historical events rather than actually having to write up a story. I’m surprised no one’s talked about that No Man’s Land night fight. Absolute highlight scene for sure.  I really like that fight scene and the final sword fight >All in all the movies okay but should of been about kingsman more. 7/10

I think that applies to every Kingsman movie. The last 2 were ""The Agency gets fucked, Eggsy does it by himself"" Yeah it kinda felt like they choreographed some WW1 themed fight scenes and tried to construct a story around them. Baron Zemo. Put some respect on that name. As long you walked out after the Rasputin fight scene. 

> The guy stuck on the lift was such a small character, but soooo funny.


“WHO THE FUCK IS THAT GUY?!”

The way the actor delivered his lines were so aggressively American. I loved it. I understand peoples gripes with the film not having the characteristics of the other two films, but I honestly like it. War can be a touchy subject so I can see why some of the humor was toned down. As a history buff I enjoyed it, historical inaccuracies and all. As someone who's into history i actually really loved the historical nods. Gavrilo Princip really botched the assassination at first then lucked out as he was eating sandwiches at a diner. Rasputin was rumored to have survived poison, stabbing and gunshot wounds (I was half expecting him to come back later in the film). Kitchener really did die en route to Russia after his ship hit a mine. My only gripe was the ultimate villain reveal turned out to be a nobody. Well I liked his arc cause it was a kid believing that he was fighting for a noble cause defending his country. But in the end after seeing his squadmates die in battle, he realizes the pointlessness of the war. (The moment with him and the injured guy in the crater was really nice) And in the end even tho he had good intentions, him lying about his identity cost him his life. I do like that entire section of the movie but it did drag a bit GETTING there. I looked over at my wife her jaw had dropped I tried to find a serious answer and I couldn't.

Then I tried to find a joke answer and I still coudn't. I think it was Harry Morton I listened to the Last Podcast on the Left’s multi-part podcast on Rasputin and they really didn’t exaggerate the way he acted too much. Dude did not care much for social conventions. Agreed. Bummed the got rid of the character so quickly tho The entire Russia arc was way more interesting than anything else. An entire movie about Rasputin in this tone would be incredible The lack of the Rasputin song during the fight scene made me cross. I really loved that they've included all assassination methods described in the most famous account of Rasputin's murder: pie with cyanide, shot several times, drowned in ice-cold water. 

Especially interesting is the final headshot from Polly's revolver: according to a version put forth by some researchers, the shot fired in Rasputin's face had been made from a British revolver.

Moreover, while the real Felix Yusupov did not have the Duke of Oxford (or his son) for a cousin, he was good friends with an Englishman he met while studying at Oxford. At the time of Rasputin's murder that Englishman was an agent of MI6 in Russia, and it is speculated that he took part in the assassination (however, there seem to be no relevant documents in the MI6 archives). So the idea of Britain taking part in the murder of Rasputin is not as far-fetched as it may seem! :) I couldn't help but compare it to 1917 and cane to the realization.....nothing is ever gonna top that movie for me. It managed to knock Saving Private Ryan from it's throne as my favorite war movie.. I agree but it was different in a good way. Was looking for this exact comment. Felt like an anti-war statement dropped into the middle of the film. Powerful stuff but I don't think it fit in with the rest of the film. It wasn't ""Elton John beating a robot dog to death with a bowling ball in an Americana-themed diner in a secret drug empire enclave on the top of a mountain"" goofy, though it was ""strange angry Scottish man gets stabbed through the chest by a goat and then flung off a secret conspiracy enclave on the top of a mountain"" goofy, so it felt in line with the other movies. Felt like it toned things down appropriately, considering, you know, World War I. I felt Matthew Vaughn intentionally toned it down since the last Kingsmen film wasn't received well. It has  all of the  style  of a  King's man movie but almost none  of the fun  in the  tone  of the  movie, they played it  way too serious. Nah I mean it was still slightly there but it felt more dramatic than the other two. Kinda felt like a different series to me In fact they said the exact opposite.

Also, Hitler and Stalin had a non-aggression pact. If there’s a direct sequel, expect Hitler to go “off script.” Gotta whitewash the crimes of the British empire somehow If you listened carefully enough you'd have heard ""Hail Hydra!"". The character who introduced them explicitly stated “time we found a counter on the right,” implying their ideologies were different. Hm? Hitler isn't being introduced as Lenin's protege. Mid credits scene. It was bad. I really feel like that was the original plan, but it was to political as that conflict still hasn't fully been resolved to this day. Literally 😂😂 like would Scotland not be destroyed as part of the United Kingdom? Lmao Watching this as a Scot was fucking grim.

* The posh English kid forces a Scottish soldier out of his regiment so he could impersonate him.
* The posh English kid is then the only member of the (notoriously hardcore [Black Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Watch)) regiment to volunteer for a dangerous job.
* A Scottish Black Watch member then kills the heroic posh English kid friendly fire, in a stereotypically short-tempered fit of anger.
* Literally **all of WW1** is blamed on a Scottish nationalist.
* The evil Scottish bad guy isn't even played by a fucking Scot, his shite hammy accent comes from an [English actor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Goode)

Meanwhile, as Scots are shit on to an almost comical degree, the English are treated with propaganda-level kid gloves. Sure, Ralph Fiennes murdered a bunch of Africans in a British colony, but *he looked sad about it in the mirror*, so it's ok!

I think it's worth mentioning that 135,000 Scots died fighting for Britain in WW1—[a disproportionately high number compared to the rest of the UK.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-46124327) 

The whole thing just seemed outrageously insensitive and tone deaf. Don't even get me started on quoting ""Dulce et Decorum Est"" with a straight face in a film series that trivialises and glamorises violence. Totally clueless. I guessed that it was him towards the end of the movie bc that was the only character who made sense to me, but I forgot that >!he was supposed to be dead!< How absurdly unpractical would be to convene on top of that mountain, anyway?

See, an element like that could work if the film was consistently goofy (though the whole thing with the Shepherd is honestly Austin Powers-level of goofiness), but then it was interspersed with extremely serious war drama sequences. The tonal whiplash was real. Yeah honestly if I'd been part of the creative team I'd have made sure we sat down to flesh out something super creative and fun to answer this exact question. For all of the flock...not just Rasputin. Didn't the network exist well before that?

I guess I kinda worded it wrong. It's just weird that this movie is supposed to be a Kingsman origin but some sort of an spy agency already exists in the movie. I expected to see how they started Kingsman completely from scratch. I was expecting him to keep coming back. Idk but those were some badass suits Surprisingly, bulletproof armor like that was really developed during WW1! They are modeled after WWI German Army Sturmtruppen or Stoßtruppen. Translates to Storm Troopers, Shock Troopers or Shove Troopers. They were elite soldiers trained to infiltrate enemy trenches and eliminate resistance to collect intel and make openings for German army assaults. They specialized in close quarter trench fighting. Daggers, axes, the first generation of submachine guns were designed for them specifically for clearing narrow trenches and focused on eliminating enemy snipers, artillery spotters, machine gun positions and commanders. All sides had their own versions of these types of troops by the last years of the war. The scene would have been great, in a different film. Just 15 minutes earlier I was watching Rasputin dance fighting pantless assassins. A sad, serious look at WW1 is not what I expected or wanted in my third installment of a goofy spy flick. It's not what the trailer promised me either. &#x200B;

Sameeeeee And the Scotish soldier who happens to be of similar height and build to his now dead son who delivered a letter... It's independent of the bureaucracies of government. The King of England is not exactly the leader of govt post WW2, it's not really much different than the Duke of Oxford being involved who likely held a seat in the House of Lords. And the King isn’t sitting at the head of the table? The most unrealistic thing of all the movies! It was very D&D at the end ngl Not even at a round table smh I thought he was the mole but when he was revealed as the big bad I was like “oh ok” He was the only person it could be, but honestly it was so poorly written they never gave the guy any real build up to feel a betrayal >  the sheltered son of an English duke

But that sheltered son had a lifetime of training that only money and a lifetime of leisure can afford. I thought the use of bits of the 1812 overture in that scene was great too agreed 100%...I used to seriously dance and teach ballet and the very distinct balletic style of his fighting made me so happy I just saw the movie tonight, based on the trailer I thought he was the big bad. I was kind of disappointed when I found out he wasn't > I HATED the twist with the Scottish main villain in the end, it seemed very cheap.

Yeah it made no sense From the trailers and stuff I thought Rasputin was going to be the main villain, weird. It's not only that, the entire first half had it look like that he would be the main villain only for them to kill him off after one action scene. The scene of Rasputin performing the ""healing"" (which reminded me of cunnilingus) of the leg had me squirming, laughing, and left my mouth hanging open.  It was a brilliant scene. i was waiting for Rasputin to return somehow. i mean, i wasn't expecting it, but i held out hope for the final battle. I assumed he was the main villain due to trailers and his dialog about tortoises 

Expectations subverted. >was by far the most menacing villain!

They were all written and performed terribly aside from Rasputin (and I wouldn't be surprised if there was some improv by Ifans there). Daniel Brühl looked bored. And Mata Hari required much more charisma and screen presence. That scene wasn't even that good I have no idea why everyone went on and on about it.  Choppy action and broken up by melodramatic interruptions Well yes obviously it was published in 1920 but it was written earlier. Within the scope of the film the poem was written by Lord Oxford’s son and sent in his last letter. 

Editing to add the poem was written by Wilfred Owen and he wrote most of his work in the trenches, over the course of a single year. Yup.

That's why Daniel Brühl was strangely not used very much in the movie.

Any character with a monocle should be a big deal. Yeah. Lenin meets Hitler. Honestly I laughed harder at this than anything else in the movie. I laughed so much at the sheer fucking bonkerness of that scene, and this would just tip it to that perfect spot.
The fuck. Yeah I was confused too! Saw him behind the camera and recognized the guy and then suddenly in the credits scene I thought huh, oh so the guy killing the romanov family was Hitler? Damn! She did. She watched this one first lol. Start leaving later.  If I can get to my seat as the lady tells me how great amc is I fell blissful ""They say Fortune Favors the Bold^(TM), Dingham. Do *you* Favor the Bold^(TM)?""

""Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe go fuck yourself."" Welcome to the club! It was immediately obvious to anyone from Scotland that whoever was playing the big bad was definitely not Scottish, so that would have excluded David Tennant for most.

I actually found it unintentionally funny that Conrad’s killer points out his poor attempt at a Scottish accent, when it was just as good as Matthew Goode’s and Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s. Entry requirements did not seem that high, it's like you, what was your name again, yes Archie, you will join our secret organisation. Yeah, Stanley Tucci’s character was definitely at the table. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Stanley Tucci His name is Orlando Oxford lmao Yeah I thought this too but if you remember the first movie, the beginning of The Kingsmen was partly because all these rich people lost their heirs so they put their large wealths towards good. People remember this would have seen his death coming before even watching the movie. It actually does advance the plot.  He's the reason Collin character exist.  The son room his place.   In the first kings men. Clearly you didn't see the opening of The Golden Circle and the ridiculous waste of Roxy's character. I think it just gets lost in the movie's pacing and general tone. It's pretty all over the place honestly, which is unfortunate because I think the anti-war messaging is quite genuine, but it is obscured by the fact that the movie still wants to be an action-comedy with some serious moments. In a weird sort of way, it also kind of counteracts itself. Every major ""character"" that dies during the WWI sequence dies because they are individually good and heroic. The spy is wounded/killed in the line of duty being incredibly brave, the recon officer is killed when he tries to save a boy's life, and Conrad himself dies being a self-sacrificing hero. This all stacks up to ""a man's character is nothing in the face of ubiquitous and relentless violence"", but then the remaining cast go save the day with... individual character and heroism. >how anti-war the whole movie is

Anti-war, pro-violence. Like, yup. Pacifism is for the indecisive. Anastasia:Russian Girlboss Um can we get a screenwriter to work on this? Sounds really entertaining Idk about spy agencies--I would almost want the US to be first as a response to the Civil War like how Kingsman was a response to WWI

But remember that Kingsman was a centuries old tailor's before they bought it to make it the Kingsman Agency so the presence of Statesman liquor doesn't say anything about the spy agency. I imagine Kingsman was formed first. The US Ambassador who was involved with Kingsman at the end of the movie spinning Statesman off would make some amount of sense, I think. If we ever get an adaptation of The Last American Vampire (the sequel to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) I hope that Disney/20 Century Studios gets Ifans to play vampire Rasputin because they definitely would have to adapt the scene of the book where Henry teams up with Nikola Tesla and Mark Twain to  kill Rasputin His portrayal was by-and-large the best thing about the movie. Totally unrecognizable and truly committed 100%. 

I wanted to see much more of him Lacks a soul let alone Kingsman's soul... I gotta be honest, the last thing I expect from Kingsmen is ""historical accuracy"". LOL. It was fascinating how much it used actual historical events. Especially the absurdity of the assassination.

Everything about WWI history feels like a farce, except that millions of people died.

Oh, and I loved that Rasputin was poisoned, stabbed, drowned, and shot. I’m an amateur history lover, so I’m personally a sucker for historical fiction. This! It's an over the top silly action movie loosely connected with WWI. The Kaiser in this reminded me of Charlie Chaplin Hitler. Just don't take it too seriously and enjoy the Sopwith camel, no man's land fight scenes, and other quirky nods to history. You'll enjoy it.

If that's not for you and you're more interested in a Kings man origin story, you'll probably be disappointed. Holy smokes I’m right with you on the 30 minutes part. I was just hoping the movie would end soon I thought the manner of his death was fitting because it really is that quick sometimes. And leaving behind so much is a reality. The “sunken cost” factor made it more upsetting for me. I think that was the point, though. To show how pointless war can be. >But then the Rasputin mission happened, and he knew clear as day, that he could help his “country” by doing said kind of missions with his father.

>“Nooooooo! I have to go to the trenches to die in the mud and have a meaningless death.”


Well, to be fair I think the movie kind of had to go down that route, because otherwise it would leave the unfortunate implication that all the rich and connected who avoided service were actually doing far more important secret spy missions that did more to affect the war than a frontline soldier could. It would be seen as glorifying aristocratic draft dodgers. Exactly. It wouldn't make any sense for him to give his real identity after swapping places with the other soldier. He didn't expect to get called out as an impersonator (no one had called him out yet, despite his lack of an accent). When called out he immediately started to explain himself, but was shot before he could get anything out. this is a month old comment, so I apologize, but I think you really hit the nail on the head here. 

The movie is obsessed with the british empire aesthetic. It seems to love the Bond Street tailoring, clipped words and mustaches, firm handshakes, pretty women and loyal servants. But it doesn't do more than a cursory nod towards acknowledging the horrors the british empire was responsible for at that time. 

its never more obvious than during the front line scenes where the Germans are dressed very much like Nazis, despite being set 20 years before Nazism was even a twinkle in Mr Hitler's eye. 

Its because the Nazi helmet and black cloak are an immediate trigger for modern audiences to recognise ""bad guy"". 

Which is a bit of an issue because it sets the british, and therefore the british empire in the light of ""good guy"". Which, as we know, is rather a difficult position to defend. 

I'm not 100% certain of my history here, but my understanding is that England never ""conquered"" Scotland, and that it had been sovereign until about 1700, roughly around when the United Kingdom was formed, and had been chill pretty much since then. Even before that, various british kings had been Scottish. I think we've traditionally had a rather good relationship since about 1300? So why they cast the villain as a bitter scotsman? I can't justify in any other way but as a weird ""fuck you"" to Scotland.

Certainly its nothing like the atrocities the british empire subjected Ireland to over the years. The whole thing just felt very strange and nationalistic to me. Nostalgic for a really rather grubby past. I mean the whole 'main villain being a Scot who wants to destroy England as revenge for English oppression' thing is nonsense anyway. It's like it was written by someone who'd never opened a history book. The villain starts by complaining about the English monarch taking over his country (it was a Scottish king that inherited the throne of England, not the other way around) and then whines that his family was forced off their land by the English (it was Scottish landowners responsible for the Highland Clearances, not the English). Just totally anti-English tripe, and that's coming from a Scot. >the bloody king of England is heavily involved.

That made no internal sense at all. I could buy the idea that Oxford being friends with the king would be useful, so the Kingsman could operate freely while the authorities would look the other way. But having directly a seat at the table, and a codename? How would that even work? Does the king get sent on missions? Does he get asked for help? In what form any help from the freaking king of the UK would come, if not through one of the government entities the Kingsman aims to be extricated from? Not only the main villain, but the main hero’s son gets capped in the head by a Scottish soldier for some reason. My friend and I were losing our minds in the theatre at how blatant it was What do you mean? Looking at his filmography I can't really see why you'd claim this is a trait of his. What am I missing? It's getting harder to ignore. That's His Excellency, Mathew de Vere Drummond to you, peasant. So this was the mid/post credits scene. Kinda a yikes, especially considering I mostly enjoyed the movie. Finally a movie about the posh deepstate Well, the other two seemed to manage to pull it off without feeling like an imperial newsreel meant to keep colonial conscripts’ morale high I didn’t realize his name was Conrad until the end of the movie. I kept wondering why everyone was calling him Comrade, even his father TIL It wasn't the dude from 1917 Got his knob slobbed, too. On camera! okay thank god I wasn’t the only one I was weirded out that France wasn’t mentioned at all, the movie acted like it didn’t exist Not even mentioning France or the French is par for the course for modern British and American WW1 movies

At least the Russians are mentioned this time, they too are often completely erased from Hollywood WW1 movies at first i though it was the soldier that swapped places with conrad, and after the reveal i wished i was right I'm just waiting for his character to emigrate to America where he'll turn out to be Kick-Ass's grandpa. All they had to do was have the main ""Mr Independence"" (I saw it a few hours ago and already forgot his name) tell promise the followers that the plan was to have Germany conquer Europe for them the divide it up amoung them all and it would have ade sense as to why they were all on-board.

In fact an even better script would've been an African leader whose motive was to carve up what was left of Europe after inciting WWI as revenge for what the colonisers did to Africa. This would've worked considering how the movie started and their fucking lair seemed super expensive to build and sustain and operate out of, on top of being absolutely inconvenient. where did that guy get the money for that.  


loved the absurdity and some of the way they used it. but it was just too dumb after the reveal. >goats in a particular spot in Iceland

They didn't mention Iceland at all. Cashmere goats live in Kashmir. That place was clearly on the Himalayas, the henchmen were also dressed accordingly, and certainly didn't look like Icelanders. To be fair, the telegram immediately backfired in real life too. And the main reason i like the no mans land fight was that it felt very very “Kingsman” like conrad goes from a regular knife fight to fighting a german ww1 juggernaut lol Well to be fair, kingsmen the secret service and kingsmen the golden circle were about kingsmen and or the statesmen doing spy stuff. The Kings Man has like a bit of that with the rasputin stuff but a majority of this new movie was just a World War 1 movie And then slapped the Kingsman name on it. OH FUCK!!! That is wild that they put the Archduke _back_ in an open car the same day of a failed assasination I also enjoyed the nods. We know this is fiction, but it’s nice when things wind up making nice with the broad strokes of history. (Looking at you, Inglorious Basterds) Hail yourself! If anything they actually toned him down. More like Raspoopin. In general, the downfall of the tsars and russian revolution is one of the most interesting periods in history especially how it lead all the events of the whole century and the modern era. I was surprised Rasputin was dealt with so early. I expected him to be the main villain. Like he'd be this film's Largo, working for the larger organisation of Goat-Spectre. i was actually surprised they didn't do it especially since it was in one of the trailers 1917 is amazing Excuse me! Stabbed through the *thigh* by a goat The goofiness in this film is forced and doesn't fit the narrative of the previous films...which already had changed the narrative slightly from the comic...and I love Matthew Vaughn films ...but this one was week probably because there was no comic to go off of for inspiration...this was a project he concocted himself. wow, non aggression pact, that means they are on the same team, unlike the rest of Europe who all had their non aggression pacts... Kinda ironic how 50 years later it was the boers that went on to establish apartheid Oh didn’t stick around The Ra is the villain in loads of shit, no one cares, personally I'd have preferred a better movie. As if the Scotland thing will ever be resolved. There are Cornish separatists Yeah as if a German invasion would just stop at Berwick-upon-Tweed? >The whole thing just seemed outrageously insensitive

When the son was killed after a prolonged war drama sequence and then we switch to a grieving, self-destructive Ralph Fiennes who's reminded of the broken promise made to her dying wife, I literally shouted out loud ""What the fuck is this film doing?!"". Literally 20 minutes before that extremely serious-minded second act, they had a goofy dance-fight with a horny Rasputin! Did Vaughn ever hear about tone-deafness? Somebody should explain that to him, it might help him take more informed creative decisions. Agreed. It would've seemed like a joke in itself if it wasn't played so straight.What about portraying the Germans as a bunch of moustache twirling villains?
Generally I don't mind this stuff too much but this movie was a bit too much, even if I enjoyed. I'm watching it now and I'm utterly baffled by the tone. The previous Kingsman movies felt like goofy, cartoony throwbacks to early Bond movies. And since the main character wasn't posh and everything was so over the top, it felt self-aware enough that you could embrace the fantasy ideal of heroic English gentlemen-ness without having to consider the ugly realities that accompanied English imperialism.

But this... it's played totally straight 90% of the time, and it uses absolutely horrific real-world historical events to tell a completely ahistorical story of English heroism. What a gigantic miscalculation. I think the villain could only have worked if they had revealed he was in fact English pretending to be Scottish at the end. Everything being an act because he's a mirror image of Oxford perhaps but one who was broken by the loss of his own son/wife/whatever and wants to burn the world would at least give him some motivation. Pretending to be Scottish could be just a front for his SPECTRE council. Probably similar if you watched the first Kingsman film as a Black man or an environmentalists – the villain is black and Obama gets his head exploded, and also the bad guy is doing it all because he cares about the environment. Vaughn obviously cares little for bad optics. Just finished watching this and was so baffled that they actually wrote this Honestly having seen Tucci turn up randomly as an ambassador and Aaron Taylor Johnson as the Scottish soldier, I suspected that the secrecy about the bad guy was not because of who the character was more so than which famous dude was going to be playing him Right!  If you are pulling the strings of the world then 1) it would be much easier to do from a populated area but also b) if the dude just wants to live up there with his goats why does he care what’s happening in the world? Villains table with his henchmen was straight out of Austin Powers. >Didn't the network exist well before that?

Nope. They said they started it afterwards because they didn't believe Princep to be working alone. 

>be a Kingsman origin but some sort of an spy agency already exists in the movie. I expected to see how they started Kingsman completely from scratch.

That's what we saw, just from the eyes of the son and not the Duke Yeah a few jokes in the film would've been nice 😅 >And the Scotish soldier who happens to be of similar height and build to his now dead son who delivered a letter.

I still have to understand why that character was in the movie at all. The son could have just switched with any random soldier and sent a letter through Royal Mail. They should have killed that guy the second they realized the swap. Traitor Speaking of the table it’s a little funny they have the line with his mom where she says “it’s a round table so all men were equal” then the Kingsman have a regular table anyway with Arthur at the head My exact thoughts Same haha I thought the real big bad was going to be James McAvoy lol

It wasn't his voice but the buzzcut looked like him in profile. They basically weaponised the way that song just doesn't end, so the music constantly felt like the fight was just about to resolve. I googled around for anyone else interested - It's called Combat Hopak and it's the martial arts of the Cossacks! ""okay, for the big villain we can either have incredibly charismatic, utterly insane, unkillable **literal wizard**, or... a Scottish guy with a load of goats and a weird grudge.""
""its obvious, isn't it?"" How did no on notice he was missing for a month when he would travel to meet his evil henchmen Being from Scotland this hurt to watch Right! When he stepped out the shadows, I was, like, ""huh? Who's that?"" To have someone who, essentially, was a minor role of maybe two or three scenes become the big bad, was a move out of left field I thought the guy sitting next to Oxford's son in church, asking what the phrase meant, was Wilfred Owen, the author of the poem. He died a week before Armistice so obviously it was written before 1920. Even in universe it didn't make sense since the poem is so anti-war but Conrad wrote it when he was a blood thirsty warmonger What the fuck happened in this scene?? Daniel Brühl starring in the Young Monopoly Man origin story. let's do it. It was so over the top and ridiculous I’ll give this movie credit for doing such corny ass stuff > Lenin meets Hitler

This is now Ben Shapiro favorite movie. Shit, should have stuck around. But I really needed to pee! As goofy as a smiling Lenin standing next to Tsar Nicholas abdicating I want to see the trailers though.  I have OCD and am always curious what trailers played.  One time I saw two movies back to back and there was a few minutes overlap and I always wondered if the first preview I saw (""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"") was the first for that film or if I had missed one prior to it.  I think the ""Encanto"" trailer played first because it was ""Jungle Cruise"" in IMAX.

Man, everyone really hates that Nicole Kidman ad. I'm glad they shortened it though, it used to be longer He doesn't even say ""bold"". He says ""Fortune favors the brave"" if I remember right. Very clever. Scottish person here. I thought it was david tennant, but he was playing his voice to make it non obvious. But no it was not David Tennant. Lmao I didn't recognise most of them at the time - only the main three. I looked up the others later and thought it was ridiculous. A completely random soldier who they met once, an American ambassador who appeared for about 15 seconds and the King of the British Empire are the country's new secret intelligence operatives. 

I guess they were the only popular actors in it who hadn't died yet so it makes sense in that regard. I think they make him a Kingsman because Conrad named him ""Lancelot"" when sent him to Oxford's household to deliver the news that he and Archie are swapped. 

So, letting him in is all because of the ""Lancelot"" thing, which is quite stupid. And also probably why the title ""Lancelot"" is so cursed in the Kingsman's ranks - whoever has is bounds to suffer a horrible fate in the end. Also you better believe he started funding anti-brain-bullet technology right after this Yeah, I watched the first two movies in the days leading up to this one and you could see the son's death coming from a mile away. In that way, the section was tense because you knew he would die but he kept narrowly avoiding it. Surviving the bomb at the end only to die so unceremoniously hurt. I thought it was good storytelling, though I don't know how it'd work for viewers who thought that it was just a random war aside. Huh? I also thought Wilson’s line of ‘we’re going to war!’ being played as a victory also undermined the anti-war message, especially as it is one of the last lines in the film. I agree, hell the motivation of all the characters was to keep Russia in and make USA join the war. Also, France doesn't exist. > Conrad himself dies being a self-sacrificing hero.

Nooo. He died because he was an idiot. There was nothing heroic about it I was disappointed they went with Oxford killing the villain when IMO he should have spared him to face justice... and then the goat butts him off the cliff after he makes some speech about humans being easily fooled into not following their instincts. Well, I already wrote an alternate version of Anastasia that was starting to become a Stephen King novel. I guess I could try. Reconstruction-era Statesman would be a fun film.

There was a big attempt at terrorism and counterterrorism during that chaotic time in the South. Part of what’s so good about the first one is you have a punk kid becoming refined


But this is just played straight The first part had a terrible pacing issue. From opening to the first mission refused to let the film breath at all. 

Then later the weird suoer-serious tonal change to a WW1 film, and they back again to a more lighthearted action flick. 

Didn't know what it wanted to be. 

And I absolutely hated the music. It overburdened so many scenes, telegraphing what was happening or some weird triumphic tune to say ""you remember this? You remember this room? You remember this logo?

And it didn't give scenes to breathe since it ran through whole moments and then next scene- evil villian score. 

It felt like music you'd have in a trailer to establish a shot, but it kept going. I was proud of myself for remembering the story of the guy who shot Ferdinand. That his first attempt failed, he went to get lunch, then by coincidence the Archduke rode by him. Not even sure if that was true or an urban legend.

And the definite urban legend of Rasputin's death. Well it's more ""loosely based on actual history"", but there's so few films set in WWI that I get unreasonably happy about it lol (did not like Wonder Woman tho). Right? I was surprised at how well the film hewed to actual history given that, you know, it's a *Kingsman* film. It would have been better and more poignant if he had just died in a senseless charge to show how insane WW1 was. Instead we got the dumb mixup and getting killed by an ally lol Especially with the Germans donning gas masks, just trying to make them as inhuman/monstrous as possible, so weird. Kinda reminded me of the first Wonder Woman movie being set in WW1 but treating the Germans like Nazis.

Like if you want a movie with easy bad guys, yeah Nazis are the obvious easy choice. But choosing to set in WW1 (presumably so the hero’s don’t have to deal with the Holocaust and can spend all their time fighting faceless soldiers and such) but keeping the Germans=Nazis aesthetic (not to mention morality) is such a cop-out. 

It is pretty funny tho, to think that according to this movie WW1 was started by an angry Scottish goat farmer, made easy by an incompetent German and a naive Russian, ultimately resolved thanks to the efforts of the one “good” King, the English one. Like man, surprised Vaughn didn’t have a cameo straight wanking off George. >I think we've traditionally had a rather good relationship since about 1300?

It's not quite that simple - have a skim of this article for the period you're referencing.  William Wallace, Robert the Bruce etc are best known for their poor relationship with the English crown.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence) It would have made more sense if the villians were Irish people who held a grudge against the English and the empire but that would have made for a more dodgy and insufferable Tory movie. “For some reason.”

Well they thought he was a spy? Kinda the point. Time of paranoia and some random soldier you don’t know, claiming to be someone you know, miraculously shows up. Not really suppose to be super logical as it’s a dude terrified some German sneaked over and is gunna kill them all. It’s weird because the whole point of making the kingsmen an independent intelligence agency was to decouple the spy activities from the imperialist baggage of the bond movies

Yet Matthew Vaughn doubles down on it What else has he made that's imperialist? January Jones' Secret Baby Daddy Esq. Eh assassin's creed did it first No but see they felt bad about the imperialism so it's ok I don't think I've ever heard a characters name repeated on screen so many times I. a 2 hour movie. 

It's like they desperately wanted to make us unmistakably know his name was Conrad as to pull-off the mix-up. I was genuinely mad when the movie acted like, without Russia, England was doomed, unable to fight alone, even though England was not fighting alone at all. I thought that was gonna be the case too, since I'm pretty sure the soldier who shot Conrad said that character was Scottish! Also otherwise weird to have ATJ in the movie just to hang around for a couple minutes like that. Maybe him being the villain was the plan and it got shifted by reshoots? You could have even had it be someone who was being kept in Kitchener's concentration camp at the v start. >  where did that guy get the money for that.
> 
> 

Dudes got shitloads of some of the finest cashmere in the world bro. > where did that guy get the money for that. 

The rare, expensive cashmere? As I recall Franz Ferdinand himself basically insisted on it after being driven to the hospital to meet with the people who'd been injured in the failed assassination attempt. Wanted to show his resoluteness in the face of hostility and complete the procession. Megustalations! Do you know of any good videos on it? This movie made me very curious. That was the whole film tbh - get rid of all the interesting characters early and keep the less interesting ones around. Yeah, especially how prominent he was in the trailers I got the same impression from the trailer as well and even told my boyfriend that he is the main villain of the story. The whole fight was pleasure to watch, he was menacing, but how it ended is quite disappointing. They were Allies at the start of WW2, though It was a pact of convenience. Nazi Germany would get more land to the East and the Soviet Union got their battlefront moved further to the west. They definitely teamed up against Poland, yes. Yeah, spot-on. Losing the 'working class James Bond' subversion was another big part of why this came across as punching down. Yes! I just said the same thing in another comment. I was expecting Jim Carrey or something since it was so secretive and the character was so over the top. I'm guessing those two are going to be in the sequel, then. I had the same thought. I thought it was gonna be David tenant or David Beckham, those were my guesses. Then they reveal the twist and I was like “oh yeah, forgot bout him” Probably so they can use him on the sequel where he'll have a son who is going to be Mark Strong's character. And the black man their slave.  Even though he was with them from the beginning.  Let's not mentioned he was their when the kid was a boy not the woman setting next to Arthur. I enjoyed the movie but as a black man they. Used a good black actor and took away his lines to boost the woman.  You think any words of wisdom would come from the guy who's known you your sons whole life and trained him in knife fighting.  That's just me. I kept trying to guess the actor who was the big bad. Had to be someone who could do a flawless Scottish accent in that register, and have some shocking star power for a grand reveal.

Matthew Goode is decent and all but wasn't a great reveal. I was hoping for Ewan McGregor. Right. Like they all traveled across the globe when it would have taken weeks to get there. Like this is before plane travel so they're all going on ships or trains. Did they ever say where that location is? I assumed it was at least in the UK

Lame excuse, but it's at least kinda plausible he could have a few days off here and there Though it was a nice touch that they made a point of showing Scottish soldiers fighting in the war. That alluded to things not being quite as simple as the villain says they are. I thought it was absolutely hilarious that in the Kingsman universe World War 1, and by extension World War 2, were both started because a Scottish nationalist wanted to bring down England.

I did slightly wince when King George told Oxford the monarchy owes its existence to his efforts, retroactively making me regret rooting for their success. I expected him to be the spy when the main villain said he had a spy in the British government. Then it turned out to be himself. That would be a nice touch. Would be as bit strange as Owen studied to be clergy and would have know it’s meaning but that was obviously for the audience. Daniel Bruhl introduces a young Hitler to Lenin I'm a week late, but the Monopoly Man has never had a monocle! I SWEAR I remember seeing him have a monocle, but he has never had one. Perhaps one of the greatest Mandela effects.
 https://www.monopolyland.com/monopoly-man-monocle/
https://www.quora.com/Am-I-the-only-one-to-remember-the-Monopoly-man-with-a-monocle this movie was basically all of the stuff that you thought to yourself in history class to amuse yourself, but didn't vocalize out of fear of being mocked. No fucking shit it’s over the top and corny, have you even see a Kingsmen film? Fuck that racist bitch. After going to the movies for so long… Black Widow… Eternals…. Kings Man…. Matrix…. Free Guy… Dune… Shang Chi…. Now the only one left standing is Maverick…. Tired of seeing that damn trailer. Those damn Coca Cola ice and popcorn commercials have also gotten to me lol He should have been involved in the final battle with the goats but he was a complete no show. He should have been used in a way to show him taking the mantle of Lancelot after the son's death. Him being shoehorned at the end just felt taky But also failed in that research race because in The Golden Circle we see that it's Statesmen that have anti-brain-bullet technology that is novel to the Kingsmen The son’s death is the motivation for the existence of the Kingsman (as mentioned in the first movie) My interpretation was it was a continued pisstake at the expense of the character. Don’t think it was heroic at all. Wilson has like three lines “get me a statesman on the rocks” twice, then doing the stereotypical gun toting murican “we’re going to war” along with him getting caught in a sex scandal. Joke character and that was a continuation of the joke Also had a good villain who was in it a lot which we didn't get here. Sam and his knife-footed assassin were incredible. The villain in this was boring and hardly in it. Maybe they felt like with the older setting they had to tone it down but I'm not buying that. You can tone it down and still be interesting. There was no reason for it to be as long as it was. I don't understand the need for modern movies to be over 2 hours long. Oh, the truth is far more ridiculous. The whole group, the Black Hand, were scattered across Ferdinand's parade route so they'd have multiple chances to kill him. The first guy got cold feet, the second straight up no-showed, the third tried to snipe him with a pistol and, upon failing, fled and tried to commit suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill and jumping into a river, only for the cyanide to be expired and the river to be two feet deep at the part he jumped in. Another guy threw a grenade that was a dud, and Gavrilo Princip threw a grenade that only got the car behind Ferdinand. After they all failed, Princip ran off and got a coffee, only for Ferdinand's car to come rolling by after the parade was over and take a wrong turn, at which point Princip followed and finished the job for real with his pistol. Like he survived a night assault and a fireman carry (running in a straight line no less) and a bomb…idk I think it was fitting to die a spy since he was a former spy than to have just been shot on the first charge. Yeah, the empire worship is like tory/royalist propaganda, its wild as fuck. 

Its a really weird trope. I guess because in the minds of a lot of people, ww2 is a continuation of ww1? I see why they might think that; the hyper nationalism leading up to ww2 was in part, a direct response to the perceived harshness of the Treaty of Versailles. 

But to extrapolate that connection to ""the nazis were around in 1918, and caused ww1"" is just a really strange way to warp history. Both conflicts were intensely complex, geopolitically, but the circumstances, morals, and key elements were very different. I was so confused they chose a Scottish villain instead of an Irish one, considering that this time period is when the Irish independence cause became widespread The other movies also spell out that the Kingsman were originally founded by people who lose their children to war. Right after Conrad got capped I remembered that this was basically foretold in the first of the trilogy. Then knock him out? Don't *shoot him through the brain*.

If he *was* a spy, now they can't interrogate him Such a shame too, I fucking loved the first movie and thought that he actually nailed the tone there. The problem is IMO the first Kingsman was such a high note for me that Vaughn could only go downhill lmao X-men first class places most of the blame for the Cuban missile crisis on bad faith actors rather than imperial aggression on both sides run amok Also that America joining the war would decisively end it.

The war was borderline over by the time the USA joined the fight. they were scotts! thats why they have kilts. 

my face memory is terrible but i think that he was at the table when kingsman got stablishshed, which i’m guessing is how they justified that character. 

personally that whole subplot felt unnecessary The point is to set ATJ up for a following movie. He’s now a Kingsman. Exactly! They made a point if bringing uo the camp almost as if they were going to say ""oh empire bad"" but then completely ignored it and the film ended up being ""hail Britainnia Check out the Russian Revolution oversimplified video (2 parts).  Funny, entertaining, accurate - you'll have the gist of everything if you watch those.

https://youtu.be/Cqbleas1mmo The Last Czars on Netflix is a pretty good documentary series about it. thats not an alliance, they simply had an agreement stating ""i wont move my troops past this region if you dont cross that line either"" A grandson, surely Agree with your feelings, but just wanted to point out that he wasn't a slave. The UK had banned slavery a century before this movie is set.  He was their servant... which still isn't a great look.  But ya I agree it was very weird they made him Merlin, the quartermaster, at the end as he hadn't done anything resembling the quartermaster's job the whole move. He was much more of a badass fighter (you know, like a knight). He's not a slave at all. Christ what an American take.

>Used a good black actor and took away his lines to boost the woman.

Is it the oppression olympics now?

Shola was playing the same role as Stanley Tucci did in the other 2 movies, how the fuck is that a bad role for him, Merlin is the second most important person in the organisation. Bro he was basically Alfred but way better. He should have had a seat but the first headmaster is still pretty good but yeah no one of color in the founders I was hoping for David Tennant. As someone from Scotland I can say with complete certainty, that accent was absolutely abysmal and very obvious it wasn't a native Scot Damnit now I want Peter Capaldi as a Kingsman villain The movie operates on 21st century superhero movie rules, so near instant travel and global communication. It's in the Kashmir which is in northern  India. I assumed it was in Switzerland. It would make sense as a neutral location during the war, and would fit with the alpine terrain. That is actually a very good point. I'm going to pretend that was intentional and the writer made a poetic point rather than coincidence lol Yeah and then had a Scottish person kill one of the main characters so needlessly. Also as a Scottish person I did not expect a film set around world war 1 to be anti Scottish propaganda. Yeah, it didn't really make a whole lot of sense. A Scottish guy wanted to bring down the whole of Europe to spite England? Ok.

I would've preferred it if it had been someone African trying to destroy Europe as revenge for colonisation. There were a few anti colonial points made that really didn't have much relevance to the film (specifically when the main character said he didn't like killing people defending their homeland) and it would've given reason to the setting of the first few minutes of the film And set Daniel Brühl up as the instigator for WW2 Daniel Bruhl playing Baron Zemo you mean By young Hitler are we talking just before he ascends to power in 1933 or like a baby Hitler? Because whenever I hear that I'm thinking of the latter Daniel Brul as Young Mr. Peanut then. That leaves Young Monopoly Man open for, uh, Cillian Murphy? The other Kingsmen movies weren't about acts that killed tens of million of innocent people. They were camp, and fun, and made fun of the British elite and their customs. This was the opposite, lol. Yeah, Hitler IS pretty racist I've seen the new Jack-Ass trailer about 25 times.  It was supposed to come out in October and it played before every movie (""It fits for all demographics!"") and then it was delayed and now it's playing before every movie again. I dunno, I don't think it really holds up as a joke when that was the entire goal of the protagonists throughout the movie. Rasputin was scene stealing tbh Also their plan just made no real sense You left put that during the wrong turn the driver stalled the car when he was shifting. So they literally just parked right next to princip. It’s fucking bizarre. Damn, you're right. I forgot all about that. Should've seen it coming. Don’t think a grunt soldier with ptsd from being on the front is really thinking things out like that I mean, superhero fiction and ""x historical event was actually supervillains"" isn't new, tbf. I was trying so hard to figure out who that random guy was at the table. Figured we met him somewhere, but I assumed it was of no significance. > The Last Czars

Awesome thanks. Putting this line through a number of independent countries and attacking them together seems like an alliance though. I'm stuck in the 90s.  


edit: also I'm just generally dreadful at maths, and conceiving the passage of time. >He was much more of a badass fighter (you know, like a knight).

The King's Men weren't knights nor fighters. They were spies. Only saw the film last night, but yeah I'd agree that it seemed odd that they picked him for Merlin.
I assume the codebreaking scenes were moved from Shola to Polly just before filming, and I'd assume cut scenes of Shola putting together those hidden cameras/recorders etc to make him being Merlin make more sense?

It either made more sense (to me, at least) to have had Shola at the table, and Polly as Merlin, or give Shola the codebreaking scenes. Wait, Stanley Tucci was in the other movies?

Do you mean Mark Strong? The Tucc was in this movie Same though Really? Interesting to know. I saw that Goode is from Exeter, but I don't know enough about the accent to really hear a huge difference. I imagine that's just like someone from Boston doing a New York accent. I don't think they ever said it was in Kashmir. They said that cashmere was made there. Cashmere is a cloth made from goat hair, which is named after the Kashmir region but can be produced anywhere that goats are raised. No, cashmere is the fabric for the scarf And the book clearly said Switzerland for the location... >  anti Scottish propaganda.

Oh, come on, that's pushing it. He's getting typecast a secret war instigator. It’s WW I-era Hitler: younger physique and full mustache. Also he’s somehow the person responsible for killing the Romanovs. Fun Fact: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky all lived 1913 in Vienna. >The other Kingsmen movies weren't about acts that killed tens of million of innocent people.

Have you actually seen the other movies? The first one was about killing everyone by making them kill each other. The second movie was about poisoning and killing a ton of people. What are you talking about? He was too much of a red herring and should have been more involved. Lot of potential and was a big part of the trailer then poof... Yeah they made some moments like that less ridiculous than the actual attack.

Stuff like the other attacker jumping in the river or the car having to be adjusted to reverse were just swept under the rug. Maybe not. But said grunt soldier also apparently didn't look into the British guy using his missing friend's name the whole time he was missing. So he can't have been *that* worried about him

Like, they swapped places. Conrad wasn't hiding, he was pretending to be the other guy.

The moment was manufactured for shock value There was no coordinated attack, once the Nazis had invaded and the polish government was already broken down and acting in exile, thats when the soviets moved in, yes, they still ended up fighting the remaining military structure that remained and im not going to say something crazy like ""no the soviets didnt invade poland"" but when they invaded, it was triggered by polands government collapsing and them seeing that opportunity to military expand so their border is secured further away from moscow, not because they were working together with the nazis, if they were working together and planning an invasion together you would imagine they would invade at the same time or within a closer timeframe than they really did.

There is historical context that implies to me that their coal was military presence closer to the Nazis with more distance from Moscow than motivation to divide up the lands with the Nazis, mainly the many attempts in getting polands permission to place soviet troops along the poland-german border, which poland would always reject stating that the allies would protect them if the germans did anything. Shola doesn’t have Polly’s training and background in continental European dialects and etiquette so I think Polly doing the code breaking makes sense. Fuck I did. I confuse them a lot Well Boston and New York aren't that far away from each other in American terms. Exeter is a long way from Scotland, and it's in a different country. >Kashmir region but can be produced anywhere that goats are raised.

The entire reason they were able to find the Shepherd was that the Cashmere was rare and only came from a single place Yes... Which historically comes from the *Kashmir* region in India.

Considering the specifically rare goat hair used, it might not be explicitly the Kashmir region but it would certainly be India, Mongolia, China etc and certainly not the UK Well I’d imagine he didn’t know? They’re deployed all over and not really naming themselves. He wouldn’t know his friend was missing. He’d likely just assume he was positioned elsewhere. The micro level of the metaphor isn't required for it to be applicable, but if you want to split hairs, I submit *New York* to *Toronto* instead, for the gentlemen who demands the same distance and separated by a border everyone crosses freely. Yes, but that place doesn't have to be in the Kashmir region. Trust me when I say that to any Scotsman you meet this would NOT be splitting hairs. And accents in Britain vary a lot more than in North America. As an example, Liverpudlian and Mancunian accents are very different to each other, despite the two cities being only 40km (50 miles apart). Apologies if you think I'm being pedantic (I'm really not) but you did say above ""Interesting to know"" so I figured you were receptive to learning the difference! Right but it was a single place where the goats came from, which is likely to be somewhere around that part of the globe at any rate. ",0
46,"Does anyone else think the movie was implying that the dad/Ted was the one who got Autumn pregnant? I felt like they were setting that up but then it didn't go anywhere. Very powerful and haunting at points.

The scene from where the title came from just fucking floored me. Liked the movie a lot, but my biggest (stupid) question was why they brought that big ass suitcase if they didn’t expect to stay more than the day? Everyone is rightfully talking about the scene that gave the film its title, but another scene that really stuck out to me was >!when Autumn tried to induce a miscarriage. God, it was so brutal to watch her choke down those vitamins and punch herself in the stomach over and over!<. Sidney Flanigan was an incredible find here, and I really enjoyed Talia Ryder's performance, too. She has *very* expressive eyes. The title scene is one of the most harrowing performances I’ve seen in a while. Can’t believe Sidney Flanigan’s never acted before.

This entire film is a great example of “show, don’t tell”. Talia Ryder has star potential. Those eyes will make a ton of money. An example of how one great scene can make a movie. As people are saying the title moment was just...incredible. Just watched this. I thought the questionnaire scene was absolutely incredible. Besides that, I thought it was a solid little film. Direction was a little boring.

Also -- maybe I'm way off, but...she was raped by her stepdad, right? In the beginning he couldn't even look at her to tell her she did a good job. And once he does, Autumn storms out. Then the scene later where he's with the dog being creepy and saying ""she likes it, shes a little slut, etc"" and it being a major trigger for Autumn. [deleted] Really strong debut performances from Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder. I honestly think these two girls are going to be movie stars. Talia Ryder is in Spielberg's West Side Story at the end of the year too and I really think she's going to take off. Flanigan gives a really natural performance that doesn't even feel like its acting. She gives the movie this fly on the wall documentary feel that's also aided by the gorilla filmmaking in this that you know they didn't have permits for, especially all those subway scenes.

I think the movie tells an important story, but it all felt very procedural for me a times. Like they take you through the entire abortion process from how I would imagine it exactly goes down. It's emotional, and impactful, but there's an obvious message behind it. The movie is looking to ignite change. A change I believe in, because America, your abortion laws are fucked up, but it also makes the film feel like a Planned Parenthood commercial with high production values. Just saying.

It's a simple story led by some really strong performances tied together with an important message. Great chemistry between the two leads. I just think the plot meanders a little bit and I was taken out of the film by how overtly political it's trying to be, even if I agree with its saying.

Made me feel bad for being a dude. Which is fair, we are shitty. Amazing and impactful film with beautiful lead performances. One question I had: why did the crisis pregnancy centre lie about how far along Autumn was? And also what was the dad saying to the dog? I'm sorry. The movie is good, but it is also really misandrist. All the men are predators and all the women except one are kind characters. And even that one (you know which) thinks that she's acting in a good way.

Reality is not like this. Imagine if the men in the movie were characterised as ""Jews"". We would be talking about a sub-Riefensthal piece.

And it is sad, because the movie is actually good. Sharon Van Etten is in this? Gonna try and queue it up later. Beneath the abortion story, there's a harrowing depiction of how young women are experiencing sex.  Every male character in this movie is kind of a zombified pervert.  Jasper is the only one who shows any brain activity, but even he is just going to great lengths to try to hook up with this girl who will barely talk to him.

It certainly can be true to life, but it's also like an impressionistic depiction of men from the perspective of someone with the history that Autumn describes to her counselor.  Eventually, you think that every man she meets is going to harass her or harm her in someway.  And then you realize you're feeling what she's feeling, and that makes you appreciate even more what she's been through. I really liked this movie. It was sadly relatable at times and it’s a good story. Great acting from everyone involved. That clinic scene was very hard to watch but eye opening. This was a 7/10 for me until the questionnaire scene and from then on it was a really great, engaging film. Every minute was exhilarating and Autumn cousin was an angel I don’t know how to put into terms what this movie made me feel. It was unsettling, but not in any negative way. That’s the best way I can explain it. The way that music & dialogue is used is amazing. I wanted to like this movie, but I was seriously put off by the fact they made every male character with more 1 line a serious creep/pervert/asshole.  I counted 7 -- only 2-3 were necessary to the story.  The acting and story besides the overbearing message ""all men are pigs"" were good.

**Four Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days** (2007) is extremely similar to this movie and far superior. Just finished it and I really loved it. I can't believe that was Sidney Flanigan's first movie ever. Damn. She was absolutely perfect.

I don't understand the low scores on Metacritic though. This movie fucked my shit up. I can't remember the last time a movie left me wanting more like this one did.

 Definitely worth the 20 dollars I spent on the rental. Honestly, I don't think I would have heard of this movie if it didn't go up for rental early on Amazon, and that's a shame. Calling it now, Talia Ryder & Sidney Flanagan are going to be mega stars. I was hoping it would have been better than it was. Outside of one or two scenes, the film is content with just putting a camera on someone and following them with almost no soundtrack, letting the camera speak for the characters. https://youtu.be/Uu3pKy7xebk

I made a video on this movie if you guys want to check it out!! I’m a rising youtube film critic so it’d be appreciated:) but only if you want to!! I thought it was pretty impacting. Especially the title scene. All with a first time actor in Sidney. Here her talk about her experience and being cast in the movie here  [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rec/id1455939192?i=1000471562732](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rec/id1455939192?i=1000471562732) Even in a full year, I couldn't see myself not considering Sidney Flanagan's performance to be one of the best in the year (including last year, I'd really only put her behind Adele Hanael, Noemie Merlant, and Lupita Nyongo in terms of leading performances). That single take of her's is masterful. She let her cousin go alone with that creep? After all the things that cousin did for her? That is your ride or die, stupid. Don't let her go anywhere alone. How does this compare to Beach Rats? I really liked that one, especially the cinematography. Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder were amazing and I wish them both success with their acting careers going forward. 
Never Rarely Sometimes Always is easily the best film of the year and it could stay that way if pretty much nothing releases in the 2nd half of the year. Best looking film of the year too (more filmmakers really need to use 16mm). And for a film with such a simple story, I really didn't expect the film to be as tense as it was either but Hittman does a brilliant job at making you feel Autumn's uncomfortableness and lingering pain. So much information is revealed just from her saying absolutely nothing. I liked it overall, there were some scenes that were very effective and there were other scenes I thought were in such bad faith and so manipulative they made me angry. Really want to watch this but it's not available in my country yet :-( Currently my favorite of the year. Such a beautifully sensitive, hard-hitting film. Sidney Flanigan is nothing short of spectacular. !! Did anyone else google the pregnancy test they used in the clinic at the beginning of the movie?  It was called ""Right Time"".  Look it up, it's a gag pregnancy test kit - they sell them at Walmart (currently sold out, though) and amazon.  Guaranteed to give positive results no matter what.  Why did they choose to use this pregnancy test?  Ok if they wanted positive results from anyone on set's pee, but they could have switched out the boxes for a legit brand.... Was someone on set just having a laugh? I can't find anything about this anywhere, I need answers Yes, that scene with the dog was very unsettling. I think he sexually abused her. 100% was the feeling I got too. The beginning scene where he couldn't even compliment her. The scene with the dog. Her desperation for her mom to not know. Her being SO ANGRY and determined to kill the pregnancy that she starts punching herself. The questionnaire portion. I thought it was pretty much a given that he was raping her, but maybe I'm wrong? The way she looked at him with that dog and what he was saying. Also how she really didn't want her mother to find out. I personally didn’t see any of that. I felt like it was purposefully ambiguous about who the father was, because it didn’t really matter to the plot. Damn, it wasn’t THAT deep My personal reading was it showed how young and inexperienced with the world the girls are. Like the only trips they were probably on were big week long family trips were you pack a massive bag so going anywhere means lots of luggage. Also maybe not understanding how awkward hauling luggage around NYC is, Lmao I literally just finished the movie and was wondering that the whole time. We see her cousin pack some clothes in the beginning but I don't think they ever changed their wardrobe. I mean it doesn't really matter but it was just kind of funny Her punching herself was too much for me to even watch. that scene sold the idea to me that this was the best movie of 2020 so far In [this interview](https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/1/21181698/never-rarely-sometimes-always-eliza-hittman-abortion-stories-films-interview), the director mentions that she left the culprit purposefully ambiguous. Not really, in my opinion. She just came off as an extremely shy and awkward girl, which she probably is in real life, especially considering this is her first role. So no I don’t believe it was acting, I think she’s just genuinely awkward and weirdly shy I didn't find it political. It's the reality of abortion-seeking women. And women more broadly, in relation to creepy men. [deleted] >And also what was the dad saying to the dog?

I just watched the film (and had to replay this wtf scene to put the subtitles on).

He's rubbing the dog's belly with his right hand, then reaches with his left hand down towards the dog's hind legs (not in a petting way, but in a creepy 'reaching for something' way). The camera quickly cuts to Autumn making a clearly disturbed look. Not sure if it was inferred that he rubbed more than just the dog's belly, but either way that guy was creepy AF...  

Here's the complete scene dialog from the subtitles, and I noted where the above occurred:

Ted
>Hey. Hi.

>[sets bottle down]

>At least someone in this house loves me.

> That's a girl.
> 
> Who's a good girl, hmm?
> 
>[reaches towards the dog's hind legs]
> 
Yeah, you like that.
> 
> You little slut.
> 
> Who's a little slut?

Mother:
>Stop.

Ted:

> What? She likes it.

> [dog whimpers]

> That's a girl.

>[Ted chuckles]

>Look how easy she is.

At the end, even the poor dog has a worried & creeped-out-AF look on its face... >why did the crisis pregnancy centre lie about how far along Autumn was? 

Why do you think? Is the country of Trump. And I'm saying this as somebody that is not really 100% in favor of non-rape non-medical danger abortions, and I think that the movie is misandrist. But in some places some medical professionals do things that are clearly unethical (like lie, or even call the police) to women that want to have an abortion. In my country they have called judges and put young women in jail for abortions that were absolutely inside the local law. The dad was ""joking"" around about the dog being a slut because she liked having her belly rubbed. It was so stupid and unfunny. I just watched the film today and walked away thinking it was really good, I completely missed the aspects you pointed out and you're absolutely right.

Maybe it was a reflection of the perception that Autumn and Skylar had of the people around them?

Their life is filled with abusive relationships both at home and at work,  I've never been good at analyzing movies but maybe we see all the other characters in a dangerous or predatory way because that's the way the girls have grown to view the people and adults around them.

Even the female doctors both in the start of the film and the end are perceived in a way that's kinda of reserved, unsure, standoffish and not trusting. Heck, even the female doctor performing the procedure is shown in a reserved almost callous type of way. You know they are there to good but the film never lets you get comfortable with that feeling, you never feel safe or comfortable with any of the character interactions male or female.

The first doctor seems incredibly caring and kind and for the most part she was, but you still get a sense of betrayal when she makes Autumn watch the religious propaganda abortion film.

They don't trust the adults or the relationships they have in their life, Autumn can't even bring her self to communicate with her mom, it absolutely comes off as male hating at first glance but I think it's more just an untrusting, fearful, cautious and predatory outlook the girls have towards ALL adults, relationships or authority figures in their life.

I could be completely wrong and I'm not super smart at analyzing movies but that's what I took from it at least.

The only person you're ever sure of that's on Autumn's side with no ill intent is Skylar and even that notion falters for a few minutes in the film. not all the men are predators.  the bus driver is a nice man who helps them with their luggage; the security guard supporting the clinic is male; the subway worker is male who offers them directions.  the 3 drummers on the subway are peaceful, talented males who the girls stop and listen to without looking frightened.  the problem u have is that the hero of the film is female, the men take either a background role or that of an antagonist.  get over it, just bc the man doesn't swoop in to save the day doesn't make this film misandrist. Haven't movies earned that depiction at least once? Are you female? Because this movie entirely spoke to my experience as a woman growing up in the United States. The overwhelming majority of my experiences with male strangers is creepy. ""Men are pigs"" is what the world looks like to women. thanks for recommending 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days will definitely check it out. aka filmmaking >Never Rarely Sometimes Always is easily the best film of the year 

Not even close. Have you seen ""Bacurau""? Way more important than this (parable of American imperialism destroying entire countries wins over American teenagers getting an abortion Dardenne brothers' style) and way better filmed. Helene Louvant is one of the best DPs in the game and then a few seconds later the clinic director says the line ""a positive is always a positive"".... well apparently not since they used this fake positive test! what is going on!! She seemed to really dislike Ted so that's why I thought maybe he was abusing her. Yeah, i feel like there HAS to be some meaning behind it, but like...I have no idea what it could be. The only thing I came up with is that they were literally carrying their (emotional) baggage everywhere. Oh it made me feel sick, but I couldn't look away. definite Scene of the Year candidate I fucking hate conservative Christians. That's what's holding this country back from true greatness. What confused me about this was that she was actually 18 weeks and not 10 weeks. I would've thought they'd have lied and said it was farther along to make her think she missed her window for abortion. You think they lied and said it was earlier in the process to trick her into thinking she had time to make the decision instead? Also, it was to show his relationship with sex being routine in the household however, I applaud you for looking out for unequal and unfair portrayals of the sexes..  I imagine you've also commented on every single sexist movie portraying women as passive objects red flagging them as well. Bacurau is a 2019 film and nah, I'd say Never Rarely Sometimes Always is better. He was definitely abusive to her, I just didn’t think it was sexual. That confused me as well, unless they were trying to make her think a 10 week fetus looked bigger and more like a baby? This sarcastic comment is an excellent example of the Tu Quoque fallacy https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Ad-Hominem-Tu-quoque I think the point is that it could've been several. The boy at the diner; her creepy father; the gross grocery store manager who kisses their hands. All of the men in her life are in some way abusive and/or predatory That makes the most sense, I think there's also a possibility they were just not that good at their jobs, as the first time she goes there and takes the equivalent of a walgreens test shows they aren't as professional. Isn’t that what I said? ",0
44,"Was absolutely in love with the lighting in this movie and even the reflections, added so much life to all of it. 22 was literally the 22nd soul in existence, correct? I heard the Jerry's refer to othe baby souls in the billions. [deleted] Seeing Abraham Lincoln getting irrationally angry at Andrew Jackson for being on the 20 dollar bill is something I never thought I wanted to see. if anyone lives in nyc.... this movie was unbelievably touching in its attention to detail. the subway trains, the fences around the little gardens on the sidewalk, the streets, the buildings. even the blue note reference. it was pretty emotional seeing my city bursting with life, especially during these trying times. I loved the contrast between the first time they show all the mundane things Joe does and he says ‘my life was meaningless’ and then the ending montage shows him finding joy in all of those mundane moments. The middle school band playing the When You Wish Upon a Star theme to the Disney Castle intro killed me. 

Also the cutaway to the cat’s soul on the conveyor belt was hilarious Since 22 is on Earth now that means she can’t fuck with the Knicks anymore right? Knicks winning in 2021 lets gooooooo The animation was next level. I love the choices they made for the abstract characters. That aerial shot of NYC with Central Park is one of most incredible frames ever imo. To just live is enough. Such a great message. Life being full of ups and downs is OK. The journey is better than the destination. Live in the now. I dig it.

Tears were had.
Plus it had a cat falling face flat onto the floor. So this man really performed a whole Jazz concert with an open lollipop, a pizza crust, and a half eaten bagel in his pocket. Can’t believe pizza rat made a cameo I see a lot of people crying foul with how abruptly it ends. I felt that the ending was designed to be ambiguous. 

It's not about what career path that Joe chooses.

It's about the fact that *whatever* career he chooses, he'll be living life to its fullest.

He starts off as a man unable to walk down the street without getting killed because of his massive tunnel-vision, and he ends as a man who has learned to embrace the present.

I dug that they went with an ambiguous ending. Many other animated films would have spelled things out for the audience.

This one trusts the viewer.

Edit- The filmmakers actually cited multiple different endings that they tried. Here's a link:

https://wdwnt.com/2020/12/pixar-considered-several-different-endings-for-soul/ On a side note, that bug-zap sound effect when souls entered the Great Beyond was absolutely fucking horrifying. 22's lost soul inner dialogue was a whole mood and I identified a little TOO well with those voices in her head. I'm genuinely interested to see if kids like this movie. I can usually separate the two in Pixar movies where there's the kid's movie and the parts for grown-ups sewn into it. This feels distinctly the opposite - there's the cat/guy buddy movie, sure, but it really mainly feels like a movie for adults with kid stuff thrown in

Edit: I LOVED the movie, and I think it's an interesting move for Pixar, potentially starting a push toward making mainstream animation for older audiences - I wish this was in theaters (not just because it's gorgeous to watch) so that we could see how it did monetarily compared to others. It's almost like something Laika would do, but Pixar At the end of the credits you Terry comes out and yells “the movies over! Go home!” Even though everybody is home I just want to give a shout out to Terry.  Just an unappreciated cosmic accountant trying to do their job the best they can. The scene toward the end of Joe remembering seemingly insignificant yet beautiful moments of everyday life was the highlight for me. Really thought he'd realize his spark would be teaching. Good overall. This movie's portrayal of jazz is astounding. The call and responses between Joe and Dorothea in their first song, to the blues of the next, to the swing of the next, just took everything about the genre that I adored.

Connie going to Joe (really 22) to tell him how much she hates band, followed by her saying how much it sucks, playing a minute-long solo, and then deciding to stick with it, with 22-Joe just saying ""hey you're really good at that"" was such a teenager thing to do. Loved that moment especially.

When they showed Joe playing in front of his father, with him just nodding to the music with his eyes closed, I was practically bawling. It was just the silent approval of Joe's calling that his father seemed to notice struck all kinds of nerves.

10/10. Amazing in all aspects. ""Hands are hard!""

I'm sure they are, considering how insanely impressive the hand movements in this movie are during the musical instrument scenes. 

Cute inside joke!

Also, **Pizza Planet Truck** is in the Hall of Everything. Still can’t get over how gorgeous it looked, I swear NYC looked photorealistic at times. It's all clear now why the Knicks suck so bad The message of ‘your spark isn’t your purpose in life, it’s what makes you want to live’ was one that hit me right in the existential gut. The knicks joke was hilarious. 

But also man what a movie, the Jerry’s were hilarious. Pretty sure one of them was a headspace guy. Very deep movie, well made and a great combination of entertainment and depth Shout outs to Rachel House who absolutely knocked it out of the park as meticulous bureaucratic stickler Terry. Great comedic delivery, stole the scene every time for me.

""aw yeah, Terry Time..."" That scene of Joe playing while he has flashbacks of all the beautiful, tiny moments in life (feet on the beach, enjoying a great dessert, etc.) will go down as one of the all-time best Pixar scenes, mark my words. Such a beautiful depiction of the film’s message that life isn’t always about being hyper passionate about something and making your life revolve around it, you can be perfectly fulfilled by just enjoying the beauty of life, and that’s a message I really needed to hear.

Definitely a top 5 Pixar film for me, which is a huge accomplishment for the studio that has most of my favorite films! [deleted] Absolutely loved it. I wasn't expecting that between this and WW84, Soul was the movie I wished I could have seen on the big screen. That scene where 22 (in joe's body) is sitting outside on the steps watching the people nearby, and the leaves in the wind, with that little leaf falling to her hand, just enjoying her life, teared me up, not gonna lie. I cant get over the lighting in this movie. I feel Pixar made a huge jump in general with this movie in regards to animation, but the lighting looked as close to real life as I could imagine an ""animated"" movie being. WOW Pixar has done it again. I was waiting for something on par with Inside Out (Pixar’s best imo) and this gets in that ballpark. Just wow. How many times is Pixar gonna make this grown man learn something about himself

The scene where Joe is looking through all of the dark mentors that caused 22’s soul to be lost and at the end he sees himself... chills man

The movie was also clearly taking a stab at the education system (You Seminar). Criticizing its failure in actually finding student’s “spark”. Making sure we place a bigger emphasis on experience rather than education

I also loved how this movie struck a balance in its message. Usually movies cater to the “follow your dreams, not what society/school tells you to follow” audience , but this movie takes it a step further and says, “be careful in following your dreams, dont become so obsessed and arrogant about them that you miss out on the simpler things”. So fucking good man

Also, that ending sequence where Joe sees all the memories that made his life worth living, that shit was straight out if American Beauty. Made me shed a tear Having Graham Norton as a hippy soul pirate/spiritual sign twirler was the greatest Xmas present I ever received Am I the only one who feels bad for Robert, the pianist who almost got the quartet gig instead of Joe? Hopefully he had the same epiphany about life & not being obsessed with one purpose I felt Pixar finally got the signoff to say the word hell and they were trying to get their money's worth Anybody else think the 14 minute credit sequence would have a post credit scene? When Joe Gardner is playing the piano at his home near the end of the film, he has all the stuff 22 collected scattered on the top, and he just remembers his whole life. 

Memories that seems small, but mean so much more when you really think about it. 

This year has been more than difficult, and we take a lot of things for granted. 2020 has been life changing. 

So seeing Joe just remember the simplest of things, and loving every second of it was beautiful. 

That scene hit differently, moreso than even Pete Docter or Kemp Powers intended.

10/10 ""You can't crush a soul here, that's what Earth is for"" /r/2me4meirl. Also it's suitably crushing that all of the woes of the Knicks are due to 22 (and James Dolan).

Also the intro felt like Disney's take on the [Fox recorder intro](https://youtu.be/XCPj4JPbKtA) 22 landed in the middle of Nepal or some shit. Hope she turns out ok Soul is a very good movie. It kinda showed me the meaning of life. Classic Pixar movie where I felt like life is worth living after watching it.
Also the barbershop was pretty good representation as expected from the trailer I noticed the camera ever so slightly and gently moving in some scenes, giving the film a much more natural feel; like someone is holding a camera. It occurred to me during the barbershop scene, and now I'm having a crisis trying to think if this is new for animation or if they've done this before and I've only just realised! I can’t remember the last time I resonated with someone more than I did when Joe was running away screaming “why aren’t you running!?” And the one soul just shrugs his shoulders I actually liked how the ending ended abruptly. Shows how we don’t know what Joe will do now because he himself doesn’t know what he’ll actually do, but just enjoy his life. 

Also, shouldn’t that cat be dead because it was seen he was going into the great beyond? Pixar should be arrested for murdering every Knicks fan on the planet This film floored me in many many ways... but that score from Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Jon Batiste!

It’s crazy to me that out of all the characters in the film, whenever Terry’s theme would play, you would automatically know who it was. That honestly shouldn’t come as no surprise from Reznor & Ross, but they really outdid themselves with this one. 

It has a sense of euphoria to it, yet it’s playful, then it’s intense, and then it makes you bawl like a damn baby. I don’t know how they do it, but they seem to do it every time! I can’t see kids really enjoying this movie. But it felt like therapy for me and really challenged the way I think about things. I love how philosophical it was. So creative and thought provoking and exactly what we need in cinema right now! One of the best movies of the year. Loved the scene where Joe in the cat can’t stay awake in the sun For some reason it really bugged me that he took a cab from the hospital to his apartment, but he had no money.

Cabbies in such competing with Uber that they're giving free rides now? The show with Dorothea was such a great scene. I was on the edge of my seat, expecting something to go wrong, for him to blank under the pressure or something. But when the concert goes fantastically, afterwards we see that the problem was that it DID meet expectations: it was awesome. So then the problem is ""now what?"" Or ""was that it?"". In the end we realize the message - that living in the moment and letting go of great expectations of destiny is the way to see the true beauty of life. All accompanied by that sweet sweet JAZZ. Wow OKAY BUT WHICH SOUL HAS BEEN FUCKING WITH THE DETROIT LIONS ALL THIS TIME Watched this movie with my mom, and when Joe starts remembering his whole life and realizes that the little moments are what makes life worth living - the whole point of the movie - my mom goes “Why is he remembering these things now? What’s this got to do with anything?” And I just thought I’d share that because it’s such a Mom thing to say. This movie was absolutely fantastic. It really hit it out of the park and I think it’s cool Disney sort of bit a bullet here and released what is obviously a huge production film to streaming. Everything about the film was a home run and my god the animation was out of this world. I don't think this movie would have hit as hard if I weren't depressed. A few weeks ago, I would have killed myself if I had the nerve to do it. Recently, I've just felt more indifferent towards life. I wouldn't have cared if something killed me. This movie, though... This movie made me want to keep on living. There is no true purpose in life besides just living - and living is beautiful. I haven't felt this way for months - if anything, my head has been exactly like 22's was close to the end of the movie since this summer. I truly hated myself and life until now. It made me cry and cry and cry at the end, but in a good way for once. This movie has made an impact on me like nothing else recently has been able to, and I applaud it for that. Thank you, Pixar, for showing me why life is worth living. *Finally accomplishes his dream.*

Joe- ""I thought it'd feel different.""

Dorothea- ""There's this story. A young fish tells an old fish, ""I want to reach the ocean."" The old fish says, ""Young fish, the ocean is *water.*"" The young fish responds, ""I know, but I wanna reach the *ocean.*""

Joe stands there dejected.

Dorothea- See you tomorrow. (She gives him a wry smile, as if she knows that every night is a grind)

That shit got me good. Joe realizes that his life has already started a long time ago. Reaching his dream wasn't the beginning of it. 

There was no magic pill that was ever going to make him feel fulfilled.

The only way out was to embrace the life that was already around him. 

As an artist, I felt that hard. Always imagining that there would be a 'day' when I would be famous. 

Until realizing that there would be no 'day.' The grind never stops. Life doesnt stop just because you 'made it.'

And Joe had to reckon with the notion of, ""what now?"" This movie was exactly what I needed right now. 

Throughout this year, I’ve been wrestling with feelings of inadequacy and anxiety about trying to jumpstart my career during Covid, fixating on the successes of people I graduated with, and making sure I’m productive enough so that I don’t throw away my potential. I feel like so many of us allow our passions to become toxic obsessions and take over our identities. 

I found that my success in my field or lack thereof came to determine my self-worth, and this movie teaches a valuable lesson in not missing out on the life that happens in between. I rewatched ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ with the family yesterday, and this is a worthy companion piece. I have no idea if kids are gonna understand what the fuck is happening in this movie, but as an adult man I am glad to have it in my life.

Pete Docter and Pixar know just how to poke me right in the feels every time. They can’t keep getting away with it.

Also damn RIP Knicks fans lmao One of my favorite Pixar movies ever. Just so good on every level. I would have loved to see this in theaters. Am I reading this wrong or is Terry (the death accountant) voiced by a woman? Very surprised, was sure it was a man's voice If you had told me 4 years ago that my drunk prediction of Tina Fey being the reason the Knicks suck, I would have institutionalized you on the spot. This may be the most existential movie Pixar released to date. The scene where it pans out to the entire universe just shows how we really aren’t anything other than small organisms in space and should just enjoy the short time we have in this universe. The trying to hail a taxi as a black man in NYC is gonna be one of the most adult jokes Pixar has ever done. Towards the end I finally realized the “catch 22” as they tried to catch 22. Your life has purpose when you give your life purpose. Joe was so focused on his goal of being successful in Jazz, so that his life could start, that it shaded his memories of the rest of his life. Moments unrelated to his jazz career felt like moments of failure to him. Meanwhile he minimized the pain that his journey for a jazz career caused him, because of his passion for it. So when he and 22 are in his memory hall, it shows some memories that should/could be positive ones as sad, and he is surprised to see some of the jazz memories are not so positive when he sees the specifics. Later on at the end when he is realizing his life was always happening, and there were always good things in it, he re-sees some of the memories that had felt sad to him (i.e. eating a piece of pie), with a new gratitude that shows him life is worth living, not just for jazz.  I could go on and on about the message of this movie and how beautiful and meaningful it is. Loved this movie. [deleted] This movie hit me in my existential crisis. Almost reaching my 30s (still young, I know), with no real purpose in sight, dealing with depression and struggling to find any meaning in my existence...I think I needed this movie and the message it's trying to send.






You gotta give meaning to those little moments, as trivial as they may seem, because even if you think that you don't have a place in this world that's definitely not true. Life is worth living, it can be hard to realize it sometimes I know, but it's worth it. Thank you again Pixar, you managed to bring tears to my soul once again. [deleted] Absolutely blown away by this. Gave it a shot with our 6 year old girl and she was asking questions in the first few minutes. Wife and I were like uuuuuuuuh. This was just such a deep look at life. Held back the usual Pixar tears at the end. There was so much to unpack I can’t wait for more viewings. That one scene where he's playing the piano with all of the objects from 22's day in front of him and he was FEELING the emotions SHE felt. That childlike bliss and wonder that modern society and the 9-5 grind tends to make you forget about. And then he was able to flashback and remember moments in his life when he was in the moment again, and how beautiful they are. 

That hit me like a ton of bricks. Probably the most beautiful Pixar scene. I'm still slow crying, it's like it threw me back to the moment where I realized and remember those childlike feelings of bliss and awe and then had my own flashbacks of moments in my life that meant the world to me. It happened on a deep shroom trip and I'm forever thankful for that and I'm forever thankful for this movie for reigniting that. Unreal. I attempted suicide a couple weeks ago due to a LOT of things (not having a purpose in life, trauma, losing a relationship that spanned almost a decade, etc) and just got out of the psych ward and I..... god. This movie was so visceral to me. I remember the cold wind hitting my body as I stepped out of the psych ward for the first time. I felt actually cold, not slightly colder than room-temperature due to wearing short sleeved scrubs cold. I felt the sun, I saw it, not fluorescent lighting in my room and in the hallway that got turned off at night. I realized I’d been alive but never *lived in the moment*, never felt alive. I felt like I was a new person dropped into my body, as I shivered in the street clothes I had tried to kill myself in the week prior. I felt like.... I felt so much in that moment. I still do. I can feel myself falling back into my old depressive patterns, but shit. 


Pardon me. I’ve been crying since I finished the movie 10min ago and writing this made me cry more. That poor kitty soul getting kicked out and sent to heaven!

*Sad meow* I went into this movie fully expecting to end up bawling. And while I did cry a bit (when 22 as Joe gave his speech to his mom about if I die today will my life have been worth living?), I honestly have never felt so optimistic finishing a movie. As a single guy in his late 20s still doing his best living through a pandemic and trying to be happy while I see everyone’s achievements of marriages and kids and trying to pursue your one passion, a movie who’s message was “it’s ok if you don’t know what your passion is. Live your life, even the simple things can give you purpose.” Really hit hard. Maybe we need a passion, maybe we don’t, but the ups and downs of life along the way make your life passionate. Honestly I’ve never felt this way from a movie. 

My only complaint is that Daveed Diggs has like three lines. Also I’m glad I didn’t pay 30 bucks to see this, but it would’ve been worth it. The rat with the pizza made me lol Okay but what happened to dr borgensson??? This is, by far, the best rendition of New York City in any animated movie that I’ve ever seen.

The Pixar crew absolutely nailed the following things that every animated movie (and most live-action ones) miss, usually by a mile:


-	the little shops in Queens
-	Basically Queens in general
-	*dirt on the subway walls*
-	subway *routes* (Joe lives in Queens. He takes the M to go home. The M ends in Ridgewood, which is in Queens. He also takes the 7 from the school that he works at, which connects to the M at Court Square...which Soul also nails with the curve off near Silvercup)
-	the *propulsion sound* of the new subway trains (which the 7 uses, but they animated an older train...which I can forgive)
-	the stream of lights that you see in the subway tunnels as you are moving
-	the annoying fucking spinner things that fall from trees, and
-	the tiny ass apartment that most people actually live in

My wife and I moved away four years ago. This is the first movie that made me miss NYC. It’s the little things I miss, and Soul fucking nailed them. I saw many comments on Pixar subreddit that they wanted a longer ending, montage of Joe’s and 22’s lives or something like that.

I think ending is brilliant. It isn’t a film about overcoming some kind of obstacle after which your life would be purposeful and great, so we can see our characters living happily after that. 

It’s about realizing life happens in every moment, that you won’t find your meaning in one particular moment but in realizing that every day is special and not to be taken for granted.

Didn’t think Pixar would done it again, thought no way this could be close to Inside Out or Coco. I was wrong.

Thank you Docter. Thank you Pixar. One of my favourite small details was when 22 said Marie Antoinette was one of her mentors and she was just a floating head. Did anyone else notice that Joe wasn’t in the zone when he was playing onstage? It was only after he returned to his apartment and saw all of the trinkets that 22 collected that he finally reached that point of Zen. Movie made me cry on antidepressants in an airplane 10/10 The subway busker 22 is drawn to is Cody Chesnutt, best known for his collaboration with The Roots, performing his song [Parting Ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nV0effwQYw&ab_channel=DisneyMusicVEVO), a song that existed only as this live recording from [Dave Chappelle's Block Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btq3nRBCT5k&ab_channel=FunkSoulTV). I had hoped for many years to hear a studio quality version, and was so happily surprised to hear it pop up here. did anyone realize that they show the therapy cat entering the great beyond, but when Joe leaves the cat's body and enters into his own body the cat still has life. which means Terry the accountant was off by 2 souls. suck it Terry the accountant. Something I read on IMBD. Thought this was cool.

*Pixar was mindful of the history of racist imagery in animation, and set out to create characters who were recognizably black while avoiding the stereotypes in old cartoons. Acknowledging this effort, Peter Docter stated that ""There's a long and painful history of caricatured racist design tropes that were used to mock African-Americans."" According to Kemp Powers, the animators used lighting as a way to highlight the ethnic diversity in the living world. Pixar sought to capture the fine details of these black characters, including the textures of black hair and the way light plays on various tones of black skin. Cinematographer Bradford Young worked as a lighting consultant on the film* I hate being this cynical, but did anyone else think, ""It's precisely *because* Joe got his dream gig that he can now smell the roses of everyday life? Because he's now free from the everyday angst and struggle of a life unfulfilled?""

Just me? All of the best Pixar movies start with a main character dying, change my mind Now that 22 has found her body, The Knicks might have a chance this year!! This was nice to watch after seeing Wonder Woman on Christmas day

I really thought Joe would realize his spark was teaching music. Or he would be OK with dying instead of taking the second chance.

It would have been cool to see human 22. I'd think that's a stretch though The soul at the You Seminar who said ""I am a manipulative megalomaniac who is intensely opportunistic"" reminded me of someone I think it’s bullshit when people talk about the best filmmakers working today, Pete Docter is almost never brought up. He continues to be one of the most innovative and brilliant filmmakers working today.  I was floored by this. Absolutely beautiful. This movie made me cry more than any Pixar movie before it. Especially at the point when Jerry asked Joe what he is going to do with his life and he said “Live every minute of it”. My mom cried as well.

It might be because I’ve seen part of myself in Joe, waiting for your life to begin and fixating on a particular moment or event that you think will happen at some point. This movie was better than it should have been. The animation detail is becoming so good that you can’t tell it’s a Pixar film if you remove the characters with their caricature proportions. Otherwise stills could pass as photos.

I’m enjoying Pixar toying with big questions of mortality and purpose. This experiment within the crossroads of black culture, jazz, and “life’s purpose” play out fairly well - the jokes don’t go on too long, the seriousness of the film sits well between lighthearted frame-altering conversations, and seeing the value of black communities really made this film more of a standout than I guessed.

Not in a rush to rewatch but will tell everyone I’m close to to watch it. 

Way better than WW1984. As a die hard NY sports fan, the Knicks joke hit me right in the feels... I haven’t seen this take yet. 

But. 

The first Jerry mentions that she is a being beyond the comprehension of humanity. So what we see is a form that we can comprehend. Our minds kind of mash her into the shape that she’s in so she makes sense to us. (Literally how the true form of Pennywise works, which is hilarious)

Anyways. 

The form they take is like cubism. In cubism artists try to step beyond the theory of forms to represent a subject from as many viewpoints as possible. 

The being we cannot comprehend is smashed into a form that is every possible view of the form itself. The object without form, is represented by being every form. 

That’s a really neat philosophical/art reference I enjoyed. Haven’t seen it mentioned yet. 

Amazing flick. Cried four times. Love jazz. I was doomed from the beginning. Before I begin this hastily typed ""review"", I will preface with this: I understand that this movie is made for Western audiences, and that it is a kids film. 

Upon finishing the film, I was left wondering whether 22 would have arrived at her ultimate feelings about living if she'd instead had been placed inside the body of a person living in destitution in the slums of, say, a city in India. Statistically, a great number of the souls falling out of the Great Before and down into Earth will end up living in severe poverty, many starving throughout their life. This even applies to many living in New York City. Now, I'm not trying to put down people who live in these situations, and I'm sure many would say that they still enjoy their life overall (everything is relative, right?). However, a single man who had a good upbringing and can afford to live an expensive American city (i.e., Joe) is living a quality of life much better than the quality of life that billions of people experience—Joe's life wasn't a fair representation of what 22 could likely expect living a life on Earth. 

What's my point in writing this all up? Well, I certainly don't consider myself a nihilist or antinatalist, so I'm not trying to say that 22 shouldn't have jumped into Earth. Nevertheless, I think the message of the movie was a little off. Instead of making the moral of the story be that one should simply focus on their journey in life, not the destination (if I'm misrepresenting the moral, please let me know), I think there could have been an acknowledgement that not everybody's going to have a journey in life that affords them the opportunities to enjoy a lot of the nice things Joe does like playing the piano, eating a slice of pie in a diner, have parents who love you, etc., and that perhaps this means that people like Joe **should** have a purpose in life: making the world a better place so that every soul on Earth is actually able to enjoy life in the way that Joe inevitably is able to do. 

Perhaps that's a little too deep for a kids film, but I think they could have incorporated this idea by having Joe realize that his teaching job is a way to influence others' lives in a positive way. Or maybe he discovers that playing live music is an excellent way to bring joy into other people's live. Instead, the message at the end of the film seems very self-centered; Joe is left really only caring about *his* life and *his* enjoyment of it. There's just too much focus on individualism and not enough on what we as humans can do to make sure that everyone's soul maintains that spark that allows them to truly enjoy life. 

With all that said, I recognize that Soul was produced by mega-corporation Disney, and so I could never really see such a message existing in its films. I think they missed the opportunity to make it obvious that performing wasn't how he should use his spark, he should have been teaching music and inspiring kids - I was sure that was where it was going, after he ""helped"" 22 find her spark.. As someone who is terrified of the uncertainty of what the ""great beyond"" holds, I was so ready to leave this movie with a sense of existential dread. Instead, I'm just a depressed lost soul whose life is meaningless and has no spark. Thanks, Pixar! You ever just watch a movie, and you know it changed you? Soul did that for me.

The realization that your spark isn't your purpose in life, was by far one of the greatest messages a film has delivered in a long time. Just because you love doing something, that isn't what makes you, you. And I think we can all learn from this and this is by far, one of, if not the, greatest pieces of animation I have seen.

The music, the animation, the humor, and the overall tone of the movie hit all the right places for me, and I will be rewatching this again and again. I loved it and was thoroughly surprised that Mr. Mittens wasn't Joe's cat. I mean, he was apart of every piece of merchandise, I just thought it was funny that he wasn't a bigger part of Joe's life.

Not to mention Dorothea's fish metaphor really stuck with me. Everyone thinks that they'll be happy when they finally get something they don't have, but true happiness comes from where you are now. All that matters in life, is to live every second of it. 

If you love great music, great animation, and a great overall message that you can carry for the rest of your life, go see this movie. I was down voted one time for [predicting](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/j7muyh/z/g85y760) that Jamie Foxx turns into the cat. Look what happened now! VINDICATION!!! As a librarian, I felt personally attacked by that librarian scene in the hall of everything. God damn if it wasn’t right though lol. Did the appearance of the “Lost Souls” feel Ghibli-like to anybody else? DANMIT PIXAR,  Do You need ANOTHER Oscar? You just shot and killed Wolfwalkers time to shine. Why did you have to make one of your  best in years right when Cartoon saloon had it right in the bag right bag, and you had to take right out their fucking hands agin.

&#x200B;

I'm mad, becuse this is one of the best of the year, and was really hoping someone else would win for a change!

(Still I love this movie) Id also like to add this was definitely the Pixar movie I think we all needed after what 2020 was i ate 2 grams of mushrooms not too long ago and watched this movie. very good choice. cried a lot. a spark isn’t a purpose and that’s okay. life just is. Absolutely adored this.

HOWEVER, I think it's criminal that they didn't let Joe die in the end. They just had to have a happy ending for everyone. Oh well, it was still a wonderful experience. The philosophy was expressed on a story level. Perhaps controversially, I think them giving Joe a second chance is a bit of a cop out. I think he should have died at the end, but I understand why he didn't being a kids movie and all. Not what I expected, and that's a good thing. 
One of the best movies I think I've seen in quite some time. 

I can also say that I love me some Trent and Atticus, and once again they delivered. 

I'm so happy that the only trailer I watched didn't spoil anything. 

Go watch this. Now.

I'm also glad we watched this after eating edibles. I think kids below 18 years of age wouldn't get it, maybe people over mid 20s or so would fully appreciate the movie That little antijoke at the beginning when he is walking very carelessly but walks over banana peels without slipping. A thought on names— might all the counselors who nurture the seeds from which our souls grow be named Jerry, short for Germination, or Genesis? And Terry, the accountant of our end, be named after Termination or Terminus? Great movie.  Different than most Pixar movies and they took a risk.  I love it.  Great themes to discuss with the kids afterwards. The story Dorthea Williams said really resonated with me. 

Sometimes when you reach your goal and get to the top of the mountain, you forgot why you wanted to get there in the first place. When you do get there, you never plan on what you need to do next. But thats it though. There doesn't need to be a next. Where you are now is enough. You can't force or make yourself feel bad for not getting to the next highest step, you just gotta take in what you have and had

Yeah, this is the ocean and its just water but it doesn't mean you should squander that water you live in To the people criticising the film for >!giving Joe another chance at life;!< It seemed to me like The Great Beyond was where the souls went to be 'pressed back into form'. After the souls had lived they looked like their bodies but all the new-borns were identical shapes. So, I imagine its where the souls get recycled - tying into the whole intention of the film; that it's about the journey not the destination. 

Also, people can have near-death experiences. It’s interesting that Joe’s mother isn’t notified about his accident. You’d think she’d be listed as an emergency contact at the hospital, but that small detail could also say a lot about their relationship. 22  is the next Dalai Lama It's good that Joe didn't die. It's weird to show someone voluntarily choosing death in a movie meant to celebrate the gift of life. The one thing that stuck out to me the  most, is how this film kinda forms a thematic trilogy with Coco and Inside Out

All three movies' messages and themes kinda weave into each other. Put them all together, and you get an amazing celebration of life, including its highs and lows.

I hardly think it was intentional, which is a testament to how Pixar fully owns the art of storytelling. I watched it with my mom, she asked me questions like ""Are you happy with your life?, do you feel enjoyment?"" and while I answered yes, after watching the whole thing, I sort of felt like I don't actually feel happiness with where I am currently. I don't have a passion at the moment and it really scares me.

That aside, 10/10 movie, was really amazing, especially the after credits scene. I don’t know if this has been said but I like that they used the number 22. It’s an age where a lot of people feel lost about their “purpose”. Don’t know if that was intentional or not. The barber shop scene was amazing Really great movie. Being black male who grew up in NYC, a lot of it really hits home for me. The final scenes were really touching - that part with the leaf inside 22's lost soul in particular. Also loved the shade thrown at the Knicks and Trump. This movie left me feeling down for a few hours connecting it to my own life. Recently started college and I’m afraid that once I get the job I always wanted, I realize that doesn’t make me feel any different. However I am enjoying the small things in life Absolutely loved it, the moment when 22-Joe is sitting on the step watching the tree blow in the wind made me feel the same way I feel when I'm out on a hike.

Definitely going to watch it again, and I'm sure as a result head out for a hike this weekend as well. It's really a shame this movie doesn't get to hit theaters. Pixar has outdone themselves this time, honestly one of the best things they have ever put out. Whoever included Jack Kirby in 22's wall of inspirational mentors, I appreciate the hell out of you. Surprised I dont see more people talking about the scene where Joe is arguing with his mom and it transitions from him as the cat telling 22 what to say to showing Joe actually talking, that was a super cool way to show that happening. I thought this movie was great. I thought the animation really blew me away. This is the first time I think that pixar animated people to look natural. 

In Up or Wall e they moved like cartoons in a movie. Here when they were in NYC they moved and acted like real people. 

The hospital scenes looked like they were actually in a hospital. I see a lot of people saying how this movie was really good in how it helped them and how it might help see through a depression by saying how a spark isn't your purpose, it's your reason to live and whatnot.

I loved this movie, but honestly everything depressed me. I accomplished nothing in life, which I know goes against what the movie was trying to say, but it just makes me feel even worse about it.... Christ. I went into this movie blind other than “jazz and feelings from music”. 
This movie had NO BUSINESS being this metaphysical. Well, it’s literally the name, so I guess it does lol. 

Straight 10/10 for me. I feel so personally attacked. I have a passion for music, I feel like it’s one of my only “sparks” or will to live. Went through what I thought would be a career but left me feeling suffocated. Music lets you be free from all that. I’m getting close to my 30s and I still feel like I’m so directionless in life. Nothing feels good enough to be called a true path in life. So this movie was spot-on relatable. From Joe’s and 22’s perspective. 

So.. I’ve recently had a.. “metaphysical trip” (lol) and it all came down to.. nameless ants. In a society. Working in a straight line like we’re supposed to do. But some branch out and do what they want as opposed to being a mindless drone. Mine was music. 

I truly FELT what Joe was feeling whenever he played music and got into the zone. The color of his aura was spot on. The fact that you’re just a spirit in the brain of a body is TOO damn deep for a Pixar movie I watched spur of the moment. It plays the metaphysical card SO hard, and so well. It makes you feel.. hopeless, but hopeful. Life. Souls. Purpose. Pixar.

-End Spoilers ahead-
. 
. 
The end of the movie was open for interpretation. I think that’s why I loved it so much. 
It could be the deep Pixar route. One soul finds another soul as a friend. Play the rest of the movie. 
Or it could be perceived as super existential. Joe had an accident, went on life support with drugs. Had a “mental breakdown” or what people would say is just a crazy trip. Had a truly out of body experience and we were there for the insanity and truth. 22 was his inner feelings coming to light and them finding their purpose was also Joe finding his will to live. 

They didn’t prove otherwise.

So I’m happy they kept it open-ended. Provokes the mind into deep thought. And honestly, if a movie can truly accomplish that and make me tune out the rest of the world, it’s a 10/10.
A trip without the trip lol I get how the message was great for all of us, but did anyone think this was definitely the most adult themed movie so far?

I don't have kids, but I feel like they wouldn't have really identified with much of the plot or the message. I'm about to enter the Air Force and this movie couldn't cut deeper. I'm 19 and felt like I wasted my life (even though I'm still so young) because I worry I'll die one day and not have accomplished anything. Learning that it's okay to take things slow and just enjoy what you're doing know was what I needed to hear. I don't really wanna care about the movie's technical errors or whatever, all I know is that this felt like mini therapy. The gags with 22 and historical figure were hilarious each time. 

Question though: Joe inhabited the cat, who we see heading to the Great Beyond, but then at the end, Joe gets his body back and the cat is still alive. So the cat isn’t part of Terry’s count then I suppose? Calling it now: this is going to get some serious Oscar noms like Picture and Screenplay. It's my favorite film of the year, so maybe that's just wishful thinking. The movie was eh.

I think it's because the set up was weak. The initial conflict came from him finally on the verge of ""making it"" in the business, but we were never there for the struggle and passion. We were simply told for a few minutes that it was his life's spark. Then we're jerked away from it by all of a sudden landing dead in purgatory?

The world of souls also never felt like there was any heart in it. Birth and death are things that inspire spirituality and deep emotions, and I felt like Coco did this beautifully. There was so much detail and color. It took only a glance to feel and see that it was a rich, vibrant world.

In Soul, everything you see feels so plain in comparison. It's an assembly line managed by abstract cosmic beings who randomly assign personalities. While not dealing with birth or death, Inside Out does an excellent job of playing around with deep subjects of loss, transformation, and complex emotion and even lightly touching on concepts we're familiar with: random jingles that play in our heads, dreams, lost memories, trains of thought, abstraction, imagination. Soul does not build this world well at all.

And to skip ahead, after every painstaking effort Joe goes through to play with Dorothea, he just doesn't ""feel it"" anymore? In the beginning of the film, we see him come alive when he plays for his students and at his audition with Dorothea. It's never clear what the relationship was between a newfound appreciation for what we many of us may dismiss or mistake for ""plain living"" and a passionate pursuit of a dream.

The film falls apart at that point for me.

Side note: The land of lost souls was such an interesting topic, and I wish they had given this more loving attention. Becoming mired in doubt and meaningless endeavors or getting lost in ""flow"" can both lead to a loss of connection with the world. This needed more emotion.

Just one nobody's opinion, but I was underwhelmed by this movie. I liked it, I figured out that halfway through he was going to realize his true passion was teaching. Still an enjoyable fun movie. As an enormous NIN fan, I’d never had believed you if you told me TR would go from lyrics like “I’m going to cum all over you” to composing an absolutely beautiful score for a Disney movie.

He and Atticus Ross continue to amaze me. Massive shout out to John Baptiste as well.

(Tin foil hat side note: Maybe there’s something to NIN’s “Head like a hole, black as your *soul*, I’d rather die, than give you control”...) The scene where Joe is in his apartment reflecting his life thanks his journey with 22 resonated with me deep inside my heart. Its a justaxpostion of the scene where said his life was worthless because he never did anything much with it except chase a dream.. The fact that it doesnt matter if he wasnt successful, or that he couldn't accomplish his dream or that he felt like he didnt have a purpose, but the fact that he is HERE, that he is alive and can expericence the hurt, pain, the joy and happiness, and thats the gift of life.

That scene will never leave me for as long as i live. An incredible movie with stunning animation and even more stunning score. A masterpiece imo. If Joe wasn't originally supposed to mentor 22, then what happened to the other dude???? Finally saw it

Thought it was great. Will probably be up there as far as Pixar movies go. Definitely a tear jerker

The animation in this movie is unbelievable. I particularlly look the art design of the Jerrys

The soundtrack is also unbelievable

Also, I like that they stuck in a song from Joes rap band in the credits After the mixed reviews and statements that pixar hasn't been hitting their best in years I delayed watching this movie. Finally watched it tonight and Soul was freaking fantastic. On a separate note Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross? What a surprise! Explains why the music was so good. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would just like everyone to know that I watched this movie very high without having any context to what the movie was about. think about how painful that was for me. in a good way tho. trying to make sense of the beyond and all that was hard. I haven't cried from movies in a long time, but this one hit me hard. I'm glad I watched this alone. My life has been a trainwreck and this movie let my emotions out. The shine of the instruments was incredible. Thread by one of the animators about how they had to innovate to add shadows to the astral plane (which were not shadows really)

https://twitter.com/levork/status/1342585635257741312?s=19 Yes. It was meant to show she’s been “sparkless” for a very very very long time. [deleted] Yeah that’s what I came here for. I was thinking she’s gotta be like a literal angel. That’s an old soul. If a cave person, it makes since that something simple like a leaf would spark her My theory is she lived as a Dalai Lama or holy person as she was heading for Tibet / Nepal The co-director admitted on Twitter that he is a lifelong Knicks fan and had the joke written in with the argument of “they last won a championship the year I was born, I’m allowed to do this”. The Knicks were also clowned in Madagascar. [Scene here](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/0721c169-294d-4710-b30f-ea10c41598da) , the fact that they can be made fun of in movies that were released 15 years apart is the real indictment on the franchise I totally thought it was going to cut to the team the Globetrotters always ""beat"", and then it cut to the Knicks & I lost it. Funniest part of the movie It carries across to other cities too. It made me miss being in a bustling London so much. This year has been tough. The knicks dig and pizza rat cameo too! My wife is from New York, but has been out for years. She was kind of zoning out until the subway scene. When she heard the sound of the subway speeding up she perked up. It sounded *exactly* right. Neither of us had noticed how distinct that sound is before. > _It was pretty emotional seeing my city bursting with life, especially during these trying times._

My wife and I had the same reaction. I turned to her during the credits and said ""I miss New York."" We actually do live in NY, right now. 2020, oof. The rendering of the West 4 train station was dead on. I liked that we didn't get an answer about whether he stayed in the Quartet or if he realized he was a good mentor/teacher and that he inspired more than one student to keep doing the thing they love. He looked like he enjoyed teaching as much as Connie looked like she loves trombone. 

And we don't see what becomes of 22 because the important part is that we know 22 is living now. I absolutely loved the film's message about people's perception of happiness. Joe sitting alone in the diner loving the pie was really powerful and clever and challenged a few stereotypes. And exploring this theme without wasting real estate on a love interest was even better This movie is a lesson to me, to all of us to appreciate everything around us. You know, you always hear people say that to you, I have been hearing it all my life to enjoy the small things. It never clicked with me like how simply seeing a leaf spin around could make me happy. This movie made me understand it. Seeing a leaf fall to the ground, yeah, isn't the same as being a famous musician but simply seeing something that makes you think ""thats neat"" can truly brighten your life, even for a moment “The job will not save you. It won’t make you whole, it won’t fill your ass up....

A life, you know what that is? It’s the shit that happens while you’re waiting for moments that never come.”

-Lester Freamon Me: I miss the older Pixar Disney castle intros with the super brass-heavy theme

Monkey's paw: *curls* This would be The Good Place Jags started sucking again the moment they mentioned they were good. Lmao as soon as I finished the movie tonight I check Twitter and see that the Knicks won Terry kind of looked like the old Mac OS finder icon They made the city look so alive too. As corny as it is I love NY so much and they did a phenomenal job with the city and the people. Journey before destination, Radiant. One of the few negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes said

>Far from teaching children to follow their dreams, the movie... advocates leaving the dreaming to the pros.

And wow, way for the professional movie viewer to miss the point. I guess they can't let go of the idea that a singular passion is your purpose. Kind of an immature outlook. ""I'll go with you.""
""You know you can't do that.""
""I know, but I'll go as far as I can.""

I was tearing up thinking about the reality of that message. That was the best depiction of what a mentor is trying to do/supposed to be, especially when Joe had to let go. I would have been fine with it ending the way it seemed it would right there, but I still very much enjoyed the movie. Life is what happens when we’re busy making other plans. That's the only way *to* perform a whole Jazz concert. He was just jazzing, you take what's thrown at you and go with it! Out of all the cameos they could've pulled for NYC, that was probably the best.

Godspeed, Pizza Rat.

Godspeed. Remy the Pizza rat Zardulu strikes again! Pizza Rat vs Pizza Cat: the sequel we need That summary with the tunnel vision is great.

He literally dies, because he fails to take in the world in its entirety, because he's so absorbed by his one thing, believing that only this one single thing will make him happy. And then he realizes the simple beauties of life, because those simple beauties just seemed to utterly mesmerize 22, someone who has never experienced life. As such they're already small wonders compared to an existence without feeling, taste, or smell.

The only ""issue"" is maybe that his focus is something rather positive, being a passionate and talented musician. It's a bit difficult to say ""hey don't JUST focus on music"", given how there's so many vices etc. They could have put a bit more emphasis on someone with a nice passion devolving into a shadow thing instead of just doing the stockmarket gag. They split into cmky. I interpreted it as them splitting back into their parts to re join the whole. Imagine the sound designer presenting all of the candidates to their team. The way her memory of Joe's criticism was so much harsher than what he actually said...felt that. Seriously.  I thought the movie had absolutely peaked when joe took all the items 22 left and started playing piano. I was not expecting that sort of existential charity from this movie and it hit me like a freight train.  

But then you had this literal lost soul spiraling out of control and succumbing to this life long anxiety of never being able live up to the expectations everyone around her had set.  That shit hit me in a way I couldn’t explain and I had to take a minute. Real inner-critic-going-hogwild shot right there. Where my depressed defeatist at? The saddest part to me was that once you got past them all yelling at Joe as he tries to reach her, she was making the Joe one yell at herself :( I think Pixar realized this and put in that joke early on.

""Connie knows what I mean, right Connie?""

""I'm 12"" [deleted] My son (3) did not like it and more so, I think it scared him. Not in a boogie man type way but in an existentialism/cosmic dread type of way. 

He’s too young to understand a lot of those themes fully but I think he grasped the gist of it and he was terrified. He was really uncomfortable with the escalator to the afterlife bit. [deleted] I agree. I remember watching The Incredibles as a teenager and coming out of it thinking, ""Why would you make a kid's movie about a man having a midlife crisis? "" but that movie still had silly superhero hijinks for the kids. This movie seems like it's squarely for adults and that's fine too, I suppose. Yeah my kids weren't very into it, they're both under 10. The aesthetic and music aren't very kid friendly to be honest. Jazz is hard for small kids. My kids 13, 11 & 7 barely looked up at the tv lol
I was hooked I watched with my 9 year old son and 6 year old son and both had distinct reactions. My 9 year old (very social and charming/outgoing, loves to make people laugh) LOVED it, as soon as it was over he wanted to remember all the funny parts (when one baby soul pushed another baby soul over, etc). My 6 year old (who is a notably old soul, very smart and sensitive for his age) sniffled a few times during it, when it was over said it was “lame” and went running to his room crying. We had to sit and have a chat about why he was upset (the movie was too sad) and I explained that sometimes it’s good to watch sad things because that makes the happy things so much better! We talked all about the movie and the different things that resonated with him (death, what happens after death, how to live life to the fullest) and by the time we were done he was laughing and happy and said he really loved the movie he just didn’t realize there were going to be sad parts. I ran here after the movie was over because I was so touched and wanted to share how wonderful of a movie it was. Everyone needs to watch it! I feel like they threw that in for everyone waiting for the post credit scene of 22 as a human baby I love that they had a character who was in dogged pursuit of two fugitives trying to live life and picked Rachel House. Skux life! Imagine your only job is to count souls, you finally for the first time in centuries have something interesting happen, and everyone shrugs you off glad he didn't become the villain or anything lol “What’s that?! Look over there immediately!” He deserved that trophy that only he requested! Aint no party like a Terry Time party cause a Terry Time party is 100% accounted for, *down to the last soul* Seriously, stay away from the processed foods. I liked the way his character was portrayed. He’s not some evil villain, he’s just trying to do his damn job. I think Disney is trying to show that good and bad are not necessarily binary traits in a person. Human beings are complex creatures and I really appreciate that Disney is moving towards showing that. A person can be good and be seen as bad at the same time! Which is what it is in real life really. Him taking the award he specifically asked for with complete unironic relish was so, so funny. >Connie going to Joe (really 22) to tell him how much she hates band, followed by her saying how much it sucks, playing a minute-long solo, and then deciding to stick with it, with 22-Joe just saying ""hey you're really good at that"" was such a teenager thing to do. 

That part really hit me in the feels.  Just having a mentor or just someone there to support your passions especially an adult when you are a kid goes a long way.  I remembering as a kid abandoning so many hobbies and passions because I had nobody in my life that supported or encouraged these things.  Only to rediscover those passions when I was older in college when I found a group of peers that did support me and I became mature and confident enough to pursue them on my own. The attention to detail with all the instruments was incredible. Jon Batiste is an incredibly good jazz musician/pianist/composer.

I said this somewhere else in this thread, but his Anatomy of Angels album is fantastic. ([This song is my favorite!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaIu8xwLqV8)) As is his work with Cory Wong ([Home for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB6ng0KBNNw).)

[Also this. He's just such a damn good piano player.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Y03Riw-Us) >	Joe playing in front of his father, with him just nodding to the music with his eyes closed

I missed a couple minutes here or there, but I feel like every time that we saw a memory of Joe’s father it was in the context of jazz music. I wonder if Joe’s attachment to his late father is also part of why he is still always so passionate to the art. They modeled Joe’s hand movements on Jon Batiste Subway car also had 2319 on it. There were a couple scenes that I just straight up forgot I was watching a cartoon. It felt like Roger Rabbit or something where they put animated characters in the real world. I live in NYC, and it’s especially tough at the moment. Lots of people (including most of my friends) have left the city this year. And I’ve thought about it many times. 


But, man- this movie was a beautiful tribute to NYC. It reminded me of what makes NYC so special and makes me want to hold out a bit longer and see what’s in store for the city post-pandemic. That shot of it from the sky literally looked like real life. 

It's insane how far Pixar has come. now who's soul has been ruining my New York Jets for decades? But now that 22 is gone, the Knicks should be good again soon right? But now that 22 is on Earth, Knicks championship incoming? I really really liked that message though, and I think the whole quest to find a greater purpose has left far too many millennials and zoomers completely lost. As someone who struggles with depression that hit me hard.  I was in a pretty dark headspace Christmas eve and then watching Soul this morning with my kids it was more than I could take.  Daddy had to excuse himself for a few minutes. That was my favorite message as well. Hits hard. That Knicks joy killed me - favorite (or maybe second favorite) joke Knicks didn't even play on Christmas and still took an L. Richard Ayoade—he was in the IT Crowd. This movie took LolKnicks to a whole new level Anytime Terry appeared me and the wife would just turn to each other and say “I’m gonna get you Ricky Baker”

Great stuff from her as always And at the same time, the mom and barber characters were there not as villains, but to gently remind us that yes, reality does exist and sometimes you have to take a hard look at your future. 

And that even if you have to sacrifice your dream a bit, you can still live a happy and fulfilling life. Yes! And what I loved about it in particular was the reframing of the diner scene. When Joe was with 22, it was a sign of a lonely,sad life. When seen again at the end, it was all about being in the simple moment of enjoying a damn fine piece of pie. Loved it. The portrayal of the lost souls as your obsessions really hit me hard. As someone who's struggled with OCD, panic disorders, and a history of Sexual abuse i nearly fucking lost it when Joe was going inside 22s demons. 

The way the beings just mope around and act insane was a perfect portrayal of what its like to live in such a world. 

Fucking brilliant movie I’m a musician, and a piano player. And I’ll often have times where I’m working through some emotion or problem, and I’ll just sit down to play. Just making something up that sounds like what I’m feeling. Usually it’s late at night and I’ll have headphones on so as not to bother neighbors. I don’t record it, so it’s just a really intense bit of music and emotion that only I hear, and because I’m making it up no one will ever hear it again. 

That scene is the single most accurate depiction of those moments of my life I’ve ever seen. The music he plays is even similar to the kind of music I play. I’m not a Black man or even that much of a jazz musician, but for that one scene it really was like watching myself. 

I can’t speak for all musicians, but if you wanted a real insight into what my relationship with music is, that scene captures it perfectly. And to be fair, I think we can agree the mom wasn't wrong. He's at least in his mid to late 30's, not married, chasing after a dream, with prior to the school offer no permanent job or health insurance etc. Not to mention she had to monetarily support her husbands dream.

Not that any of that is wrong, but as a mom it's her duty to not coddle him from reality. I was expecting a jump forward by about 10-15 years, and him running into 22 as a human child. Maybe end with him realizing who she is. I'd have liked it if he became one of the mentors in the afterlife, taking care of the newborns, or even the people following their obsessions leading depressed lives.

Nevertheless, the theme was about second chances and finding that spark that makes you look forward to tomorrow. When he was first on the bridge I missed the theatre experience so much. I watched both today. Soul was better then I thought it would be and ww84 wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Yup I came here to say this same thing. I absolutely loved how they focused on the small everyday things we don’t take notice of. For a soul that didn't believe life wasn't worth living on Earth and having been mentored by many great souls, it took an ordinary man like Joe to convince 22 that life on Earth is WORTH living.  And this moment showed it so well and just powerful. My elementary school playground had trees that would shed those little “helicopter seeds” we called them.  We’d gather them in handfuls and throw them into the sky.  Sometimes we’d do it all together and stand under our own shower of spinning seeds. That fucking saxophone looked more real than the one I have right next to me I KNEW IT SOUNDED FAMILIAR. 

what a cast !! When they cut to him furiously spinning his sign, I died I'm so glad they went with Graham Norton, way too many tv host or british accent roles have been going to James Corden for some reason and i can't stand that guy!

Edit: spelling Honestly it also felt off to me that this one gig was treated like his one and only chance at a  “standard rich and famous contract” rather than just a right now opportunity, glad they sort of called that out with the “same thing tomorrow night” convo after. They said it in Incredibles 2 Quiet Coyote! It did have a small thing at the end My wife and I just hugged and cried. And agreed that, it's all just so beautiful, even if you can't see it at the moment. On a second watch there's a lonely moment in his gallery scene of him sitting alone eating pie, seems very sad; but during the remembering scene at the piano we see how much he enjoyed that bite of pie. Beautiful. That scene where Joe lays out the items is probably my scene of the year. The music, the imagery, the message... it’s all just perfect. That scene felt like therapy to me. That scene reminded me a lot of what I loved about the movie Boyhood. I love the celebration of all of life's little ""insignificant"" moments. It really is beautiful. I loved that moment even more when you remember the scene earlier in the movie with the memory museum. It was a lot of the same moments presented without feeling or context. But he remembers them for himself it has so much power. Yep. Using those items as his “sheet music” was incredibly powerful. That scene was absolutely breathtaking. All the emotions just came at once and it was wonderful My brother said ""That sounds really bad."" It was pretty jarring until you realize it's a middle school class. My mom was so confused and wondered why it sounded so bad. I already knew that Joe was teaching middle school band, so it just clicked immediately and I couldn’t help but laugh. Someone who spent that much time considering the meaning of life, etc has to be the next Dalai Lama or something Nice, quiet Nepal. I was thinking the same thing, it would definitely be quite a shock going from New York to a rural village in Tibet I think this makes sense. She is probably going to become a monk or something considering how she appreciates every moment I think getting to wake up every day staring at the Himalayas would be perfect for 22 I loved the message in the barbershop scene too. Even if you don’t end up where your passion intended, you can still find happiness and fulfillment somewhere else. I really needed to hear that in my 20’s when my original life goals didn’t go as planned I loved the barbershop scene. It kind of showed Joe that his focus on music kept him from getting closer to others. He never knew the barber until 22 gave the barber space to talk about something else. This was actually a big artistic breakthrough Andrew Stanton wanted to use for Wall-E, and he talks in some special features about how they were one of the first on that movie to deliberately make the camera animate as if it were a real camera and not a computer scene camera. I think now they even use motion capture to animate the cameras as if a real camera operator were holding it in a 3D scene. Yeah, it's been around for a long time. Very prominent in Wall-E and some of Pixar's newer stuff but there are shots going back to Monsters inc that simulate that hand-held feel. 2020 hit that guy different >shouldn't that cat be dead because it was seen he was going into the great beyond? 

Nine lives, man. Nine lives. Regarding the cat: Maybe one of the Jerrys were able to intercept it while it was on the escalator. Or it's just a visual gag which we mustn't overthink. 

Really liked the ending. I'm glad that they didn't go with the cliché of showing 22 becoming a newborn and getting physical form. And every hedge fund manager Jon Batiste's jazzing killed it, as it always does.


(His live album at the Village Vanguard is so damn good, especially the Very Thought of You with Rachael Price.) [Just Us](https://youtu.be/KtcPriBV65U) is amazing.  They should get an Oscar nomination for this alone. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross really know how to underline the tone. Seriously blown away. Could honestly meditate to some of the music in this film. 

Also anyone else get Dragon with the Tattoo vibes from Terry’s theme? My kids absolutely loved it. But we lost someone close to us this year, so they’ve kind of been obsessed with life and death the last six months and bring it up all the time. I think it was great for them. Just watched it with my kids. They didn't like it. They love all things Pixar. I think this one was just too heavy. Adults will love it though. I think this will be one of those movies that they'll understand as a kid, but it won't truly resonate until they're older. The quick cut to the cat's soul sitting on the escalator to the Great Beyond was what got me rolling. When they’re both in the elevator and 22-as-Joe takes off his glasses and causes the glare, Joe-as-cat immediately reaches for it. That part killed me but it was super quick. To be fair it’s possible to pay for a cab and get into your apartment using your phone, which we know he had on him. If we’re talking realism here, he could have paid with his phone (which we know he had at the time) using Curb or Arro. When he was playing the show I thought he would go into the zone and 22 would try fuck him up or something lol The movie should’ve been more of this! Those scenes where he gets lost in the music were magical. I think it's a great point about managing expectations about life. 

People have the capacity to really build things up in our minds, and when we actually achieve whatever we build up, it isn't as amazing as we thought in our heads. The best way to avoid this is to live in the moment, which is the message of the film. Don't wait for one thing, enjoy everything, enjoy the world around you all the time. Sure, some moments are greater than others, but life itself is pretty magical. Bless her 😅 Lol my mom said “what is happening? Is he doing all of that right now?.” I had to explain they were memories 😂 I just want to say that I felt the same way, you've truly put into words what I have been feeling for the past hour.  


Just finished watching it and my eyes still burn from crying so much, in a good way of course. As an artist also I get this so much. I was talking to my girlfriend after an exhibition and was explaining how it didn't feel...complete, like I didn't have that feeling of achievement that I thought I would have.  I just felt really empty. I even sold a painting today and it just feels like nothing. My theory is 22 is named that since is the age most people get out of college, and often feel the most lost and unsure of their future, I know I felt that way and is a common feeling post graduation. I might be reaching though lol As a Cubs fan, I’m glad we’re not that joke anymore Well said. I know it’s wasted energy to compare myself to people my age but fuck. It is *hard* This comment hit hard. I've been going through the exact same thing.

Seeing him finish his first gig and not feel as good as he thought was an incredible moment for me. One of my new goals is buying a house and it has borderline become an obsession and a 'cure' to my feelings of inadequacy and being behind in life.

I have been focused solely on the goal of getting a mortgage and genuinely believing at that point I'll be immediately happy and that all my problems will be solved. But that's not what happened in Soul. And that's not what will happen when I finally buy a flat. There will be a happy moment, yes, but then very quickly the rest of life will seep through and I will realise that the destination isn't all it's cracked up to be. And if I don't change something, I will forever be chasing a dream which will ultimately never manifest in full. 

It's made me realise that external factors and physical *things* are never going to make me truly happy, you need more than that. Sure, buying a house is a great goal to have and I won't let go of that, but it shouldn't be the defining feature of my success and the measure of my worth. My ultimate goal should not necessarily be to enjoy every day, but instead to try to enjoy the little moments that make life so wonderful. It's made me realise that I have to do so much more than just find worth through the value of my job or my eventual property. I have to find value in myself and the little moments of joy that I forget to relish in every single day.

The amazing thing is, I am finding myself appreciating the little victories and the simple things in life a lot more today. I haven't lost my passion to go out and push myself forward, but Soul reminded me just to do it a little slower, and enjoy the magical ride we call life. While Pixar movies have always been great, I feel like the recent ones have been reaching to tell stories and lessons on a deeper level. 

Coco, Inside Out, and Soul have all prompted deep topics and long discussions (enjoyable!) from my family about life I was about to agree with you then I thought about all the incredible movies Pixar has made...

Probably still at least top 5 though My main thought, too. It was so beautiful and the music was so good I hated watching it on my TV. Rachel House is awesome! Her Terry character reminded me a lot of her character in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. There's also the throwaway line ""It would be hard enough for me to catch a cab even it I wasn't in a hospital gown"" which said a lot by not making a point of it. Like, his race affects his experience of life in small but significant ways, constantly. Have you checked out the extras? ""Not Your Average Joe"" talks about their work with cultural consultants--only 10 min, but really interesting. Not even Joe just the general bystanders and cast of NYCers walking around. It was diverse and reflects NYC as a city. I'm a black guy and I like seeing both. I like movies like this and Spiderverse that can accurately hit the beats of being black without focusing solely on that and I like If Beale Street Could Talk and other hard hitting examinations as well.

I think we can be collectively intelligent enough as an audience for both types to exist and to enjoy both. Nuance and variety is good in our art. They really, really pulled it off. The barbershop was fantastically realized, the jazz line from Joe's dad, the ""gimme a kiss"" thing, the barber explicitly mentioning Charles Drew's contribution to science (his discovery of plasma enabled blood transfusions), the cab line. It's all subtle but it's all there and I got a little choked up every time. This is the kind of representation we seem to be transitioning to and I fucking love it. Yeah, one of the movie's central theme was that you don't have one singular purpose, and if you think you do, like Joe does with jazz, you run the risk of burning yourself out, becoming obsessive, or feeling empty when you finally do something that you feel like should've fulfilled you. Joe might be good at mentoring, but to showcase it as his ""true calling"" or whatever would go against what the movie tries to explain.

It's a called a spark, not a purpose, for a reason. A spark is the push that inspires. The rest is just living life. >Joe should have stayed a Mentor or gone back to teaching, as that was his true purpose: I thought the movie would go this direction and I’m glad it didn’t. As the higher dimensional beings explain, there is no singular purpose of life for anyone — that’s

IMo the critque isn't that joe's purpose was teaching, it's that by teaching he is still doing something fulfilling even if he's not following his dreams. I thought they would go that route because of the drummer and colleen who are following their own love for music because of him. Also the whole barber thing was more evidence this was going to happen. Again, not saying teaching was his purpose. That Knicks dig is the only thing making 2020 worth it. Although wouldn't it have been hilarious if the Knicks somehow won this year I really like your first point. I thought it was heading towards him staying dead, but having him live makes more sense for a kid’s movie and it works with the theme. I’m a stranger on the internet, but I’m personally glad you’re still with us and I’m glad this movie helped you feel something. Your comment was beautifully written :) It’s incredible to think here you are leaving evidence of what a beautiful person you are, so soon after your hardest moment. Thank you for letting me get to know this small part of you and becoming part of my life in this simple way. I am so glad that you’re here being yourself. I’m so glad I get to be in a world that you’re part of. Don’t worry it was just 1 of his 9 lives > trying to be happy while I see everyone’s achievements of marriages and kids and trying to pursue your one passion

I bet more people are like Joe than you realize, finally achieving what they think is the puzzle piece that will complete them, only to be faced with the question ""what's next?"" They cut to the cat on the road to the great beyond so suddenly, and so briefly, I could not help but crack up laughing at that. I’m truly glad the kitty got to come back though, lol. Soul, Up, Coco, Finding Nemo... this kind of checks out He kind of gets overshadowed by his fellow Pixar founders, but now that he’s the last one standing and appointed head of Pixar, he can truly start getting his name out there. Up and Inside Out are probably in the top 3 with OG toy story as the best Pixar movies IMO, and Soul is pretty close >The animation detail is becoming so good that you can’t tell it’s a Pixar film if you remove the characters with their caricature proportions. Otherwise stills could pass as photos.

You are so right. In the scenes that Terry hides in different places I was like ""Did they turn it into live action suddenly?"". kids in slums are some of the happiest people I've met. They enjoy and appreciate the little things in life. The pressure and constant comparison of kids in this social media age is toxic and addictive. Kids are miserable because of and without their devices. Having seen all the trailers beforehand, I was impressed by how much they were able to hide. So many key scenes were not present, and those that were got taken way out of context. Brilliant guess Off the top of my head: didn’t they not know who he is? I remember them trying to get contact information from him. Also Coco was playing in the class and the feelings from Inside Out appear when 22 tastes pizza for the first time. I also felt the same way at first but after realizing that Joe has finally accepted living life day to day and still finds a way to enjoy the little things, that's when it all made sense to me. It isn't about accomplishing the things you want in life, it's about simply living in the moment and understanding that all of it's up's and downs are what makes being on this planet that much special. I hope you're in a better state of mind and realize it isn't over to enjoy our lives until our time has come.  :) I watched it with my four kids, ages 7-11, and all of them were bored. also cats have 9 lives so it might be a small play on that haha Well that's not what it was. They make the point that the spark was not a passion, but the act of simply being ready to live and enjoy the life in front of you was. It was all about making the most of the journey of life, and not feeling unfulfilled that you've not reached a specific goal.

Although there was an underlying theme of teaching others being Joe's true calling... It was also his primary role when we first see him unfulfilled. Similarly, when he did his gig, he felt similar emptiness because he expected a sustained emotional payload from reaching the destination. These two feelings of disappointment show it wasn't about a specific role or passion.

So if the film just came to the resolution that teaching was Joe's singular passion all along, that would have been a bit cliché and would've left some things unexplained.

The direction they took instead delivered far more emotion and originality than ""Oh, his spark was teaching."" I played in a brass band as a kid, and I could smell valve oil from looking at those instruments. Beautiful. and you could even see the sweat on Dorothea's quartet as they progressed through their set in the jazz montage Yeah, it made me cry like a baby. I’m so happy 22 finally found a purpose to live. Well 1-21 seemed okay with it Imagine what the “hall of everything” looked like.


Just some berries, rocks, and dying from bacterial infections. The hall of everything was a few lions and a lot of walking around. He was 100% well within his right so says me and all of r/nba Must be a Mets fan too.  Put a couple Mets things on the wall of the barber shop and Joe was wearing an 80s style Mets jersey in his flashback montage. True. No one can dispute the premise of the joke. I’m from Washington, DC but am beginning to move to the mountains of North Carolina. Seeing the hustle and bustle of NYC makes me just want to not. I miss it so much. I'm about 51% sure she's the next incarnation of the Dalai Lama. My dad mentioned why he couldn’t do both, and I’m hoping Joe figures that out! The student was mainly encouraged by 22, not Joe, when she was about to give up Yeah, I was really worried they were going to have him chase after a woman in the end, but I'm happy they only hinted at her through 22. Having a relationship be the reason you want to keep on living would be a *horrible* message. Absolutely. Teasing the love interest but having him see the joy in his simple pie be the payoff of the ""loner at a diner"" setup was beautiful. Ferris Bueller (quoting Allen Saunders) says it well: ""life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans."" I think this year we all were forced to stop making plans and see our lives for what they really are, and this movie's theme put a spotlight on that at exactly the right time. Pedro pascal: Do you WISH it? 😂😂 THAT'S WHAT IT WAS REMINDING ME OF THE ENTIRE TIME My favorite bits aside from the city was when they were in the club playing and the atmosphere was just top of the line, honestly. The haze in the room, the shadows, the sweat on their foreheads during the show. Outstanding. I agree, there’s something about cities, NYC especially, that I just love when they’re done well. Watching all the hard work of animating and directing the city in this movie had me as transfixed as 22. At first I was really unhappy to see it set in NYC since I'm here every day. Then at the end the Silver cup logo/billboard made an appearance and it's one of the many little things in this city that make me smile. That's what got the tears going for me. I tell anyone who will listen... This series is an absolute must read, especially for anyone suffering with depression. The most important part of the First Oath, I feel. Bridge 4! No one can have my pain but me. You will be warm again Very immature i agree i dont even know where the “leaving the dreams to the pros” came from at all. But i will say kids might be a bit confused by the message, kind of a tough one for them to wrap their head around so will be interested how they take it. Still i think its a super important message a lot of us wish we understood earlier so im really happy the film exists and might reach some kids I honestly think Pixar’s roll of “passions are great. but sometimes what you love and living are different. Sometimes you might not just be good enough at what you want to do and *thats okay*” should be aggressively in more kids media. They’ve had that be the lesson in a few movies now.

I think the “if you work hard you can do anything you set your mind towards” and “if you do what you love you’ll never work a day” screwed up a lot of my generation. Lol what a hilariously shitty take that is, the main character literally becomes a pro during the movie, so how the hell could they think that it's saying to leave the dreaming to the pros?  
It says that even the pros aren't satisfied by just mindlessly chasing their dreams!  
That hedge fund dude was the very definition of a pro, and he wasn't exactly a role model.  

I know subjectivity is a major part of art and all, but some interpretations are just objectively wrong and this is one of them.

>way for the professional movie viewer to miss the point.

Yeah well that's kind of the lesson from the movie right? Being a professional is not the end all be all, if you're just mindlessly chasing a singular goal instead of enjoying things as they come to you then you're missing out on what life is all about, I feel like a lot of reviewers actually fall into this trap, they get so hyperfocused on the technical aspects of what they think makes for a good movie that they can never just have some plain fun. I watched this with my friend and her boyfriend and her boyfriend hated it for the same reason. He didn't think ""just live"" was a good enough message and instead felt that it was actively discouraging children from being ambitious or responsible. 

I disagree but hey, that's life. People approach art from different perspectives. The Knicks cameo was perfect. It was either going to be a lolMets or a Knicks joke and as soon as I saw the basketball player, I knew it was going to be a good one.

And they even got Doris Burke to do the voice-over Ratatouille 2: Rona Edition. Just a wave returning back to the ocean. 

Could have still done without the bug-zap sound though. Yeah I thought that that was a really good portrayal of how you can get stuck in a negative spiral by being being overly down on yourself, by amplifying your flaws and mistakes and amplifying any criticisms that you receive. Big time. And the whole idea that the voices weren't her own. It was Joe's and all the other mentors who put her down because *they* were frustrated. It had nothing to do with her, they were just projecting their issues and she absorbed them, and took it on herself. Sounds real familiar! And also that the negative representation of Joe was much larger and physically closer to 22, he stood over her while the other apparitions were in the background. His cruel words hurt her more because she cared most for his approval/affirmation. He was someone who she held in high esteem. They had a real parent/child connection - in that way, a cruel word from a beloved parent would hurt more than anyone else I think it is a reminder for parents: a child's heart is fragile, and therefore we should be careful about what we say. Things that are said in the heat of the moment can make or break a child. I really thought that scene with the items and piano playing was already the peak emotional moment of the movie. But then that scene with 22 and her inner demons was just so heart breaking and unexpected that I was just bawling Indeed.  It was a very apt visualization of self-criticism.  While good in moderate amounts, it can easily drag people down past inaction into downright despair.

If anything, it reminded me of Riley and their take on depression in the film Inside Out - the controls going grey, the islands dissolving and Riley herself losing her color palette as the depression ate at her. I also feel like when Joe says ""H-E-Double Hockey Sticks"" and the kids start chanting ""hell"" is also a bit of a reference.   


Kids take in more than we think. Maybe they don't get everything, but when they pay attention they can pick up a lot. This was such a funny joke to me but I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere else. Just the deadpan ""I'm 12"" killed me The 4 year old is just reaching the end of the psychedelic phase of childhood, where they’re basically riding the zone pirate ship all the time. I’m 23 and even though I liked this movie, it scared me in an existentialism kind of way >He was really uncomfortable with the escalator to the afterlife bit.

Relatable. I liked the movie's message, but I don't think I can rewatch it because it's so existentialist. My girlfriend and I had to pause the movie and talk about how terrifying their depiction of the great beyond was. It was an all consuming void of white that blipped people out it was so scary To be fair jazz can be hard for adults. Those are wonderful reactions from both ends of the spectrum - I love it! Your kids sound super thoughtful 22 would be a terrifying genius of a baby ""I'll never stop chasing you. I'm relentless, like The Terminator."" No soul left behind. Thet Joe Gahdnah’s one bed igg. Come on, they gave him a trophy! (which he requested) 

What more could you ask for? (other than it not being immediately rescinded) As an accountant, I cannot tell you how accurate that is. They were an antagonist without being villainous.

They worked against the protagonist, but only because they were trying to correct an error in the system. I love that there was no actual convincing of him or change of his heart. Just a stupid distraction.

He honestly gave me Dwight vibes. FOUR I MEAN FIVE I MEAN FIRE That guy is gonna be seriously fucked up for life lmao Makes sense they'd model human movements on someone famous for is ability to Stay Human. As well, on the name tag wall, one of the few names that you can *very* clearly see is Joe Ranft, a longtime Pixar animator and voice actor who passed away at the age of 45. I felt that way when Terry came to earth. I legitimately forgot for a moment that the entire movie was animated. The quality of 3D animation that Soul demonstrated is truly astounding. Watching in 4K was such a treat. When the accountant enters the “real” world it’s difficult to comprehend that the “real” world is also animated. NYC will be back some day. They can’t kill the city that never sleeps I was temporarily working and living in NYC and was going to move there officially until COVID hit.  The part that really hit me HARD during this movie was Joe in the subway staring off into the sunset at Queensboro plaza (during that montage towards the end).  It felt so real and made me miss the city so much! Knicks fans: *you took everything from me*

22 as a baby: *I don't even know who you are* gen xers too >I really really liked that message though, and I think the whole quest to find a greater purpose has left far too many millennials and zoomers completely lost.

Oh yes. It all starts with the question of ""what do you want to be when you grow up"". And every manager wants to hear how your work is your great passion just to get hired. I cried in front of my kids and they started whispering to themselves and kind of laughed like ""why you crying daddy"" 


Its a cool movie and a great time to show our kids that its ok to cry Feel better, man. Things will get better. didn't know he was in the movie going in, then recognised his voice immediately. The barber was one of my favorite characters in the movie tbh. Yep. You're not assigned a purpose in life, you have to see what your purpose is. He even said after his mother was done sewing his suit that it felt like jazz. I think what hit hard for me was when the mom was explaining about paying bills, but wasn't said was the moral and loving support of a significant other. When Joe arrived home after his dream gig, to his empty apartment in the dark, it was such a stark contrast. Joe put off life, love, and a possible family to live his dreams. If he stayed on this route, this obsession, he would've became a lost soul. In a similar vein, that hedge fund manager bit was hilarious. Though I wonder if hedge fund managers in real life thought it was funny too. Yeah that was one of my favorite little details of the movie, you could totally bum yourself out and become totally depressed by focusing on how alone you are and how you don't have a girlfriend or whatever to share your meals with, or you could just live in the moment and enjoy a tasty meal!  
It's all just a matter of what you choose to focus on, I love that he didn't get a girlfriend or anything at the end of the movie, because that isn't neccesary, it's not about the end goal or about checking any boxes it's about enjoying whatever comes your way, journey before destination. The part where Joe saves 22 has to be one of the best metaphors about anxiety ever made. Honestly right up there with Stupid Piece of Shit from Bojack and the Anxiquitos from this most recent season of Big Mouth. I was watching it with my two nieces talking over it etc., and even with that distraction their depiction hit me *hard* As a jazz musician myself I totally agree, the whole concept of being “in the zone” literally transporting your soul to another world makes perfect sense to me, and this whole movie was such a love letter to jazz or any craft while also having deep messages about life One of the many things the film has going for it is that no one is really in the wrong To be fair she landed in like China or so. It'd probably take that long! Watching that on my 4K TV was stunning. Just deep blacks peppered with bright dots of white leading to a big HDR blowout of white. Such a beautifully animated sequence. Agreed. Pixar really knows how to hit the feels. Richard Ayoade was the best Jerry for me. I hate James Corden so much. So happy Graham got this part! ""James, I've got a great role for you.""

""Does the film include a cat's butthole?""

""...kinda."" That's less of calling it out and more the simplified takeaway of the film. This is Joe's perception of the show, not the reality of it.  He misunderstood this as being his moment, his breakout, his aligning with the master purpose behind his life rather than an opportunity to live and experience his life and feed his passions while doing so. And even earlier, in Cars, Lightning says “I’m in hillbilly Hell” Right, they said crap in both I2 and Soul too!

I was wondering when they got permission to say that. >there's a lonely moment in his gallery scene of him sitting alone eating pie, seems very sad; but during the remembering scene at the piano we see how much he enjoyed that bite of pie. Beautiful.

I loved that they called back to that scene. He realizes just because he was alone at that moment doesn’t mean he wasn’t happy. To be exact, he remembered again how much he enjoyed that piece of pie. His life had so many beautiful moments big and small, that he hadn't really thought about up to that point. Agreed I was tearing up at that scene My mom was literally like “that sounds like a grade school band practice!” (she has a habit of accidentally predicting the next thing that’s gonna happen in a movie lol) This is my new headcanon. Especially with her being mentored by some of history's most influential people. [deleted] ***2319, WE GOT A-*** WELCOME TO THE HIMALAYAS! Anyone want a snow cone? She wouldn’t remember New York anyway I loved the barbershop scene too, but for another reason. For the first time, Joe didn't talk about himself, but listened to the barber. Turns out, he had an interesting story and helped in creating a meaningful bond.

Life is not just about ourselves, but also about sharing it with people. 

I'm currently reading this book ""How to win friends and influence people"" by Dale Carnegie, and this is what the first chapter is about. Amen. Also, Terry would've made sure that cat survived. They know that soul wasn't meant to depart that day. I love the idea of cats (and dogs) join us to the Great Beyond. :) I think Pixar realized this and put in that joke early on.

""Connie knows what I mean, right Connie?""

""I'm 12"" Haha that was hilarious, poor cat just meowing in confusion Also when he begins to instinctively clean himself and then realizes he just licked his crotch and freaks out Up, Inside Out, and Soul are all written and directed by Pete Docter. 

I think this man wants the world to learn some philosophical truths. Even Onward dealt with the usually heavy topic of losing a father as a child, the trauma of being able to say goodbye, or even never having met your father at all. You're right it's probably recency bias but I think it would def fall in the top 5 for me Yeah, but I'm just glad we were able to watch the movie at all. Disney should rerelease some of these movies in theaters if they have the chance in the future. Damn I didn’t even catch that. I just thought of that as a normal NYC thing, either because the cab you’re trying to hail is taken by someone just ahead of you or because the cab doesn’t want to drive to the outer boroughs. Both instances have happened many times to me and although the latter is illegal and should be called into 311, I tend to just quickly cuss out the cabby and move on with my life lolll I'm Black and instantly knew what he meant. Lol got a good chuckle outta me. I am digging the call backs to eastern philosophy and spirituality so much. It’s all about the moment, and appreciating it without getting attached, which will cause you too suffer more in the end due to missing what is gone or wishing for something more. [deleted] Absolutely. Honestly I am pretty happy with my life, but being single and especially living in a shitty town you hate sucks, but wild all my problems go away with a girlfriend or if I moved to Chicago? Absolutely not Wall-e has nearly all of humanity dying off so I guess that super counts  John Lasseter used to get the lions share of the acclaim but now I think Brad Bird is the one people always hold up in high regard. Same, but as they said in the movie, your spark isn’t your purpose :) Hunter-gatherer societies were actually fairly egalitarian and easy going, I'd rather have that than be a medieval serf or farmhand. 

Plus, coming from an indigenous background, there's still sunlight in the trees and waves over your toes thousands of years ago, too. The earth has always been beautiful and good, just as it is.

There's also singing, hunting, weaving, whittling, beading, dancing, playing, story telling, etc. etc. Being human has always carried with it many creative possibilities as well as hardships. 

Modern medicine is the best, but hunter-gatherer-ing isn't some hell of rigorous work and scarcity it seems to be made out to be. I think it's probably successful hunting, good sleep, fresh meat, sex and also berries. MEAT.

MAKE FUCK.

KILL.

_spark fills in_ *wow! My spark is 'Not touching the tiger!'* That makes sense considering that 22 was heading straight for the area around Tibet, Nepal and the Himilayas. Yeah! He might not get a pension, but he seems to already give private music lessons if he wants to keep teaching while still performing. 

Maybe with him in the Quartet, they get more gigs and get better album sales or something and he won't need a pension.

Maybe he can become a music Youtuber... maybe he can get a position teaching at a conservatory or college or other tertiary level place rather than a middle school. He's got the teaching chops and the association will likely become respected as a performing musician in his own right with Dorothea.

Or he could still teach kids if he misses teaching them. The job was apparently doable part time, maybe the full time schedule isn't actually going go interfere with his music gigs. A part timer or assistant can  sub when he goes on tour or something.

Joe has a lot of possibilities going for him (and I guess the less we're all supposed to learn is so do we all.) Yes, but Connie didn't know that. She went to Joe because she thought of Joe not just because it's class time to do it, but because she probably figured Joe not only wouldn't let her quit, she wouldn't want to.

I think part of that whole thing was that all Joe really needed to do was be there for Connie to convince herself. Because Joe already represented something to Connie, he was ""love of making music"" to Connie. He didn't need to encourage Connie any more than he already had. That's the whole ""Maybe you can be someone else's spark"" thing. 

But I understand what you mean. It was 22 in that body. But Connie valued Joe because Joe was in that body the previous times Connie needed someone to encourage her to accept how much she loved trombone. Joe in the cat knew she wasn't quitting, he knew all ""Joe"" needed to do was sit there and let Connie talk herself out of it.

A mentor isn't just someone who tells you what to do and how to do it, is it? Yeah exactly, being focused on having a relationship instead of being alone would be just another example of an overly goal-focused approach to life, it would be just another type of unhealthy obsession.  

Relationships are great of course, but they shouldn't be your reason for living, you should never have a singular reason for living, you should learn to find joy whether you're alone or not. What series is this from? I only have 200 pages left in RoW, and took a break to watch Soul. My emotions are having a really busy day. I think if you watch this movie once a year, kids will get more and more insight about themselves. Like from elementary school -> middle school -> high school, you start thinking about ""purpose"" and this movie really gives you some perspective that even us adults are still clueless. Thats why I actually really really love Monsters University. I thought it had a similar message, with it being ""college isnt for everyone but you can still do what you like and succeed"".

I'm really glad Pixar is doing these messages that aren't as common in children's media Yeah, I agree. The movie even critiques these stuff.

Not a sob story or anything, but I notice these looks of condescension when someone with big DREAMS and PASSION gives me. The question was what do you want? I said money. That person of course knew that they couldn't really say something negative about that. But I know what that look was, and I see it in in others too. I would have achieved so much more if I wasn't so overambitious. It's a fast track to mental illness. Actually losing my mind at the idea of a restaurant being shut down because of COVID and not because it employs rats Heh, I thought it was funny. Dark, but funny. Initially when I made it, there was more of a splat, the audio always cracked me up I also like how it contrasts with the flashback moments with all her previous mentors. They’re all moments of comedy when in truth, they were moments of real pain for 22. Much like how we too may often try to pass off the most hurtful things said to us as jokes—even to the point of trying to tell ourselves that they were just jokes too. Yeah she probably still has vague memories of the great before I'm 27 and this movie really hit me in a positive way.

As someone who has started their career and felt feelings of disappointment that it's not making me suddenly feel complete like I thought it would, I loved the message about how we don't have innate callings, and that living itself is the spark of life.

I know people who have really struggled with fitting what they perceived as their calling into a career.

It's an important lesson to learn, and almost everyone has to learn it. We all have interests but at the end of the day, it's the sum of our experiences that makes a fulfilling existence, not just the relentless pursuit of one thing. “I said it first, you're more like Sarah Connor, and in the first movie too, before she could do chinups.” No choild leihft behoind, No choild leihft behoind. Fuck now I need to watch Hunt for the Wilderpeople again Yup, I’m in accounting and the second I tell anyone they tune out. Tbh nothing ever eventful happens. I liked how the latest Pixar films haven't had antagonists that aren't truly evil or villainous like Gabby Gabby and Terry. Very interesting nonetheless. I wanted to hate Terry but damn they were just doing their job Terry was voiced by Rachel House I believe? So maybe it’s implied that Terry was not male nor female? Just a cosmic entity voiced by a female. Like how the rest are all Jerrys? Which is also an androgynous name? Judging by his prior attitude, he kind of needed to be shook Only reference I caught by naked eye was Jack Kirby, will have to pause and look for more. I hope so! NYC has been here since before there was a USA and it will continue to be there long after it's gone, short of human extinction or direct meteor hit nothing will kill that city Yes! The Manhattan-bound 7 going towards the Sivercup sign (is that the part you’re referring to?). I live in Queens and used to take the 7 every day. I didn’t recognize Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, or Graham Norton, but I recognized Moss immediately. Same. I want to see him in more prominent roles. I loved when he's like, ""why did we never talked about this"" and the barber is like ""you never asked"" 

reminds me a lot, like, there's articles that say that [guys had suffered a lot during covid coz they don't know how to make friends](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/coronavirus-loneliness-friendship-men-b1764535.html). And how really the posibilities were always there but for some reason or another we didn't/don't take advantage of them. I took the message more as: We shouldn't focus on finding a purpose. Its not about ""seeing what your purpose is"", it's about living a fullfilling life no matter what you do. It was also interesting take on how your ""passion"", aka the thing that gets you excited and ""in the zone"", can also corrupt and suck all the joy out of the rest of your life if you let it. Also, how accurate is it that coming out of the zone messes you up sometimes?! That’s how it always happens for me. This is something that always makes a film better for me: different perspectives rather than outright villains, makes everything much more thought-provoking and multi-dimensional.*

*Although some films absolutely need a cartoonish villain, of course! It’s nice to see a film with no villains. Disney must have the best quality in streaming. Any other service would have distorted those bridge scenes, or maybe I was just lucky with my internet tonight It’s also said in Ratatouille. Like the first thing after being hired said to Linguini is “welcome to hell.” now watch china ban the movie Or anything that happened in all the time she spent in the pre-life up to and including meeting Joe. Which begs the question why exactly the new souls need mentoring ...and that was good development for Joe.  The man was so obsessed with his one passion that he ignored everything.

Heck!  Joe kind of reminded me of Miles Teller’s character from Whiplash, though Joe ultimately had the realization that there was more to life than jazz.

Teller’s character, if he was in this film, would’ve probably ended up being a lost soul since being a drummer is all he cared about as he abandoned the other parts of his life for that goal. Well i'll be damned. What was simply a funny scene, turned out wholesome. ""I'm so angry I'm going to claw the couch...wait it's MY couch..."" It's inspiring. I'm an animator and want to direct one day, but I REALLY want to tell stories that have philosophical weight. It makes me so happy that Pete Docter is out here making mainstream animated films like that. Loved that. It added even more depth to the meaning. The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson.

Essentially how I made it through 2020. It’s incredible. The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson I can't imagine taking a break in the middle of the ""Sanderlanche"". I'm on chapter 38 of my re-read, audiobook this time.

Although, Soul is worth it. I watched it a second time tonight. The way the movie described the lost souls as those obsessed with the “zone” definitely hit close to that Then some of us just feel like Joe where... None of it really fell into place and you haven't really succeeded at anything. This movie went, ""Dear losers, we see you. You are not a waste of space."" That was incredible to me. ""GIVE ME YOUR GUN""
""What?! I'm not going to do that!"" And Officer Bronco in Onward This voice is metaphorical... I just chose this voice to be annoying. It outright says early in the film that they simply choose to have human like forms to make the metaphor easier to understand. Johnny Cash caught my eye immediately It's message regarding that reminded me a lot of Infinite Jest, which is partly about how blurry the distinction is between passion and addiction. It kinda reminded me of a discussion I've seen recently on gaming. I can't remember what YouTube video I was watching, but the guy basically asked the viewer, ""why do you play the games you play? What makes you do what you do?"" The question was called for because games like to give you busy work just to keep you playing. If you're into WoW, do you still enjoy it? Or do you just log on to do your dailies? Do you still enjoy league of legends? Or do you play it because you want to get a higher rank?

I started asking myself these questions when I watched the video and then I realized I don't like the games I play anymore. I just play them because it's just, what I ""do."" Realizing it, I took a break. It's been a nice few days so far. This movie had great antagonists but no villains. Just like Inside Out, our biggest adversaries is just ourselves The memories of the soul definitely don’t transfer over at birth, but it’s pretty clear that personalities and general interests transfer over. The entire point of the mentoring is to develop those in new souls Isn’t the fish in the ocean anecdote that Dorothea tells Joe a David Foster Wallace reference too? I thought that was a nice touch. Even Terry was just doing their job. Specifically, to give them a spark, which is basically just a desire to be alive.

It is almost like how machine learning would approach training artificial life. Just let a bunch of programs run around learning stuff until it feels like it wants to live. Reminds me of Roy Batty's ""Tears in the Rain"" monologue from Blade Runner. The moments we experience are what makes us truly alive. ",0
25,"Okay but heart fucking broke when I saw Bruno’s table setting. That has to be the most quietly heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen in a Disney movie. ""We Don't Talk About Bruno."" Proceeds to have the best musical number in the film about Bruno. So the cousin can't keep a secret for 5min at dinner but has been hearing Bruno in the walls for how many years and never bothered to mention it..? mirabel’s gift being bringing her family to reality was such a great peaceful resolution, but i really wish we saw what kind of room casita built for her! after all that work repairing generational trauma she deserves all
the sewing machines and skeins of yarn she wants. I just want to mention the yellow butterflies. They are an iconic piece of One Hundred Years of Solitude that have become a symbol for Colombia and magical realism, meaning the occurrence of life and joy in the middle of grim circumstances. I had a big smile when one of them showed up in the river by the end of the movie, it was kind of the same story told once again.

But the first time we saw a yellow butterfly was when they show Mariano in love with Isabela, resembling Mauricio Babilonia’s character in the book, who was always followed by yellow butterflies when in love.

Edit: my first award! Thank u! They really, really captured Colombia. Down to the father saying ""miercoles"" as a euphemism. The entire time the family was singing “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,"" all I could think of was, “Silenzio, Bruno!” Crossover universe between Luca and Encanto confirmed. I haven't seen it posted already so I'll just comment this: Mirabel's skirt/dress is beautifully animated, and it really popped to me during The Family Madrigal. Can't wait to see this again, probably in 3D this time. I loved this movie. Surface Pressure was definitely my favorite song. Bawled like a bitch throughout the movie. I was happy that there was no real villan. Its true the grandma was a huge fuckin asshole, but I wouldnt classify her as a villain. Just a dick. And once she had her eyes opened to how her dick behavior had negatively impacted her family, she changed. I do wish she had a more over time transition though. Kinda seems like she just got slapped in the face with the consequences of her actions and then was like ""oh shit what have I done"" and that was that. Otherwise, I had a great time seeing it and Ill prolly get it on dvd when its out So, I don't know if I'm crazy here, but everything on the internet is stating that there is ""no physical antagonist"" in this movie and that the antagonist is more thematic in terms of ""generational trauma"" but....Abuela Alma is like, ABSOLUTELY the antagonist here right?  Like, just because she learns her lesson doesn't make her behavior less downright toxic to the other members of her family for a healthy chunk of the movie... Just saw it, loved it. Some observations:

- The shape-shifting cousin had chameleons on his poncho. I didn't notice this til the end, but what a nice detail.

- Of course Bruno's visions are glass panes. What is glass made of? Sand.

- Recognized Abuela's voice from In The Heights immediately, which was cool. Didn't realize til afterwards that Mirabel was in the movie version as well.

- All the musical sequences. I'm a slut for musical sequences in animation and these were all incredible. We Don't Talk About Bruno is of course the stand-out one. Can't wait til that's on Youtube to rewatch it and soak in more of the animation details.

- Speaking of Bruno, I did think his character design looked a little young, which was kind of odd? I remember seeing shots of him in one of the trailers a few weeks ago and thinking ""okay, that guy's gotta be our love interest character"". Oops. My family and I have been singing ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" nonstop since last night.

Such an earworm. Question, Mirabel was basically ostracized because she didn’t have a gift and in her Abuela’s eyes could not help their community. But who the hell was Camilo helping with his gift? How can shapeshifting really help anyone? Honestly, I really loved it which is why it's shortcomings were so pronounced to me. The visuals were gorgeous, and the notion of having it set essentially in one house is a concept that I loved. The powers were all very cute and interesting. But the plot pacing was so, so strange. One major instance I can remember was >!the fight between the main character and the grandma!<. I feel like that should have happened halfway through the movie, but it happened like 85% in - it was resolved essentially immediately after. Or how >!the sisters can't stand each other, but after a short song they are completely in sync!<. The begining and end felt so brief, but the middle was really long. Don't get me wrong, it was the best part of the movie, but the pacing was really not doing it for me. I also felt that the music was tired and really unremarkable. The songs didn't push the plot forward much and felt like a desperate attempt to reach the top 10 charts. I know it's to be expected at this point, but it still was upsetting to hear. I can't remember a single song - even if you played it to me, I wouldn't be able to tell you it was in the movie. Bruno is a perfect character Kinda gets easily overlooked but can we appreciate the fact they actually had people of different skin tones in the family instead of easily making everyone white or the same tone. Accurate for Colombia. Did anyone else feel Pepa (aunty tied to the weather) was a subtle representation of mental illness? It seemed she always had clouds and was battling her anxiety throughout. I quite liked that it wasn't made into a big deal - it was (and is) just part of life. I realized something while watching this movie and it’s that I’m not a fan of how Disney animated their musical numbers anymore because of how many cutaways they have to something that doesn’t exist. Old Disney movies used to use songs to broaden the world. For example, One Jump Ahead in Aladdin making the streets of Agrabah come alive, A Girl Worth Fighting For from Mulan showing the Chinese countryside and the citizens that the army was protecting. The Circle of Life is probably the best example of this, showing us just how impressive the lions rule over the pride lands is and setting the stage perfectly for the rest of the movie.

Meanwhile, in modern Disney movies half of the songs don’t even take place in the setting they’re being sung in, characters are transported off to mystical dreamscapes where they fall through clouds and interact with metaphorical representations of what they’re singing about. See: You’re Welcome in Moana, Summer in Frozen, and Surface Pressure in Encanto. I dunno, I feel like it makes the world feel more shallow and thin for a few quick gags Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting is so tied to his singing voice that I honestly couldn't listen to any of the songs in this movie without hearing his voice in the back of my head. What is happening at Disney? All their films recently feel like messes. Full of great ideas, great characters, beautiful imagery - but meandering stories struggling to link these things together. Is the plot an afterthought in development? I’m colombian, this movie was amazing. the fact that the family was displaced by violence is not something id ever see in a disney movie. Colombia has been in one conflict or another for like 100 years and most of the books that come out of Colombia are heavily related to that, is unfortunately, a huge part of what Colombia is. 

Also, i felt that the ashes were a reference to Armero, but that might be a stretch. 

Overall I’m severely pleasantly surprised, this was beyond my expectations and we’ll see it a few more times 


My fav song was dos orugas, tho it felt just so relatable because of my recent breakup. The grandmother scene where she explains her origins was just heartbreakingly beautiful. Not a dry eye in my theater i realized: does abuela have a gift? her central role is to act as the leader of the family without any additional assistance of magic guiding everyone else in her influence. if anything then mirabel wasn’t the first one to not be granted a direct power. she as herself is enough to lead others with love - she takes after her grandmother in this regard. her grandmother puts so much of their family’s success squarely on the magic thinking of herself as  not enough to take care of everyone depending on her without the magic. as much as the movie is about mirabel understanding she is enough the grandmother is enough as well. they are both worthy of the love of others without condition. This… wasn’t a good movie, it was ok at best.  It looked great, but the story and songs were just all off.  Nobody is going to be singing these songs like any of the 90s Disney classics. It's so beautiful to see my country represented like this, specially the Donkeycorn First Luca and now Encanto, Brunos can't catch a break this year. XD This is a far more positive discussion thread than I was expecting for a very mediocre film. I don't know, I'm someone that tends to like most Disney offerings but this one just didn't do it for me at all. The pacing was disjointed, the messaging was troublesome for most of the movie, and most egregiously I just didn't feel very connected to the story at all. I think this could have been a more interesting film if it dived more into the family dynamics and fleshed out characters, but they just slid in like a half dozen musical cues instead that just took you completely out of it. The story was pretty bare and there was barely anything explored before wrapping it up with a neat bow at the end. 

Also, Abuela was 100% the antagonist and a stone cold bitch for like 95% of the movie. What a wholly negative character. Yeah, it's sad that your husband died during your escape 30+ years back, but that shouldn't give you free reign to just treat your granddaughter like shit for most of her life. I felt pretty bad for the main character as it seemed like no one was on her side at all until she found her uncle. And for what, the fact that she didn't have a gift? That's so fucking petty and cruel. She didn't have a choice. Also basically ostracizing her son for literal years and just leaving it as is is super fucked. Everyone is trying to placate this old matriarch who just seems to care about the family image and them being perfect rather than just being a kind person. We got so little warmth from her throughout the entire film. The fact that they tried such a hollow resolution to try and redeem her character with a sad flashback at the end felt so cheap and just bothered me. 

I've got a few smaller nitpicks as well. It's strange that they really hand-waved the acquirement of magical abilities from the start and it kept me from being able to buy in at all. Like why are they so special? Did no one else lose a loved one escaping? Is there a reason why they kept getting blessings for multiple generations? You can't just hop right into a musical recap from the jump. Also, there's a whole ass village of people, looks to be multiple generations, who seem to be completely lost without this family holding their hands and solving their issues. Finally those creepy little kids hopped up on caffeine. I think they were going for cute and hyperactive and referencing coffee from Colombia, but it was more off-putting than anything to me. 

I give this like a 3/10. Maybe the weakest Disney affiliated film I've seen in years. Beautiful animation and I'm all for more representation and exploration of cultures, but man was this one a stinker on multiple fronts. Mediocre story and the grandma is a grade-A cunt. Pressure to succeed can destroy a family, accept your family for who they are. I thought it was great. An immediate ""must buy"".


I also really appreciated how well represented the different skin tones were. I think they've done a good job lately of representing the people that live where these movies take place. Byron Howard and Jared Bush are quickly becoming the new Musker/Clements of Walt Disney Animation Studios IMHO. Byron directed Tangled, both Byron and Bush directed Zootopia, and now they've given us  Encanto. I'll be looking forward to any project where they are at the helm. 

I was a little disappointed by Raya and the Last Dragon, so I had doubts for the next animated Disney flick, but I have to say that I really enjoyed this. 

The songs were very fun and emotional, the humour was on point, the characters were likeable, and the story was well-written. 

I love that Mirabel didn't get a magical power by the end... I feel like a more cliched kids movie would have caved and went with a cheap, overly-happy route for her character. So question if Abuela's cutting words to Mirabel were replaced with Abuela hitting Mirabel each time while the whole family did nothing, would Abuela in the end face zero consequences and maintain her social and power status?

Why is emotional abuse considered a less serious and hurtful form of abuse vs. physical abuse? I’ve been listening to “Surface Pressure” and “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” nonstop since seeing this. “Waiting for a Miracle” is an interesting take on the usual “I want” song.

Amazing visuals as well. They really played around with the lighting a lot and I loved it.

Good story overall, though I’d guess some folks might have issues with how the miracle works/doesn’t work. Bruno even lampshades the weirdness about the Encanto’s rules. It actually reminded me of a traditional fairytale, where things are magical just because they are. Encanto way better than Raya and the Last Dragon. I know the former was not a musical but Encanto just had better characters and the antagonistic character was not let off easily unlike Raya and the Last Dragon. Encanto harkens back to the Disney animation movies that focuses on a singular character instead of the tag-team of the revival era.

If I had to give any negatives, it's that it features Lin-Manuel Miranda's weakest songs to date. Moana has a way more catchier and emotional soundtrack. Overall, I loved Encanto, go watch it because this movie deserves to do well at the box office. I know this is a superfluous question but what time period is the movie set in?

My gut instinct was that it had to be 50 years after La Violencia, because that was one of the biggest civil conflicts in Colombia. The family goes to the mountains during La Violencia, and fifty years later the movie starts.

Only La Violencia was during the 1950s, and that would mean that Encanto is set in the 2000s, and it doesn’t really look like it is? Am I the only person who feels that the pacing of the movie was quite off? The songs felt out of place, there was a lack of natural flow and it felt like character progression was way too quick and shallow. With how Isabela and Mirabel did not like one another and didn't seem close to them perfectly opening up and mending things perfectly in one song. It all seemed a bit choppy to me and the rap style of the songs was not really my favourite, I didn't feel the emotion. “He wants 5 babies”. That was unexpected My theater was full of little Hispanic kids who squealed and cheered when a character spoke or sang in Spanish. When Isabela was introduced, the little girl next to me, maybe 6 or 7, yelled, “That’s MY name!” It made me tear up. This is why representation matters. I just loved how the characters *moved* in this movie.  They've done such a good job and made such incredible progress at animating dancing, posture, gait, and body language.  I want to watch it 2 or 3 times again just to enjoy how they move.

Mirabel's character was so lovable and charismatic.  I loved her style and the choices that they made with her look, demeanor, and personality.

I really enjoyed about half of the songs, while some others were a little muddled or the kind of middle-of-the road, ""this is a musical and it's been a while so I guess we should put a song here"" kind of songs.  Definitely could feel LMM's influence/style.

The story was pretty good.  While I loved the reconciliation between Mirabel and Isabela, it happened too quickly and with almost no real effort of genuine apology, empathy, or introspection.  It simply felt like a red-herring plot device to obfuscate that the real conflict was between Mirabel and her Grandma.

Speaking of, Grandma's redemption was also juuustt a little too easy/convenient.  They could have worked on that a little more where you can see her heart change back to cherishing what she has rather than fearing what is lost.

Louisa was so precious.  Loved her ""here's how I feel inside"" song but again, the pressure and burdens that she has had to bear weren't physical -- they were mental, and that wasn't really resolved in the end.  I guess maybe a little -- she got to sit in a hammock there for a bit?  Ok back to work holding this family and community together (physically)!

I was disappointed that Delores and Camila had very little to add to this movie.  Why didn't Delores hear grandma praying for help to save the family near the beginning of the movie? We knew she could have, considering she can hear Louisa's eye twitch and Mirabel's confession to her dad.  Camila was only a changeling used for physical comedy.  We got to know nothing about, and gained no real rapport with this person in the movie, unfortunately.

Antonio's affinity for Mirabel was fantastic.  You could feel the bond between them and the scene where he reached out to her to help walk him to his door was adorable.

I absolutely hate how they brushed off Bruno's return to good graces.  He's been unjustly outcast for years, patching the house together from the inside, longing for his family, and when he finally gets accepted back into the fold, he is brushed aside after a quick hug from Grandma.   He really deserved more.

At the end, I teared up at the family's acknowledgment of Mirabel as she approached the front door.  I would have liked to see it spelled out just a little more for the kids that she really didn't get a gift, why that's okay, and show her acceptance of that a little more clearly.  Good conversation to have with the kids I guess.

Very good movie and will definitely watch it a few more times. They kept talking about using their powers to help the community; however, there was clearly an imbalance in how helpful some of them were. Luisa and “healing baked goods mom” seemed to carry the burden. How exactly was super hearing or shape shifting helping the community? And you mean to tell me Poison Ivy could instantly grow crops this whole time, yet she just made flower swings? Just watched it! (obs: i didn't watch the movie in English, so please bare with me any mistakes!)

I liked the movie, but i definently feel... whelmed? I expected more mystery surrounding Bruno and more involvement from the rest of the family outside from Maribel, so that was a bit of a let down. 

The songs in Portuguese sounded off (as it has been with the last few Disney musicals when dubbed), and even hard to understand at points, and all i could think was: ""Man... Lin should be singing this.""

Could relate a lot to the Madrigal sisters, and felt lots of anger for Abuela. Really wished we got to see more of the shapeshifting boy (Camilo? I can't remember), Antonio and Bruno!

The ending was, eh? I wished they didn't get the powers and the miracle back, i felt like it undermined the message a bit.

Also, loved how the musical bits were staged, felt very real without missing the whimsical animated feel!

Score: 7,5/10. Not my favorite, still cried the whole movie long. Talking about the movie with some people, I see that many left the theater confused about the ending, debating if Mirable got her gift after all, or still wondering about the reason she didn’t get one in the first place. To me, it’s clear that the whole point was she didn’t get a “magical gift” because her purpose didn’t rely on magic, and the source of magic was the union of the family and the community. Abuela, like Mirabel, also didn’t have magical gifts. She was a protector of the candle and was meant to provide a guidance to the family, but with time she had forgotten her purpose and the true meaning of the miracle they were given (and the movie understands her reasons, her fears of losing her home and her loved ones once again). So Mirabel’s gift, by not being granted magical powers, was to continue her grandmother’s legacy in keeping the family together and bringing out the best of its members. She is the glue that keeps the magic alive, which is the most important gift of all. Was there a short shown before this movie? What exactly was the grandma's power? 

Also I'm curious: to Latino, specifically Colombian ones, how much did this film resonate with you? What a visually beautiful movie. I honestly enjoyed every minute of it. First off, I really liked the movie. So this is not me saying the movie is bad at all.

But I kinda wish the family *didn't* get their powers back in the end. Casita coming back, sure. But I think it would have been a stronger way of showing that the true gift, the true miracle, was the people and that they could be themselves and thrive even without magic. The problem I have with the movie is that in the beginning and the middle of the movie practically everybody tells Mirabel that: ""He lost his way in the family."" or ""You better figure out the prophecy because HE was coming for you!""(Attention: HE and not the future as the whole) And Pepa in ""We don't talk about Bruno"" literally her whole verse was about how BRUNO ruined her wedding. And then when Bruno finally shows up at the end everybody SUDDENLY accepts Bruno and they all are like ""The triplets finally reunited! Yay!"" or ""Yeah! You're part of our family and we love you, and we definitely NEVER feared or hated you. And we were NEVER accusing you of ruining someone's wedding.""
And I was just sitting like:""What the hell? This family are a bunch of hypocrites!"" 
I'm sorry that was just really bugging me. But the rest of the movie I absolutely loved! Did this feel ahort and rushed to anyone else? Maybe even anti-climatic? It just felt like we got the problem set up at the end of the second act, and the next scene was the resolution, and then it was over. Anyone else wished it was Disney’s Hercules that showed up during surface pressure? Would’ve been a blast if that happened. Enjoyed this quite a bit. It's colorful, catchy, fairly emotional, and honestly the quality of animation on these things is starting to scare me. 

Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this movie from the trailer. But there was one thing I was sure of, and that's that the main character would eventually discover her power and it would be the most powerful of all. I was getting Colombian Umbrella Academy vibes. And since I love being surprised, I have to say I was impressed they didn't go that route.

That said, I'm not 100% on how the plot of this wrapped up. They didn't really define the rules of this magic all that specifically. Which is fine, but even after watching I wasn't totally sure why the magic faltered and why it came back. I guess it had something to do with Abuela becoming so obsessed with the powers themselves and how to utilize them that she wasn't appreciating the simple blessing that is your family? So because of that the powers were taken away, and once she learned her lesson they came back? That sounds right but it wasn't totally clear.

That said, I thought the music, the visuals, and the performances and dialogue were just great. The way the house moved and how everyone used their powers gave it a unique feel in a genre that has no shortage of magic. Had a ton of fun with all the songs and their super trippy music videos thanks to the cool power. This Lin Manuel Miranda guy, I think he's gonna be a big star one day. 

I'd probably give this a solid 8/10. Lots of fun, would rewatch, would bump the soundtrack.

Edit: okay so this was the third movie i watched yesterday and I was a bit tired but after some sleep and listening to the soundtrack again it makes much more sense. I was pretty on track, but basically the family was granted the miracle because of how much the grandmother loved and wanted to protect her family. So when she became more obsessed with collecting family members for their powers, like bu forcing marriages or only appreciating her family for what they offer the community, the power started to crack. It seems Maribel was denied power to try and prove a point to Abuela but she refused to listen and only went harder by not appreciating Maribel for what she is. 

I guess I was just thrown because classically Pixar and Disney will clearly define the rules of their magic worlds and then spend the movie breaking them or pushing boundaries. In this movie there aren't so much rules as there are complex family dynamics that are being paralleled by the magic. 

Still really enjoyed this. Loved the way the characters danced and talked and all the types of songs, and especially the visuals. Sticking to my 8/10.

/r/reviewsbyboner I really enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, I related to Luisa singing about pressure, I loved the songs. I’m a latina in my 30s and I wish this movie had come out when I was a kid, I think it would have been my favorite. Did anyone else notice that Dolores was hinting she still hears Bruno during We don’t talk about Bruno when she said “It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him now”? I'm thrilled that the whole ""every line of dialogue is a cringey one liner or joke"" isn't gonna be a trend for Disney and that Raya And The Last Dragon was a one time thing(what a massive disappointment that was) I thought it was incredible, the critics who have called it a masterpiece are spot on- the details are just so amazing and I was really emotional. I almost can’t fathom how it’s gotten a few negative reviews. Small thing, I liked that everyone dressed pretty monochromatically (and you see it at the end when they’re all standing next to eachother in a rainbow) and Mirabel’s outfit is embroidered with ALL the colors and white I just got back from seeing this with my husband on Thanksgiving. Which is fitting because the reason we even went to the movie theater was because we had no family holiday plans. I knew nothing about this movie going in.. But from the pre movie short onward I cried at least a minimum of five times. 

I am estranged from almost my entire family. I grew up in a dysfunctional family who has huge generational trauma issues that they refuse to acknowledge. Mental health issues run rampant. I think this movie did an exceptional job talking about these issues. The songs were catchy yet quite a few still had emotional weight and showed the different roles people take on in dysfunctional families (the scapegoat, the truth teller, the jokester, the golden child etc.) The colors and the animation were brilliantly eye catching.

I think people who were disappointed by the magic or the way they handled the house falling apart don’t realize that wasn’t really what this film was about. This film was about breaking generational trauma cycles not magic. The magic was just a metaphor for the familial bond and how trauma can be passed down from generation to generation. Mirabel’s gift was that she was a truth teller, and by using it she helped heal her family and herself. I rewatched the movie in English and it was much better. The songs were better worded and made more sense.

Something I noticed about Mirabel is that she was actually super gifted, she is an amazing seamstress, super athletic, a great dancer, excellent with Children, fantastic listener and proficient with words. She is exceptional but since she doesn't have superpowers she looks plain compare to the rest of the family. Sooooo am I the only one who found out that Rosa Diaz actually had an incredibly sweet sounding real voice because of this movie? Far from the Tree

“Oh this looks cute”

*proceeds to tell a tale of inherited trauma*

“And I need to go lay down” I don’t see anyone mentioning how Bruno said “I have a lot to apologize for” at the end. Like what? Are you gonna apologize for how everyone blamed you for the bad things happening and treated you like garbage? The grandmother was really Gaslight Gatekeep Girlboss to the max I have been sitting with how I feel about the music for the past 4 days and relistening to the album to get a good feel into it and I LOVE the music...Hear me out..

When I was at the movies and heard The Family Madrigal, I turned up my nose at the song and was unimpressed. I thought the singing was off beat and awkward. I thought Surface Pressure was super awkward as well and how it turned hip hop-ish felt out of place even though I know that's LMM shtick.

Saying all of that.... Disney knew what they were doing with the casting choice. To understand the cssting choice is to truly understand Maribel's character and what Disney was aiming for.

Maribel is supposed to be the black sheep. She is just average. She basically was no different from the village people so it is no surprise that she does not sing like a typical Disney princess. Being able to sing like that is a gift and Maribel is supposed to be sans gift. 

I compared her voice to Isabelle who is supposed to be the perfect one and she does have the stronger, Disney-esque voice we are used to. However, I have grown to appreciate Maribel's voice. You can tell she can sing and hold a note but it's not this pitch perfect, clear and clean tone----She's nasally, sometimes a bit pitchy and her voice even cracked one time during Waiting On A Miracle.

I will admit that this is one of the weaker LMM projects but I do find myself playing/singing the songs everyday. These are songs that have to grow on you. The standout character in this movie was definitely Dolores. Her soft yet impactful line delivery and the humorous way her powers always came into play were beautifully concocted into Adassa’s performance. I demand a second movie with Dolores in the central plot! I just watched and as a Colombian girl, this movie is **way too fucking real**. Dos Oruguitas got me and everyone else in the theater in a mess. We all left the theater in tears, we have all lost someone to violence or have a history with violence and having to start over. This is not what I expected from a Disney movie. i think that some of the people who feel like “something’s missing” from the movie or thought it needed a central antagonist might be misunderstanding or not realizing that this is a movie about generational trauma resulting from colonization; abuela’s home and husband were violently stolen from her and she’s terrified of it happening again to her family. that’s not an excuse for how she treats mirabel, but once i saw that scene i immediately understood her. honestly, i think it’s more impactful to people from countries and cultures that have experienced violent colonization— it’s one of the reasons it hit so hard for me and all of my fellow latino friends who saw it. Am I the only one who was underwhelmed? Only one of the songs really stood out, most of the characters felt underdeveloped, and the plot felt quite bare. It was beautiful to look at and I loved the South American aesthetic but overall I was disappointed. I came into this movie knowing nothing, but I thought it was really, really good. I think it is especially relatable as someone coming from an immigrant family. The generational trauma of war. Parents who are strict in an attempt to protect their family. The burden of being the eldest daughter who has to shoulder much of the responsibility. The pressure to be perfect, to the point of suppressing your true self and doing things you don’t want for the sake of your family. The self-doubt that comes from having to live up to the achievements of the rest of your family. Literally right before this movie, I had dinner with my friend where we talked about her boyfriend (both Asian as well) and his relationship with his mother and her high expectations and how  “he would never be good enough for her” — a sentiment that was also expressed in this movie. I’m not Latina, but these are all things I’ve seen mirrored in the Asian-American community, and I’m sure many other immigrant communities can also relate. What a lovely movie! The trailer made it seem like some sort of epic adventure that would take Mirabel into a quest to find the origins of magic, but it’s appropriate to the theme of family bonding and the true meaning of “home” that she doesn’t stray far from the “casita”. This is mostly an internal journey, it’s a story of personal awakening and the stakes are pretty low in comparison to other recent animated films. But this movies knows what it is about, has amazing visuals, a great score and its heart is always in the right place. Loved it! I loved the film, wanted more of Pepe and Felix’s side of the family explored especially Dolores and  Camilo. So Dolores can’t turn off her powers, right? She can hear *everything* I get everybody loving We Don’t Talk About Bruno and musically it was great but hot damn was Under the Surface perfect.

First off it’s timing in the story was excellent. Up to that point there are signs that things aren’t so great with the rest of the family but it isn’t completely clear that Mirabel isn’t the problem. The song starts with Luisa toeing the family line. She’s fine, family is fine, shut up. But then she just explodes with all the insecurities and lack of personal identity she (and it turns out her whole generation) are feeling, and the course is set for the rest of the movie. 

Lyrically it’s heavy and relatable as hell. I think a lot of us have had to be “the strong one” at times and some of the lines were just sledgehammers to me. 

*The ship doesn’t swerve as it heard how big the iceberg is*

Besides the awesome midline rhyming (I didn’t actually know Manuel wrote the music to this until I heard this song but then immediately recognized him) I can relate to this so much. People making bad decisions, knowing you’ll take the brunt of the impact, because you always have. It’s just what you do. Steering right into the iceberg because hey, Luisa will split it, no worries!

*I’m prеtty sure I’m worthless if I can’t be of sеrvice*

It’s hinted at in the power ceremony but laid bare here: Abuela has the family convinced their only worth is what they can do for the family and community. You get to see it more later. It’s so easy to lose sight of who you even are when you’re spending all your time and energy putting out other people’s fires. Eventually you *need* the fires.

*Give it to your sister and never wonder*
*If the same pressure would’ve pulled you under*

I’m a 33 year old man and this line made me cry. Because damn, again, I’ve been there. Looking at people putting their burdens on me and knowing they’d never be able to handle it. Knowing they don’t even think about it. It’s a terrible, isolating feeling. 

*Was Hercules ever like “Yo, I don’t wanna fight Cerberus”?*

Awesome unexpected reference and I didn’t necessarily personally connect with this line like the others but I thought it was hilarious and needed highlighting. Great delivery too.

I don’t play Disney music in my car much. But I’ve been playing this constantly since I saw the movie. Abuela should be ashamed her son doesn’t feel welcome If Maribel is 15 and the kids get their gift at 5, then Bruno's been living like that for 10 years... That was absolutely awful. Just imagine him sitting there, while his family dinners together. Wanting to be a part of it, but not feeling welcome.

He was such a good guy. Lived alone in the walls for a decade just because he knew Mirabel would be shunned and shamed if they knew about his vision. Was ready to take all the blame when everything seemed lost and he thought Mirabel was gonna be blamed for it. Yeah, that made me tear up. Well, they didn’t say they don’t sing about Bruno My guy deadass watched his whole extended family sing a complex song and dance number about how they hate him. She said the rats in the walls talk. So she thought it was rats I only wonder how she didn't hear Abuela speaking to the candle before. She might thought she was going crazy. Hell, maybe she thought he was crazy and they had that in common, might've wanted to keep it a secret. I think she mentions in one of first songs that she can hear him but that his whispers sound like dropping sand or something If my math is correct, she has been hearing him for close to 10 years. It's possible she tried to tell someone, but was shut and the ""We don't talk about Bruno"" was initially directly told to her. 

Then she started telling her truth in a way that gave her plausible deniability Her room was the entire house! I thought her gift was going to be bringing people together (Building Bridges) after it's never explained how she is able to get to the other side of the cliff from Bruno's santum. I don't think she actually had a gift at all...at least that's how I saw it. I also love these observations. Disney did so well adding all these small details. I have never seen Disney add so many little cultural references in a single movie before. Even more than Coco. I’m Colombian so this was all so special seeing this in an animated movie. Like adding snacks/meals/juices that are unique to colombia, that my own mom makes at home. As well as the silleteros from Medellin’s flower festival, the different styles of dress in colombia, the music, the Andean and amazonian animals, etc. I also love that they added in the caño cristales. Colombia’s most colorful river 😍 

Edit: My first award too! Thank you all :) Mirabel also has a butterfly embroidered on her dress. Yes! Also when Maribel pointed to the gift under the bed using her lips. A subtle thing but very accurate. I was confused by that! I know miercoles to mean Wednesday. What’s the deeper meaning? Alberto's dad might've immigrated from Colombia. Maybe that's where he went during the movie. Also, a small thing - but her hair. Animating curly hair that realistically could not have been easy. While I was watching it, I couldn't help but think the animators gave her a floofy flowing dress just to show off how skilled they are The thing is that they had recorded the dances with and without the Dresses, so they could properly recreate the legwork underneath and what it does to the cloth over it. Thats quite some attention to detail. >Bawled like a bitch throughout the movie.

I'm not alone!

The tears started when Antonio got his door and didn't stop until the end credits. Same about crying like a bitch. Totally had to pretend my allergies were acting up haha.

Surprised more people aren’t talking about Surface Pressure. That song SLAPS. And also resonates hard with me. This movie fucking *wrecked* me. I’ve been working on my own developmental trauma with my therapist lately and was not braced for this movie lmao. 

It reminds me of the idea of living your life with open hands instead of a closed fist. Abuela lived life with a closed fist to try and protect the family, and it pushed them away and made them feel that they were never enough. Mirabel, growing up under that and without a gift, was forced to learn how to live life with an open hand and showed her family how to accept themselves. Abuela kept the house alive through sheer force of will, Mirabel rebuilt it with love and acceptance when Abuela’s fist finally choked the life out of the family. 

And I’m absolutely in love with the short at the beginning of the film too… it’s a micro telling of the same story. Devil's advocate: losing your house *and all the magic* as the consequence of your bad behavior is a bit more than ""a slap.""

Also, I dunno the exact term for this (if there is one) but sometimes people overblow how terrible life will be if X happens but then calm the fuck down when X happens and they see the world hasn't ended. Abuela Alma strongly believed that if the Encanto ended then *all* is lost and she couldn't see past that (largely because if the trauma of the last time she lost her home, and losing the magic is like losing Pedro all over again.) Once it happened, there was nothing blinding her to the truth of, you still have your family, you still have your village, a house can be rebuilt. Losing the magic sucks but you don't lose everything. Agreed that Surface Pressure is the best. And also the weeping through the whole movie thing. I think they more mean there's no villain, and it's not a traditional US style plot where two people want radically different things and fight for it. Everyone wants the same thing, they just disagree over how to achieve it.

Abuela was totally toxic and the source of most discord for sure. The antagonist was the broken family. The protagonist was the family. A lot of the internet believes that because of generational/childhood trauma, most villains are really just victims whose behavior is excused by their past Can't only look at one side of her though.  She kept her family alive during a civil war after her husband was killed, and built an amazing life for them.  She just wasn't able to shift from hard ass family protector to loving caregiver as times got better, until Mirabel showed her what it was doing to the rest of the family. They all have small designs.

Dolores has sound waves

Luisa dumbbells

The mom has a mortar and pestle

Abuela has little candle flames

Bruno has hourglasses

And mirabel, both young and older, has butterflies I feel the same way about the aunt as well. Both her and Bruno look like they should be cousins. > Recognized Abuela's voice from In The Heights immediately, which was cool. Didn't realize til afterwards that Mirabel was in the movie version as well.

Olga Merediz also played Rosa's (Stephanie Beatriz) mother on Brooklyn 99. I agree Bruno looks quite young, but when they zoom in far enough you see some grey strands in his hair and that makes more sense for his role. Colombians are known for ageing good, maybe is why they look young  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The ending when all the characters are singing their verses at the same time and all have different melodies overlapping is perfection It's such an amazing song!! I can't get it out of my head. Well he helped that one mom take care of her baby I guess The family's position in the community was predicated upon them having gifts and being magical. Abuela saw the loss of her community as well as her home when she and her husband fled. His sacrifice wasn't just for her and his children, it was for the entire community of refugees. So the community is her responsibility in her eyes and to destroy that, is to forsake the sacrifice of her husband. 

She was the architect of this community for so long, which is why everything had to conform to her vision. Isabella had to be married to that other family to strengthen the community, in her eyes. Everyone had to see her family as the strength or else she feared it would crumble. This is why Bruno was ostracized after the community interpreted him as a harbinger of bad news. It hurt her family's position. This is also why Mirabel was kept at arms length. Her lack of a gift made the family look weaker. Again, this is why the little cousin's ceremony was so important to Abuela.

This is all to say, the gift itself was less important than just having a gift. Because having a gift helped maintain the credibility of her family and further strengthened Abuela's idea of the community. I can see Camilo's value to the community when it does come to small things like shapeshifting to be smaller or taller or just another pair of hands, but who the hell was Dolores helping?

Let's be real, in terms of pure function and necessity that community owes a debt to Luisa and Juiletta. Presumably Pepa helps in farming what with being able to provide endless sunshine and rain but does that really matter if Isabella can supergrow vegetables if she put her mind to it? I'm late, but in the opening song Mirabel sings that he uses his power to make people laugh and entertain the community. I think he's just a friendly, outgoing guy that everybody likes. A community needs that. If there's one nitpick I have with the movie is that Camilo doesn't really do anything. Everyone else has a song or an arc or they get pushed to the side cause they have no powers. But what was Camilo's development even? Aside from shape-shifting to complete miscellaneous tasks without fail like babysitting, cheering people up and various errands etc. Camilo also knew EVERYONE in the community on a friendly level. That must make for GREAT PR for the family. Completely agree.  The fight with her and abuela should have happened at Antonio's party, with Mirabella then going...somewhere. Instead, 15 years of mutual resentment is brought out into the open and completely resolved in 5 minutes.

Same thing with Bruno: the dude is ostracized by his family, and one hug from Abuela makes it all better?  The contrast with this and Frozen -- where Elsa still has emotional hangups until the end of the *second* movie -- just highlights how trite this plot was. Exactly this. I also thought the extended side of her family was heavily under used. The weather girl and shape shifting boy were really just there for visual gags and the hearing girl was just there to gossip for that one scene. I thought at least Antonio would be more relevant to the story since he had such a strong relationship with Mirabela but it didn’t really go anywhere once he got his gift. Honestly, this movie shouldn't have been a musical. The songs really don't serve any purpose beyond spending 3 minutes telling the audience exposition we already know. 

The middle of the movie should've been Mirabel witnessing Abuela shutting down her sisters for wanting to pursue other things other than their gifts. We don't see why Luisa has to bottle her emotions or why Isabella must only grow flowers or pretty plants, we're just told they do. Seriously, the lead-in to Isabella's musical number felt so jarringly clunky compared to how smooth say the segue into ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" was.

Isabella seems so immediately self-concerned and surprised at the appearance of the cactus, she's not paying any attention to Mirabel...but then by the end of the song she's attributing this change in perspective *to* Mirabel????

I just wish there had been a little bit more dialogue before Isabella had her emotional breakthrough. Late to the party. I completely agree about the pacing. Luisa having a song was weird to me, until finally Isabella had one. And her immediately befriending Mirabel was rushed. Also, Bruno's vision being Mirabel needing to reconcile with Isabella was very strange. It should have been the grandmother, or the whole family. Completely agree. I know it's a little trite to compared animated films to Frozen, but there Anna and Elsa's fight is right at the beginning and takes the whole film to resolve. Here, tensions between family members were solved in a few moments, whether it was the sister's transformation or the grandmother's self-reflection. Even the fight leading to the destruction of the house was horribly rushed. Totally felt extactly the same. The peace was totally off.

For me the beginning was perfect: the setup of the story, the explanation of the gifts... I was getting ready for some really interesting story. But the middle and end or climax where off... Particularly for me is exactly what you mention about the sister. Something major seems to be needed and one song after it's achieved. Then... not much.

I was a very nice movie for the visuals and some songs but the story left me wanting more. Same! I wanted to love this movie, but can't say I do.

For me it all started with Surface Pressure. It rushed character development sooo much and most other songs after that felt similarly out of place. I felt like songwriting and screenwriting were not really in sync and am left a bit confused by the pacing.

Which is quite a shame because this movie had a lot to love: The concept, the characters, the setting, the visuals. It was just so awkwardly strung together that I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Really a pity. ""You have sweaty palms."" I just wanted to hug him Yes I lived that detail and noticed it right away! Part of my family is Colombian and we legit come in all the skin colors I liked that the ""pretty sister"" was the darker of the two (three). That was maybe my favorite part of the movie. Did a way better job at this than In the Heights Did anyone else notice in La Familia Madrigal that Mirabel’s dad couldn’t dance on beat and he tries to copy Tío Felix? So subtle but I love that! So cute! Definitely accurate for Colombia, but also just accurate for families in general? I don’t share eye colour with any of my siblings, and I am darker than them as well, my cousins are darker yet. My family really goes from my white haired, blue eyed, porcelain skin brother, to my dark skinned, black uncle. There are red heads, brunettes, curly hair, straight hair, pointy noses, wide noses, full lips, wide smiles etc etc. I really loved how this films portrayed a family where everyone doesn’t look identical. I might be reading too far into it but Bruno almost seemed to have OCD. With his whole knock on wood thing. She was also constantly told to just feel better (essentially). Like oh it’s raining, make it stop. No one cares why it’s raining. I absolutely agree. It felt like she was. Even Luisa I found, especially with Surface Pressure and how she explains that she could crumble from all the pressure. It’s so relatable I’m sure to almost everyone on some level because most of us were told to be “tough” when we were really crumbling inside. You must really hate ""friend like me"" then. Surface Pressure is really the only song that did that, but I think it added to it. It’s just a song about how much pressure she is under. I think the visuals made it more impactful for the most part. Particularly the end when more weight is falling on her until the entire house crushes her, but she lifts it back up. I agree that some visuals went too far though, like the dancing donkeys. 

The song with the flower sister was kinda similar, but she was using her power, so it made sense. The other songs were sung around the house and town. Holy shit, you're right. I couldn't put into words why some of the musicals felt off and you did it I didn't mind the Frozen one because it was a one-off gag: the rest of the songs had the characters running around in their own world (ie, Let it Go and For the First Time in Forever). Encanto was more of an issue because it has more songs that relied completely on the concept without a good rationale for it (ie, Olaf is imagining things, while Luisa is just describing her lived experience). Absolutely. The full *Moana* soundtrack features his vocals on some of the demos, so I’m hoping *Encanto*’s get released as well because I can imagine *exactly* how he’d hit each note. He may be too recognizable *""If I can prove, that I never touched my balls...""* Something about the beat of “bring it in bring it in” during What Else Can I Do just feels very him, you also hear it in Vivo’s opening song when he sings pass the hat. I don’t know anything about music so I can’t place it but the rhythm is very distinct to his style. I mostly liked the songs, and they definitely had his touch.  Definitely some echoes of Moana songs in there. Definitely and this may have been one of the first times where I just didnt like that as much. It took me out of the story and I wasnt as immersed as I wanted to be. In Moana I feel like the singers made the songs he wrote their own with their own vocal riffs and vocal prowess. For Encanto it felt like these vocalists were just covering a Lin song at times with the same vocal inflections and range and they didnt take ownership over it if that makes any sense. He’s not bad by any means, I love Moana, In The Heights, and Hamilton. But someone like Anderson-Lopez and Lopez would’ve been so much better for the project. Did you ever watch the making of Frozen 2 on Disney+? They didn't have the ending of the movie until a ridiculously short time before release (like weeks). You hyped me a lot with the violence reference, many people were cautious about that, but now I see this comment I'm glad Disney didn't play safe with that topic I had goosebumps when I saw the attackers have machetes. :( I was wondering, do you think you could tell me about the violence aspect of it, historically? I thought it would be Spanish Colonizers, but that wouldn't make sense logically Dos oruguitas was a beautiful song I'm Colombian and it really hits a nerve about a particular point in time. My grandmother was pregnant with my father when she had to leave her house in the middle of the night to avoid getting killed. It's a real story for way too many people out there I had already cried silent manly tears when Maribel has to watch her cousin open his door. 

Maybe I'm just a sucker for ""what the fuck is wrong with me?"" movies. A couple comments here drew parallels between them, even saying Mirabel's gift might be the ability to unite the family and restore the magic. Might be oversimplified, but still kinda cool, imo. Abuela also said that her husband sent Mirabel to her. I think her hyper focus on the magic needed someone like Mirabel to bring her back. That shows that her husband is still watching out for her. Guess I'm nobody. Maybe try watching it again and let us know what you think?

You may have the same view but I changed my mind immediately after watching it the second time. It's a brilliant movie - watched it many more times since with the kids. I think the third act really faltered, but my wife has been listening to the soundtrack nonstop. She came from an abusive, unloving home, and she really connected with the sense of absurd expectations, ostracization, and emotional abuse. 

I would have been happier with some more flashbacks of Bruno maybe to show the mentioned events from his perspective as a counterpoint to how he's presented by the whole family. It also wrapped up to quickly. Seems like the house exploding should have been the end of Act 2, but the movie wraps up like 5 minutes afterwards. This has aged poorly The iconic Colombian Donkeycorn On Abuela and the resolution: The core of the movie is being able to talk to your family honestly. Open and honest communication. The whole movie, Abuela wants the facade that everything is perfect, and the whole family feels that pressure to the point that they don’t talk about their problems.

Mirabel luckily has pretty open and caring parents, but they 100% were not sitting down with Abuela the way that Mirabel sat down with her mom. Maybe when they were kids, but as adults, they are all worried about keeping everything perfect. 

So the resolutions in this film with each individual character is literally Mirabel finally having honest conversations with her family. She slowly discovers and reveals the truths that her Abuela and family desperately try to keep hidden. All it took for their problems to be resolved is actually discussing them truthfully.

Mirabel has a perception of Isabella that leads to resentment, and vice versa, but neither of their perceptions are based in reality. Isabella doesn’t even like trying to be “perfect”, yet her sister resents her for it. Them finally talking about it reveals that their issues with each other aren’t based in reality. 

And so it goes with Abuela and Mirabel. Abuela had so much trauma and put so much pressure on herself and her family to honor her husband’s sacrifice and the miracle that she lost sight of the family itself. Mirabel forced her to confront something she was avoiding.

Maybe that pacing feels awkward to people, but that’s true to life: once honest communication starts, it’s pretty easy to solve a problem. You can’t solve a problem if you don’t acknowledge it.

On the point of the magic: everything doesn’t need a defined origin. The family was granted a miracle in a time of need, and that’s all we know. It’s tied to the river somehow, the grandmother, and/or the candle. If they tell us that God or some deity of refugees made the miracle, does that add much to the story? Not really. The themes are the same. We understand the miracle as much as the characters understand it. As a Colombian I definitely I agree haha Totally!! It didn't feel forced or like tokenism it felt real and genuine and so it made the diversity even more beautiful.

They also managed to get black Latinos and Colombians to play felix and camilo which is crazy too that they managed to get amazing actors who represented their characters on screen and could sing perfectly I loved how the made the sister that was considered the most beautiful have the darkest skin tone of the sisters. She got a door, though. It was the entire house. She basically ends up with the same gift Abuela has. All my kids initially said they felt disappointed that she didn't get a gift at the end, and I asked them, ""what gift could she have gotten in the end that would not have been a bit of a let-down?""   And they couldn't think of one.  I told them to think about that. Yeah, Raya wasn't the greatest. I liked the story and concept a lot, but I couldn't stand the actual dragon lol. Put a damper on things 


This is more on par with Luca and Soul. I contend that Abuela saw the consequences of her actions in the collapse of the house and Mirabel's ascension to front and center of the family, which took at least some power and status from Abuela.

Having a more vindictive resolution for Abuela would distract the storytelling away from showing the anxiety and generational trauma as the true villains. Physical abuse is just a completely different subject matter and character trait that wouldn't match Abuela's story. She interpreted Bruno's vision as Mirabel destroying the family, and it impacted the way she judged Mirabel's actions which led to emotional abuse.

Abuela did face consequences for her actions (because she was the one who destroyed the family) and she atoned for them in the end. I was listening to Surface Pressure a lot before the film and I kind of wish they had played it a bit more straight like Isabela’s song. Luisa has one of the more emotional songs and we get pop locking donkeys in the middle of it. >  “Waiting for a Miracle” is an interesting take on the usual “I want” song.

Yeah, I found this thoughtful [YouTube comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCYCGh4-bGM) about it

>  This song hits on SO many levels. We get so many Disney songs about empowerment and pulling through, but here we FINALLY have a song where someone admits they are NOT okay. They are HURT, they are VULNERABLE. What I love about Mirabel is while she IS spunk, we get to see her insecurities, her being an underdog. It's OKAY to be these things to not always power through with optimism. Because we are ALL Mirabel in one way. We all feel weaker or inferior and we have to acknowledge this is NORMAL. >Good story overall, though I’d guess some folks might have issues with how the miracle works/doesn’t work

I interpreted the miracle to be fueled by her grandfather's sacrifice. i was expecting her to have to sacrifice something in order to repair the damage done to the house. There are a few videos talking about magical realism and it's place in Encanto. Having seen them I was still a bit thrown off a few times and had to remind myself ""oh yeah, magical realism."" I agree that the soundtrack is actually one of the weaker parts of the movie, with the exception of We Don't Talk About Bruno. That song was fantastic. Saying “Lin Manuel Miranda’s weakest songs” is kinda like saying “Michael Jordan’s worst finals appearance” though. The Colombian historian who worked on this movie says it’s not set in a specific time but it’s set in the early 20th century. Source: https://fb.watch/9x4hSncydK/ The lyrics felt disjointed as well. As if they just picked up normal dialogues to use as lyrics, but didn't adapt them properly That's one reason why I was so mad at the live action of Beauty and the Beast.  As a French speaker, hearing Belle with an English accent was pretty insulting.  You are supposed to FIX and do better the second time around.

Anyway.  I'm happy that this movie was loved by Columbians and Latin Americans. Regarding the character's movement in this film, I actually learned at an event last weekend that there is a good reason for that. According to Matt Walker, Senior Vice President of Music at Disney Animation Studios, they actually changed their usual workflow in regards to choreography specifically for Encanto. Usually, they will bring in choreographers late in the animation process more to get the details right for their characters and to help with certain songs. For Encanto, they brought in choreographers with knowledge of Colombian dance styles early on in the animation process and basically had them act as the animation models for the film's animators. They actually showed us some in-progress animation of ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" side-by-side with the reference footage from the choreographers to compare. 

Really awesome presentation that also had the film's composer Germaine Franco, and the voice actress for Luisa, Jessica Darrow, there in person along with a ton of interview footage from Lin, Stephanie Beatriz (voice of Maribel), and the film's directors talking about various aspects of the film, especially in regards to the music. Also got to see some really cool behind-the-scenes footage that I hope makes it to the physical release or something. I disagree with the Bruno take.

He was never truly ""shunned"", everyone immediately welcomed him because no one wanted him to be gone in the first place. No one ""talks about Bruno"" because everyone assumes that everyone else is mad at him and they don't want to be the one to start a fight. Definitely a great movie although I do agree with you that abuela's redemption never felt earned. She told her to stay out of the way when it comes to helping others, acts like mirabel some home intruder ever since she didn't give a gift, and blames all of the problems on mirabel but apparently, we have to feel sorry for her. Great movie and I loved the rest of the characters, plot, animation, and songs yet abuela is the weakest link of this movie The village seemed pretty happy with her. And I'm sure any lost pets were immediately found by Dolores. Poison Isa was groomed to perfections since she was born, so she only knew she could grow perfect flowers, which I suppose did a good job decorating the city. That's why breaking out of the perfect mold and creating a cactus baffled her so much.  


Maybe now she can grow all the crops and end world hunger Camilo being a trickster and theatrical type character could help with entertaining villagers and keeping them happy in that way, for example in the family introduction song Maribel says that Camilo likes to make others smile. His job could be to entertain and keep spirits light. Dolores’ ability could be used for finding lost people or if someone is in need of help and nobody is around to hear them calling, she would. Antonio’s communication with animals means the village has their own bodyguards and animal army if anything goes down, and he can get them to help villagers too. 

The cousins and their parents were clearly meant to be side characters and I wish they were more fleshed out too but there wouldn’t have been enough time. I enjoyed all the characters and their abilities though, I could see Encanto getting a show the way Tangled did. My friend I think you missed the point. The whole point was some of their gifts were more useful.
Others carried more burden than others. That's....the entire point of Isabella though. She wasn't allowed to grow and be herself and well, even help others except to be the perfect face of the family while Luisa was never really that huge a player in the family events and was only ever used for help. Yeah, Far From the Tree, I think. A story about raccoons. Colombian here. We’re much hyped by this movie, specially after the great job they did with Coco. I can’t put in words how I felt when we learn that the whole thing started with an episode of violence and displacement. That scene of people leaving their home at night running away hits too deep, as it’s the story of hundreds of thousands of colombians. Magic was the way to deal with pain in the movie, and in reality you see communities trying to overcome the situation by putting a bright smile, never losing hope and helping each other, so it was lovely to see.

Other than that, the colors, the music, the food, the Spanish dubbing with a local accent, the animals, the plants, the natural landscapes… everything was on point, and a joy to watch on a film of this scale. I’m Latino. I really enjoyed seeing how the three sisters had different skin tones. I’m a lot lighter than my siblings (probably Luisa’s skintone), and I thought that it was really nice to have Disney show us that Latinos come in all different skin tones, something that most media especially childrens media won’t really show. Surviving brother. Surviving. 

Surviving, and growing a big, beautiful family from the ashes of what has been a sad reality in our country in the past.

Despite her flaws - Abuela had what we call “berraquera”, that’s a gift in and of itself. She had a role more than a power. And she was already too old when the magic was established. At least that's what I'm going with.

I was born in the US, but this movie really knocked it out of the park for me, and my family's group chat has been spammed with video and article links in anticipation (most of which probably weren't even by me!) I only wish there were more minutes of it to enjoy. I'd totally be down for an Encanto 2. One of the prettiest films from Disney to date. So wonderfully full of life and love with it's warm and bright colors. I think the family was always fracturing, but (like the house) only Mirabel could see it at first.

From the aunt who was always pressured to have a literal sunny disposition, to Luisa who was only valued for her physical strength, to Isabela who was going to be forced into a life that other people thought was perfect for her - most of them were a lot more miserable than they were willing to admit, but they kept on pretending that the miracle was wonderful. Even Bruno was shunned whenever his visions contradicted the everything-is-perfect vibe that Abuela wanted to maintain. And of course Mirabel was always subtly viewed as lesser than everyone else. As time went on, the gifts started to become the ONLY thing they valued about themselves or each other, and that's when the magic started to fail. It came back after Mirabel's work to help the family acknowledge themselves as an actual, sometimes-flawed family rather than a perfect collection of superpowers.

That's why it was a nice touch that Mirabel's ""door"" ended up being the entrance to the house itself - even if she doesn't have a magical gift, she rebuilt the house and the family into something better and stronger, and all the other powers are contained inside the work that she did. as a colombian i felt it completely wrapped up. the real magic is found in the comunal experience not in the individual super powers of any of them. the grandma realizing she needed to confide in others and release her trauma allowed for the rest of town to finally feel welcome, then maribel puts the last touch in the door and because of all the town being involved in the construction they realizes that magic was inside all of them all along. 

i might be wrong. but thats a common ending to some famous colombian books where it seems they drew inspiration- and i’m glad they did that because it also subverts the usual trope of the hero randomly developing power last minute. > That said, I'm not 100% on how the plot of this wrapped up. They didn't really define the rules of this magic all that specifically. Which is fine, but even after watching I wasn't totally sure why the magic faltered and why it came back. I guess it had something to do with Abuela becoming so obsessed with the powers themselves and how to utilize them that she wasn't appreciating the simple blessing that is your family? So because of that the powers were taken away, and once she learned her lesson they came back? That sounds right but it wasn't totally clear.

I think you're on point. 

The more fractured the family became, the more the powers/Casita weakened... it only came back when they put aside every other concern and focused on their family. I wondered about the magic rules, but I think the vagueness was intentional. Think of old fairytale tropes where magic doesn’t really have comprehensible rules. Why does true love’s kiss break curses? Why does Cinderella have a fairy godmother? Why do some animals talk? And so on. A running gag seems to be that Dolores knows about everything going on but she’s too meek to act on it. I figure she was worried she was going crazy, possibly even inheriting his curse and at risk of suffering his fate. I was immensely disappointed with Raya, glad I wasn't the only one. I'm a huge Disney princess fan, and I was excited for Raya, but did not like it at all.  I was hoping Mirabel would be a princess too, and I loved Encanto so much, but it doesn't seem like her story is following the typical Disney princess formula. Even if she doesn't become a princess, still loved the movie and her story. I like how they didn't give her a gift and it seemed like her destiny was always to follow in her abuela's footsteps as the glue that holds the family together. Btw, what would you recommend? Should I watch it in 3D or 2D? Same! Also, a small thing with Juiletta's side of the family but her, her husband, Luisa and Mirabel all wear a shade of blue *except* for Isabella.

Why? Because Isbaella always had to be somebody else *for* somebody else.

What does she do at the end of the film? Gives herself a dark blue dress! Similar situations, similar reactions. I also cried most of the way home.

Still, I'm glad I didn't know all the triggers it contained or I might've skipped a truly beautiful movie. She is their emotional Cinderella. Mirabel is the family therapist. Empathy powers activate. It's basically a Colombian elementary school teacher. She even looks like mine lol I thought the plot structure was a bit uneven. The house loses its magic and falls apart and then like 10 minutes later, and one song montage later, it's back together and the movie ends. I feel like it would've been better off if the house losing its magic happened earlier in the movie and they had to spend longer putting it back together. People have grown up to think the terms antagonist and villain are synonymous terms. I don't really understand it. Like, it's possible for a plot's antagonist to be largely thematic. Not every story needs an evil villain. Us growing up with this mindset contributed to a lot of problems with narcissism, because we've been saturated with media where there are clear cut good people who do nothing wrong ever, and clear cut bad people who are the source of all of life's problems. 

Real life doesn't work that way, and I think this movie does an amazing job of introducing interpersonal nuance to younger generations. Colonization? There's a very obvious refugee angle but where does colonization come into it? There was nothing related to colonisation in the movie. The war scenes symbolise ""la violencia"" Are you positive colonization is a theme of this film? That strikes me as an assumption but more than happy to be educated if I’m wrong. accurate for the generational trauma, but in colombias case this represented la violencia. A civil war that started in the 1950s, and in some ways is still going on today. But yeah the generational trauma is something all latino people can feel. You're not far off.  I definitely liked it more than you did, but I agree, the songs weren't as good as I hoped (though I did really like a few of them) and you're also spot-on that most of the characters were *very* underdeveloped.  I'm thinking of the changeling kid used for physical comedy, and the super-hearing girl, who apparently can only hear things when it's convenient for the plot.  Dad was just a foil for bee-sting laughs, and Mom was disappointingly under-protective of Mirabel. Plot was definitely too simple, but fine, it wasn't a murder-mystery and needs to be digestible by kids.  

I loved how well the characters moved and danced and were animated though. I'll watch this again. It seemed like a movie thats focus was on showing a latin american family and giving each member some time to shine. The plot was just about the family and little about the actual conflict. I kinda was hoping Mirabel went on a journey with Bruno to find some hidden truth about the family they didn't know about but that never really happened. Instead it seemed like they made sure each member got *just* enough time to be on screen. You're not. My mom had a reaction that was basically ""they're not pushing any boundries"". I've seen others (Breakfast all day) that complained about the lack of originality.

Personally, I think some stories are going to natrually hit harder than others. 

For me, the feeling of being ostracized and questioning why other people have things that you don't have hit really hard. I know that other people really connected with Coco and that movie didn't mean much to me, as I never had a grandparent I was close to. I also think visually the movie had clear influences of magical realism and the music felt fresh enough to keep me entertained. 

I had issues with the third act but overall I very much enjoyed the movie. 

To each his or her own. Yeah, I had a similar issue with the characters. I don’t think all of them needed to be developed. If you have a movie centered around a large family of wacky characters, it’s fine if some of them are just there for a couple of jokes or maybe to help advance one plot point. But, I feel like there were a couple of key relationships in the movie that didn’t get enough attention. Like I think that Mirabel’s sister, who could grow flowers, should have been developed more. 

And then there was the kid at the beginning who could talk to animals. The movie spent a lot of time establishing that he had a close connection to Mirabel, and then I thought that relationship was going to be more important to the story. But it wasn’t really. Really feel like Camilo's verse in ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" showcased his personality, just him reveling in pumping up the legend of Bruno. Definitely would've enjoyed seeing more. I hated Abuela. Is her super power being a cunt? I’m probably bitter because my mother in law treats my wife like Abuela Treats Mirabel. Abuela more like ABITCH Abuela should be ashamed Mirabel is unwelcomed.

Deadass just left her in the nursery? Couldn't be assed to get her her own room even though she had no magic? Doomed for all eternity to take care of her cousins aged 1-5 (5 of them incoming!) and just be fine when they leave and get their own rooms? that boy aint right i said this to my friends kind of stunned. might be the most slightly depressed thing ever in a disney money Bruno is Mirabel's uncle, and being one of a set of triplets, is the same age as Mirabel's mother and aunt.  Apparently, he didn't disappear immediately.

What is really messed up is that Dolores admits that she knew Bruno was there all that time, (super hearing), and saying nothing to anyone, even though they make a point about her being the gossip in the family. i was sobbing from that point on lmao ""They didn't saY I couldn't siNNnGggGg"" - Cat Valentine, Victorious Supervillain origin story. Not only that, he started to vibe with the song! he was even dancing along in the background to it. sneaky boi STOP- 😭 in “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” she sings “I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling”, and if taken literally, she has always heard him and knows it’s not rats. I think she lied, Luisa knew about the problems with magic but didn't want to admit it, I think Dolores was doing the same She could've been sleeping. I wonder if her room mutes the outside world for her [deleted] Yeah, but is she still sleeping in the nursery? Maybe Isabela can grow her a flower bed in the corner of her room or something. Or she can sleep on one of Luisa's punching bags that I'm sure her room is full of. I agree, that her Door was the Houses, but I am sure the Family thought about Mirabel while remaking Casita. Her room may not be magical, but I think neither was Grandmas. The Center of the family still needs to be grounded and normal. I was thinking the whole movie that Casita was her gift I feel like that’s kind of a copout if she still has to sleep in the nursery. And while I guess we should assume that they made her a room when rebuilding the house, that in particular should’ve been more explicit since she also doesn’t get a superpower when the family get theirs back.

And if the casita can make her a new room now, then it stands to reason that could’ve given her one the entire time but didn’t (probably because of abuela). I thought it was going to be something to do with sight--like a type of figurative sight where she can see and understand what's going on with all her family members--because her glasses were green like Bruno's future-vision magic and the shortened version of her name is the command form of ""to look"" in Spanish (""Mira!"").  Arguably she's still got that talent--it's just not magical. Okay so here’s a theory: she herself is an aspect of the Miracle itself. There’s an odd pattern of her being able to read the characters’ private thoughts and feelings. It’s like she hears them mention a short sentence about what they think and she can extrapolate the rest of the information that’s revealed in the non-diagetic songs (such as We Don’t Talk About Bruno). It’s like she is able to glean additional information from everyone in the family. She also has an odd additional ability tied to Casita. Everyone else in the family seems to just live with Casita as an assistant, and can at most recognize how Casita imitates human expressions to talk. It’s only Mirabel who can actually take advice from Casita like she can hear them. The house’s state seems to be tied to her anxiety and stress. When Isabela lets go and Mirabel sees the cracks next to the candle start to close, it isn’t Isabela affecting it but Mirabel’s joy at helping and reconnecting with her sister that repairs the cracks (also literally repairing the cracks of the family). Lastly, the end of the movie when they gave her the doorknob for the front door. Her door isn’t a room inside the house, it’s the entire house itself. I view her gift as being the same as Abuela’s - the source of the magic/what holds the family together to clarify, i figure her gift is herself, no magic and not perfect but enough and worthy just as she is Moana is chokka with polynesian cultural references. It's really nice Disney are taking the care in these films. When Mirabel points to Antonio’s gift with her lips, my husband (Honduran) and I (Belizean) lost it. I had just done the same to my child not 5 seconds before 😂 Pointing with your lips is also done by a lot of Native North Americans. I also found out Filipinos do it too. It's a tone down way of saying ""mierda"" (shit). So instead of swearing, we just say ""mier-coles"" It's a cutesy way of saying ""shit!"" around children. ""Mierda!"" means shit, and ""miercoles"" is Wednesday. It's like replacing the word fuck with fudge It's the same in French.

People were saying ""Mercredi"" (Wednesday) instead of ""Merde"" (shit).

Mer...credi. Or viceversa, after all South America is full of Italian immigrants That was the first thing I noticed in the movie. Her hair was absolutely devine. I am not sure it anyone else noticed but they were great about detail as you could see arm hair on the girls. That's part of what made up Tangled's ginormous budget ($260 million: the second largest film budget of all time when it was made; 15th now): they spent a tonne of money on improving hair animation, and it has shown in every Disney animated movie made since. Everyone's hair in this film was an absolute visual journey. Disney Animation's (and Pixar too with Brave) essentially just mastered the crap out of hair animation in the last several years in 3D work with Tangled and Moana, I think they literally created their own proprietary software that focuses on making it so visually magical. Second to none. Absolutely they did, along with her hair. They did the same thing with Merida in Brave. There's always one aspect of CGI in Disney movies where the animators get to flex/develop the technology

*Tangled:* Hair animation

*Wreck-It Ralph:* Crowd scenes (with the bugs and in the arcade)

*Frozen* and *Frozen II:* snow physics (fun fact: the snow physics for those movies was accurate enough [that it solved a real-life murder case)](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/02/engineers-frozen-animation-code-dyatlov-pass-mystery-1234614083/)

*Big Hero 6:* [animating light/neon, to accurately show off San Francisco](https://www.tampabay.com/news/business/software-behind-big-hero-6-pushes-limits-on-computer-animation/2219350/)

*Zootopia:* animating fur [(the polar bears have different fur animation to Nick Wilde, a fox, and the mice have something different to both)](https://www.screendaily.com/features/zootopia-the-painstaking-journey-behind-a-billion-dollar-hit/5111636.article)

*Moana:* Water physics, where, again, [they invented new software to do it right](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1553760/the-amazing-effects-system-disney-had-to-invent-in-order-to-pull-off-moanas-ocean-scenes)

*Raya and the Last Dragon:* mostly used technology/software from the previous films all together, [but also, they did it during a pandemic](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/making-history-while-making-raya-and-the-last-dragon/)

And now we have *Encanto,* [where the flexes were enhanced lighting software, Isabella's flowers, and rendering some of the costumes thread-by-thread](https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2021/11/encanto.html)

So yeah, pretty dope I also couldn’t stop crying the whole time - I feel like it absolutely nails familial pressure and it resonated with my past and how my family has changed over the years Omg SAME. Glad it wasnt just me I love in the end song, she says ""I'm strong, but sometimes I cry.."" and her sisters hug her and say ""Me too!"" And just smile. Like damn thank you for the excellent message lol. Pretty good movie. I just cry openly lol. What they gonna do, silently judge me? Ill never see them again lol The Dos Orugitos flashback wrecked me and continues to wreck me. It puts *everything* into context - they told the story in the beginning, but only in the flashback do you get an actual feeling and understanding of what was lost. The uplifting hopefulness of the song juxtaposing the tragedy and that face of absolute anguish and omg Abuela Alma had a thousand yard stare when she was sitting in her new house with the babies. And then she put the shawl on and it's like, *oh* she's been in *constant* mourning this whole time and it's been blinding her. I've been playing the song non-stop, I love it so much! The protagonist was Mirabel. Thats simply not how it works You can be both a victim and an abuser. The two are not mutually exclusive.

Also while there are a good deal of people who will excuse a person's actions because of their past, there are plenty who view it as Mirabel does. Not an excuse but an explanation leading to an understanding of why they acted the way they did and empathy for the feelings that drove the behavior while still recognizing the behavior that resulted was wrong. This is why Mirabel can forgive and then follow up that Abeula needs to be an active participant in fixing what she broke.

I would say that there is a difference between an antagonist and a villain as well. Antagonist basically being someone who challenges the protagonist in some way but mostly causing them difficulty. While a villain is not only an antagonist but is actively setting out to cause harm and trouble for the protagonist or other people. Abuela is an antagonist and she might be awful. But she doesn't fall into villain for me because she isn't malicious enough. She hurts people because she is attempting to help by maintaining control. 

You can argue she's really protecting herself from potential loss rather than trying to protect her family and the magic for the sake of the town. A selfishness rooted in a deep fear of loss. But for me that still isn't enough to push her into true villain territory as the movie plays it that she doesn't realize how miserable she is making everyone and she stops as soon as she realizes that she was the cause of serious hurt. I don’t think they are nessecary too young for aunt and uncle, but since they made kids triplets they do look too young compared to Mirabel’s mom. The polyphony in the song nearly had me twerking in the movie theater! Absolute perfection! It’s a signature of Lin Manuel Miranda, I always love it just watched that part. LMM is seriously soooo good at doing that kind of thing in particular. if you like that kinda stuff check out Blackout and Carnival de Barrio from In the Heights! And he hung up banners like a boss as long as there was another tall person to copy. Yes, I wanted to see more of Camilo but the focus is on Mirabel’s journey. Some babies are challenging to comfort by anyone other than their mother, so Camilo “tagging out” with the tired mommas of the town is one way he helps. It would be interesting to see shorts made of the Madrigals with less screen time going about their day. Unfortunately, even with the wonderful magical realism  and redemption here I couldn't help seeing this story in a wider social context. The matriarch's family (with their area-dominating hacienda and control over the town) represent both a longing for a ""simpler time"" and a metaphor for post *La Violencia* consolidation of  land ownership.  It is implicit that the town cannot survive without the family's ""magical gifts"" in the same way that landed gentry (or narcotraffickers) bestow protection and relief on the surrounding countryside.  Here, the pride (and failure to respond to reality) of the matriarch results in the destruction of the house, but inexplicably the townspeople, who have presumably become dependent on the family's largesse, help them rebuild it. Once the peasants have rebuilt the hacienda, the family once again gains power (magic), and once again that magic is retained by the family and not conferred on the peasants.   That is a story that plantation owners (or oligarchs) of many different centuries would find comforting. dolores act as a ear to the family, she always knows whats happening around

during the party prep scene abuela asks her if anyone is going to be late, and we can also presume she is a huge help to the elderly because she can hear if they're in dire need, even finding mirabel after she ran away would be a breeze if she still had her gift I mean, considering the context in which the encanto was given to the family, I feel like all the gifts could be pretty useful if those circumstances were to repeat… Dolores could hear enemies coming, and Camilo would be the perfect spy… His shapeshifting gave viewers the coolest part in 'We Dont Talk About Bruno' is the most we got from his character I agree the end was too fast, but the fight had to happen after the revelations that Abuela was harming the rest of the family through her expectations. 

Luisa, Isabella, Bruno and Adassa all were victims of their matriarch's designs. That made Mirabel's accusations hit harder because you knew the problem was bigger than just a grandmother disappointed in her granddaughter. 

If the confrontation happened at the beginning of the movie, it would be ""You are hurting ME"" whereas having it after everything else turned it into ""You are hurting OUR FAMILY"". That's the entire point of the film.

But it does get resolved super quick after that. Then again, it would be hard to add much to the third act without it feeling like filler. I think the fact that the grandma did all of her pressuring for perfection without explicitly expressing it most of the time is integral to the film. Generational trauma is often insidious in the way that it seeps into the next generation through repeated subtle actions and a vibe of “this is just how it is.” This is exactly it. I LOVE musicals but the lyrics in this were just so weak. Hamilton had GREAT lyrics, but these felt so juvenile and basic to me. On top of that, I sort of got the impression that these songs weren’t flattering to the actors’ singing voices? It’s hard to tell. I LOVED the movie, I was just disappointed in some aspects of the music. The songs are raging in popularity and I feel like the songs are mostly disconnected from the movie. ""Surface Pressure"" is a powerful song that is completely abandoned by the movie. The song gives the older sister so much characterization and the movie mostly ignores her. There's a lot of depth to explore there and - where is it? I know a LOT of people have misunderstood the movie as the popularity of the Bruno song has confused a ton of non-watchers what this movie is about. Meanwhile, a song that actually has bearing on the movie and on the story in ""What Else Can I Do"" doesn't seem to resonate with people who didn't view the movie, but it's easily the musical peak of the movie, tying the story and the music together (though I have issues with the plot and with this story element). I couldn’t agree more. The first twenty minutes were great and set up such great conditions for an awesome payoff later—Antonio’s relationship with Mirabel most of all. Then Surface Pressure came and I was like “Oh nooo…” It was so incredibly wordy and told us every facet of how she was feeling without us having spent any time with her to make the insights of the song actively meaningful.

And the rest of the film had some enjoyable moments, but was mostly a letdown plot-wise. No Antonio payoff, awful pacing, almost zero believable + meaningful character development, super rushed ending, and the internal logic was inconsistent and confusing, especially about how the miracle works. Very disappointing—I had high expectations. First thing he says to any of his family in a decade. 😅 I audibly laughed at that, great character same and had an overturned indigenous nose She also wasn't stick thin! A welcome change from a lot of Disney movies. I was thinking the same thing. I watched this and West Side Story as a double feature and they both do a much better job showing multiple skin tones. In the Heights did the typical thing and used mostly fair skinned hispanics. I don't need to see it but it's nice to see my type of skin tone being represented. I've heard that that, along with him throwing salt at Mirabel are superstitions that are supposed to bring you good luck. Definitely not OCD. 

He was incredibly superstitious because of his powers, so he would do everything he can to try and keep things correct and on the positive side. 

OCD is a lot more than touching a doorknob a certain amount of times. Intrusive thoughts that one has no control over or the ability to prevent, and in some cases act upon. I have OCD and when he first started his rituals (knocking/throwing salt/etc.) I immediately read the behaviors as OCD in nature e.g. ""if I do X, Bad Things won't happen"" which makes even more sense for his character as he was perceived as a harbinger of doom even though he and his visions didn't cause anything Yeah I have an anxiety disorder and I really got that impression. She kinda does positive affirmation at one point by saying ""clear skies, clear skies"" to try to make her rain go away. 

I especially like the detail of how Bruno just wanted to tell her at her wedding that he saw she was nervous, and she shouldn't have to hide her feelings. But that caused a storm, which of course she and Bruno were blamed for. Friend like me works because it also serves a purpose of introducing us to the Genie and just how expansive his powerset is He is literally magic in a magic cave, it fits there Or “I just can’t wait to be king” Vivo was just Hamilton as a monkey Yes. He has such an influence on musicals today that this entire genre in the past decade sounds the same.

The only songs I truly felt fit the movie were the credits scene and the folk one in Spanish. I really wish they had an actual Colombian artist write the music. Coco had such an impact because of the artists surrounding that project. I sincerely hope that LMM does something new in the future, do some thing weird and niche, don't keep doing these mainstream projects (I'm pretty sure he's writing a bunch of new music for the live action Little Mermaid, so that ship has already sailed). 

I like In the Heights, I like Hamilton, I like the song that Dwayne The Rock Johnson sang in Moana and I think there were some good songs here, but there are diminishing returns. I don’t understand this criticism. I love LMM and he’s an obviously talented writer (as well as a decent actor), do y’all want writers to be invisible and unrecognized for their work? They do more important work than the actors imo but only the actors get the fame and credit most of the time. LMM is changing that and that’s a good thing. Might I interest you in [this?](https://youtube.com/shorts/uecKcRyl4z4?feature=share) *""The room where you scratched them, The room where you scratched them""* 🎶*I am MIRABEL*🎶

To the tune of I am Moana I think I should at this point. Something is horribly wrong st the House if Mouse and yet people keep praising these disasters anyway. The 1992 Aladdin animation movie was re-written almost completely a year before it's release.

I prefer a re-write than writing a story without a plan.  Frozen 2 had so much potential, I was so excited about the trailer.  But it was like the first one, a little all over the place. Do you mean render the ending or actually write it? Because I can't see how they could write, edit, voice, animate, and render an ending in 2 weeks. yaaaaa. they obviously don’t show anything gory. but they’re super explicit, never thought id see that in a disney movie. They 100% highlighted that on purpose. As someone not familiar with Colombia, I assumed they were conquistadors but the machetes threw this off. It actually led me to look into the movie further. La Violencia (1946-1964), is what is actually referred in the movie, I believe. It was a conflict between two political parties: Conservadores and Liberales, it evolved later to the guerrilla, paramilitary forces and the whole connection with the widely known narcotrafic. 
Political reasons and ideologies aside, this conflict brought countless of Desplazados, people from rural areas running away of having their homes taken. I was brought up in Bogotá and remember seeing countless of families asking for money on the streets, saying they were displaced from home. 
The concept of having to leave behind your home to find a future for your family starting from zero resonates a lot as colombian. My wife is Colombian, and it was also very real and hit her heart. My wife's abuela is the very strong matriarch, like in the movie, but when her abuela was younger with seven(!) children, they had to flee the countryside because of the violence from the guerillas. Shortly after, my wife's abuelo died in an accident and her abuela had to raise the family starting from scratch. What timeframe is it from? Drug wars ? In that part I also remember that my grandfather from mother side should abandoned his land in the same period he was liberal, some years later we travel with him to his home town and he re unite with an old friend of himself that was in the opposite band that was a family member from my father side, they never get involved in violence. My grandfather just die last year at 89 years old Same dude. The movie hit me in the right places I felt that Mirabel’s gift was to take over for Abuela. The magic chose her to live on through. I keep saying that the grandfather is the house! She’s the only one to really interact with the house and even understands it!
She’s the essence of home and family and the saying goes home is where the heart is and she is the houses heart
I feel like the house (grandpa)
knew she was meant for a greater purpose and she was the message for the grandmother from her husband like don’t forget my sacrifice and what family really means. I\`ll join the gang of nobodies here. These songs are so different yet great. I especially like ""We don\`t talk about bruno"", the families introduction song  and "" Surface pressure"". Same Yep, looks exactly like my Colombian wife's extended family. Funnily enough, Maribel looks just like my wife, and Isabela looks exactly like her sister. Yes I caught that too. She and Abuela basically share the same gift, plus I felt like there were implications that Mirabel could restore the entire house because she was a source of the magic. 

(I got the implication the magic/miracle happened because of Abuelo Pedro's sacrifice for his family and I felt like they implied Mirabel was similar to him in that she was also a selfless soul, hence the magic returning.) The ability to pull food out of a television program/movie. She could've gotten the ability to create magical houses like Casita. Her bringing back Casita could've also been her power awakening It felt like they picked a moral at random, trust, and tried to shove it into the story. Literally everything they face contradicts the moral and so it made it all feel too forced which also made Sisu extra sucky because she was the vehicle for the moral. I get what you're saying, but she didn't see the vision till later in the movie. So she just treated Mirabel like shit cause she had no gift and was useless to the family. Yeah, that was kind of weird to me. The song was emotional and showing that the tough one has weakness too but we are watching donkeys and Luisa do like TikTok dances during it, lol. Kind of a weird pairing. I felt it was appropriate. Luisa was a typical millennial/Gen Z who is acknowledging and facing their pain, but doesn’t know how to deal with it and remain functional, so she covered with fun and happy looking by social commentary. I identified with it a lot. In fairness I was crying at the pop locking donkeys. And the donkeycorns Man I keep bouncing around the soundtrack for my favorite song... I'm glad you guys have so much great music in your lives because if this is bad I must listen to trash. That makes sense, but Bruno mentioned telenovellas That was about my guess. They had cameras but no cars It felt as if they were singing for the sake of singing but there wasn't a song Colombians* They may not have wanted him to leave, but they definitely made him feel unwelcome. I understand the potential for them being useful to the town, I just think they could have actually shown them being useful instead of being there for gags. Exactly, there was even a whole song about it. (Surface pressure) A fantastic short about having enough self awareness to not pass your childhood traumas onto your own children. But with raccoons and no words. Just so you know, Encanto is Disney, but Coco is Pixar (sister studios, but different studios nonetheless). I made the same remark. I'm glad they didn't just make everyone white. Yeah the house was fracturing for a long time.  You could see it in the scenes with Bruno, he didn’t just start making mortar, he’d been doing it for awhile Spot on analysis. Abuela's gift was the candle and the house itself. She's the steward of the magic that granted everyone else their gifts. And now that Mirabel is on the front door, I interpret that as her gift being the same. She's Abuela's successor. I love this take. The scene of the community coming to rebuild their house had me in tears. We are strongest together, and our individual worth is not based on what we alone produce. Our value is much more than that. A lot of Colombian magical realism tropes in this. Also the not so subtle Marquez shout out with the aunt with amnesia falling for her nephew. Yes, this is the take I got.  Grandma over-cherished the magical gifts and was obsessed with putting on a good show to maintain the public's reverence of her family and that caused, over time, the neglect of her relationships and the fracturing of the family.  Because the magic was based on the familial bond, rather than being the source of it, it too became a physical representation of that ""unstable foundation,"" which Mirabel explicitly referenced as being renewed in the end. This was probably a nod to Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the magical realism genre, in which magic is intertwined with reality and has no reason to be other than to represent a state of truth or condition in the world. It’s just there and happens. I’ve only seen it in 2D, but I work at the studio (and on this movie) and I wanna make a plug for checking it out in 3D because I know the stereo team worked really hard to design every shot so it’s extra beautiful in that version! Hoping to catch the 3D version myself soon :) I also think the movie moves really quickly from ""It's okay that we lost our gifts. Maribel has never had a gift and we love her"" to ""Thank God we got our gifts back!"" yes!!!! Thank you.  

i think I had a few issues with the film - we should have gotten and apology song from the family to Bruno. We have an entire song taking about hating him - they could have given us a reprise of all the reasons they loved him. 

i was kind of hoping it would slowly become an adventure movie. Abuela and Mirabel would go off to find bruno - and the family would join or something.

The film is cute and warm and sometimes that’s all you need BUT the script was kiiiiind of weak for me. :/ Probably unpopular opinion, but I’ve never been a huge Lin Manuel Miranda fan.  I don’t really like the I,m going to speak/sing really fast and call it a song.  At times the music just felt a tad rushed because of it.  I enjoyed the film overall though! Does she even have an actual power? She was given the candle and created the family but I don’t recall her having a literal power? No, that's just life with a Colombian mother. Source: I'm a Colombian I agree she was a hard character to like. However what makes her different from a narcissist or gaslighting is that she does have a change of heart and sees the error of her ways. Which honestly is the best someone can ask from someone like that, she definitely was not on Mother Gothel’s level. Elsa trapped in her room alone since a young child afraid of human interaction is depressing, too. They don't talk about Bruno She mentioned early on about the rats in the walls knowing, and I wondered why no one went to Antonio to ask the rats, ""homies whats going on here?"" If she said something about him being there, they wouldn’t be happy. I took that more as Dolores protecting Bruno and letting him stay close rather than potentially driving him away. Frollo - it’s not my fault Hernando, is the supervillian, he's scared of nothing!!! Jorge does the spackle... Literally my favourite thing I thought that was Camilo getting ready for his part 😅 Can you actually see him dancing in it? She also literally admits to having heard him all these years during that one song in the end. But she probably was raised to never ever ever mention that she hears him. The family cut him off and wanted nothing to do with him after he ran away without a trace. If she tried telling her family she thinks she hears Bruno, they’ll just get upset with her like they did Mirabel. And this family is all about staying in each other’s good graces. The 'gift of denial' is mentioned at the beginning, but it was everyone else but the glasses chick what had it.

I think this is the first Disney movie written for parents and not kids; hopefully they can see the message. She heard Luisa’s eye twitching all night, so probably not unless they literally partied all night without sleeping In the lyrics she says “I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling. I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch” It's kind of fucked up the nursery just ""became"" Mirabel's room over time in a house *where they literally could have asked it to build her her own space*. Exactly - if Abuela got a room with a shiny door, Mirabel deserves one, too! Yeah. Did anyone else talk to it like she did? She really seemed to commune with the house. I was guessing the same thing. So many great scenes of her visualizing and understanding her family members inner struggles. 

I was happy she didn’t actually get a “gift” tho Mirabel is tied to the house the same way she's tied to her family. The stronger each of her relationships are with everyone, the stronger Casita is too.

""Building a new foundation"" wasn't just about the building, but creating a new understanding of each other and how everyone is apart of the family.

Mirabel didn't have a dedicated room, and she's the only character we see come and go from everyone else's room (Antonio being the exception as everyone was invited everyone in for the party). I agree, her room is the whole house, where ever she wants to go. The house lets her too, otherwise we would have seen it try to stop her. That's what I thought as well. The movie shows that the magic stems from the grandmother's love and protection for her family, so the magic was failing because she started caring more and more about their gifts and what they could contribute to the town and the name of the family rather than about the individuals themselves. Since she's not gonna be around forever it seems Mirabel was chosen to be her successor and the matriarch of the family, so she wouldn't get the personalized room until it was her time to take over as the source of the magic. This is why aside from each person's magic room (since it's their domain), the house seems to interact with and listen to the commands of the grandma and Mirabel the most. It's why the grandma's mood affects the family's gifts and the house and makes it crumble at the end while the other family members can only suffer the effects without their mood actually contributing to the destruction, and it's why at the end when Mirabel becomes the new source of the magic and brings the house back to life she gets the the candle-holding depiction at the front door (like her grandma's room once had) with her family in the back. I thought it was empathy 
Antonio
Luisa 
Isabella 

She is ver compassionate That's one of the best parts about these films is reading people excited about them after and learning about other cultures and stuff, so fucking awesome. 

Also we may not have magical powers but I am pretty positive my mom has the powers of the mother in the movie because her food really does warm the soul, that shit transcends cultures. Yup! Colombians do that a lot too. EDIT: As well as the gesture Camilo made with his hand after Antonio and the Jaguar began running 😊 It means that things are getting serious lol My roommates were Filipino, but they always did this and even though this is a movie about a completely different culture, it still made me so happy to see just that small thing on screen. 💖 https://youtu.be/XdspxolXeNo one of the animators is Filipino and put his family's mannerisms in the movie Yep and encantos in the Philippines are mythical creatures like elves, dwarfs, and fairies. 

When you try to pee on a tree you have to ask permission from the engkanto that lives there, if you don't it will put a curse you and make your balls swell. I think it's even used on a popular Juanes song...I think La Camisa Negra? So it's the Colombian equivalent of ""Shut the front door!""? We say it in french too, merde (shit) mer-credi Ohh! Aww I love it. Have you been to Argentina? I thought healing moms hair was particularly beautiful.  Idk why but her grey spoke to me If you watch Luisa at the start of her song you'll see baby hairs on her neck. The amount of detail in this movie is crazy. Holy crap, that's a huge budget for an animated film! Had no idea. But I suppose they probably saw it as an investment, good on them. Pixar slaved over the hair for Brave and Disney be running with it. yesss. espeacially when you look at cinderellas rock hair and pochahontas's hair that was literally just a piece of paper with lines. they have really improved the hair graphics I’m way late to this convo, but actively discussing how much this stuff resonated with my own older sister. We’re all pretty successful by most measures, and we all have crippling anxiety issues that we somehow made it to adulthood without ever really sharing. Then 2020 hit me harder than I expected and I just fucking *broke*, and my family was mercifully there to help me pick up the pieces and get the help and support I needed— and we finally talked about the enormous pressure we all felt and put on ourselves all the damn time that we’d somehow never discussed as kids. 

Getting good marks in school is great and something to be proud of! Following someone who got perfect marks in school…. It almost feels like you can’t even succeed— you can just hope to be *as good as* someone else. It’s expected and demanded it you. Accomplishments don’t feel like accomplishments, they feel like requirements where you have to sprint to stay in place. And all of us struggles with it so much, but kept it inside because we never saw the others talking about it, until it was finally too damned much for me to take and we all finally talked about it. It was a *massive* improvement to our relationship, and I felt like this movie captures so many of those emotions. 

I honestly went in not expecting to like it. I put it on because I didn’t feel well this afternoon and wanted to humor my sister who wouldn’t stop talking about it… and it might be my new favorite Disney movie. Like, god damn— Up is good, but this was a decent chunk of one of the most formative bits in my life…. Somehow perfectly encapsulated by a family of Colombian women with magic powers. That's what got me. The absolute heart break in her face as she holds her babies closer. That was the saddest part for me. Her story of how she wanted a different life, one with her love. Yeah that was my point. Mirabel’s mom looks like a full generation above them while Pepa and Bruno look like young 30s. If you look carefully, you can see the silhouette of Bruno vibing to the song in the background during Dolores's verse. Also non stop from Hamilton! My favourite song in the show thank you! you put into words the thing about this movie that i felt was off but couldnt verbalize. even with the whole shouting scene and redemption i felt like the movie never really confronted the grandmother on how she used her family and their gifts as a way to control the town. And the abuse she enflicted on bruno and mirabel just because they couldnt help feed her ego. i understand that generational trauma is a thing but that doesnt mean what she has done is light enough to be brushed off with a ""sorry wont do it again"" Except this family creates the equivalent of a US 21st century upper middle class lifestyle, for every member of this mid 20th century Columbian town.

Of course they built them a new home. When their power returns each villager regains their high quality of life.

The villagers get free healthcare money couldn’t buy. Broken arm? Fixed. One lady just needs to spend her days in the kitchen making magic food for you and you are all healthy forever.

The villager get free labor equal to an entire construction crew and day laborers. Need livestock rounded up? A building wall fixed? A whole building moved? The granddaughter will do it for the equivalent of some shared food, while singing a song about how she works all day without a break doing any and all labor requested.

The town has physical security from outsiders from the magic. They’ll never suffer from a drought because of the magic.

You wished you lived this good with this much security. Norwegians are jealous. I did think Dolores would be useful if anyone ever went missing, like a lost animal or child but helping the elderly is something I did not consider and I like the idea of it!

In the end though, the true significance of Dolores' gift is that it helped her connect with Mr. Mariano. If not for her hearing, she would have never have heard all the things that made her fall in love with him, like his poetry etc. I've felt the quality of the Disney songs has declined in recent years anyway, it's not exclusive to Encanto. I really like Moana and Frozen but at times the lyrics are really basic in comparison to Mulan, Pocahontas, The Lion King etc. Luisa’s feelings are never explored or really shown outside the song. Even the song’s visuals muddy the moment. Why is she doing all this free-moving tiktok dancing while singing about being trapped by expectations? Why are donkeys comedically the backup dancers? as the light-skinned sister with “the pretty one” being my dark-skinned indigenous looking sister… tbh as soon as i saw her relationship with mirabel i cried 😂 He's specifically throwing salt over his left shoulder, which is supposed to prevent bad luck. i mean as someone who has ocd it’s also not not ocd-like to act on those compulsions. there’s pure O cases but the C is also important and distressing, and the frequency with which he felt he had to knock on wood or jump over a crack rang really true to me. and i think adherence to superstition often comes a lot from intrusive thought patterns I like it that at the end, she and her husband are laughing and dancing in a little rainstorm and she’s actually enjoying her constant cloud. Edit: perhaps I should be more clear this comparison is purely based off the rest of the soundtrack. In case it isn’t obvious I don’t listen to Colombian music. My gripe is the instrumental music gave off a far different vibe than the musical bits. 

That was my biggest issue with this movie. It had a great setting and story but I felt like every time a song started I was pulled out of it. It just didn’t fit the style for me and really felt like the musical songs were almost clashing with the rest of the instrumental soundtrack that fit the Columbian environment. They weren’t bad songs by any measure, they just seemed like they belonged in a different movie. 

>!The song with the strong character Louisa was particularly out of place for me. What was with that modern pop style that came out of nowhere? Felt like a weird tone shift even within the same song!< Aw, I really liked We Don’t Talk About Bruno. I completely agree. It's like why of all the MCU scores, Black Panther's stands out so much. It's so great when a score or when musical numbers have the culture they're representing ingrained into them. Dude gets hired to write the music for these films. It’s not like he shoehorns his way into these productions. Disney wants LMM so they hire him to write the songs. Tick Tick Boom was just that

I believe its because we see his face too much

Honestly on paper there should be nothing wrong, but when someone get too succesfull to quickly people begin to turn on them. Most writers exist behind a closed door and audiences know the name but not the face, but lin has put himself in the spotlight Hamilton was niche when he first started it. No one thought about doing something like that until LMM came along. Just because he turner something niche into a huge success is not something I'd slight him for. He wants that EGOT Yeah this is a bizarre take for me. Like take everyone favorite artist - their songs might be different but still have their touch on them. 

Same with LMM and the guy is *good* at what he does. Im totally fine with being able to tell it’s his work. Yeah, and Zootopia pulled off something similar, too. It can be done and beautifully. But lately things feel so scattershot and unfinished. I agree, I thought Frozen 1 was a bit of a mess clearly reworked late in production, leading to all sorts of character arc issues with Hans, but I loved the teasers and trailers for Frozen 2 (still near the top for what I think the best teasers of all time are, the storytelling of Elsa trying to cross the ocean was just phenomenal). When I saw the film I was shocked at how unformed it felt. Hunchback of Notre Dame was also very violent. Even in the first scenes, >!Frollo throws and kills Quasimodo's mother on the church's steps, and almost threw the baby into a well. He also later sets a house on fire.!< even emotionally, like during the flashback of abuela's husband dying later in the film, they didn't show him getting killed but the setup of them with the machetes and her falling to the ground crying was so powerful Yeah. I thought the ""magical"" hacienda that dominates the countryside (and makes the townspeople dependent on their gifts) had an unfortunate similarity to land consolidation post La Violencia.  (Not Colombian, but heard countless stories from Colombian colleagues who had fled to NYC post La Violencia.) Colombia was sadly afflicted by civil war far before the drug war. This happened in 1953, during a period known as la Violencia. It's basically been like that since the 1940s until the 1990s; some would argue it never really stopped. That's how I feel. Mirabel's gift was becoming the new head of the family. She had to prove herself to the magic just like abuela did Isabela was made like the typical colombian girl with the long long hair  😂 I saw it that Abuela's gift was Encanto itself. During the second flashback I saw that the candle seemed to be reacting Abuela's intense wish to keep her family and community safe, thus creating the mountains and the Encanto valley. Then Mirabel gift was similar in her deep love for her family and her ability to keep everyone together and growing, thus her magic flowing into the new house that everyone built together. Abuela described the initial enchantment as something along the lines of being borne out of her “anguish.” Mirabel first sees the cracks right after/while she was feeling ostracized from her family after the group picture at the party for her little cousin. She absolutely has the same “gift” as her abuela.

Edit: autocorrect and clarity. I got the gooooldennnn tiiickkketttt Also Namaari is the actual worst. I think it's because we're forgetting the two audiences they gotta play to here. Yes the song is emotional as hell for somebody who's shouldering an intense burden for their loved ones and the expectation that they can do it all without fail. Most adults can relate to that and feel emotion.

Young kids and sheltered teenagers really aren't going to connect to that until later in life but they can start hearing that message (they don't have to shoulder it alone) now because they can appreciate the humour in the visuals I’m so late here but I actually loved the visuals in surface pressure because they show how overwhelmed Luisa always felt and how as soon as she felt in control she would get more dumped on her plate and thrown at her. I thought it went perfectly with the music. Who said the music was bad? Alpha said they like Lin Manuel Miranda's other works more. I said other aspects of the film were even stronger than the music. Neither of us said the songs were bad, they're just not our favorites. It could have possibly just been for the sake of the joke (ie. the Genie making plenty of cultural references that don’t fit in their “world”) Maybe he saw telenovelas in his future visions Yeah, Dolores' power really felt like it was just there to move the plot forward so we would have a reason why the dinner would go haywire. Not gonna lie, I got teary eyed during that short because it said so much without a single word. I'm a father with a fucked up childhood and the message that you don't have to pass on your traumas really hit me deep. Also to explain to kids instead of just telling them to do it I'm looking forward to the next Disney Animation movie. None of the industry insiders have spoiled your upcoming movie so I'm excited to learn what you and your colleagues have been working on. :) I just went to see it in 2D but your comment has made me want to go back and see it again in 3D! The effects were absolutely beautiful, the lighting around the candle in particular was incredible. And Mirabel’s hair! Agree! I kind of wish they just… hadn’t gotten their gifts back since it kind of ran counter to the whole message that the gifts didn’t matter after all. I thought that as well but 

1) It'd be kind of weird to introduce the idea that Isabela can use her powers to make things other than flowers and then be like ""Nevermind, can't do that anymore.""

2) It still works when you assume the family will no longer view the powers as something that have to be useful in furthering the family's status and more like just quirks they have that just a part of them that they aren't obligated to use in any particular way. I actually really like his Moana songs but these songs had a bit too much of him for my taste. Sucks because as a Colombian I was expecting a bit more from the movie overall. :( I couldn't even understand what was being sung in some parts, I was like huh? Looking at my family Not that unpopular.  Lots of people feel the same way.  I didn't care for him in his Hamilton days, but liked him more after Moana.  I don't revere him or anything, but like him well enough now. It's gaslighting her granddaughter and calling her a drunk in front of the entire town. That's her power. I told you her power! 😂 As I interpreted it... The old hag didn't get a gift, cause her job was helping everyone else feel united and motivated. But since she was doing a shitty job, the house chose Mirabel as a replacement, that's why she didn't get a gift herself. No, or rather her power was to build the house. That’s why there’s so much resonance when Mirabel’s power ends up being to rebuild the house Abuela destroyed. Everything is good at home? Yea - but this is a man that felt so rejected by his family he pretended to run away and instead lived in the walls of his family home ((that is alive and can feel and talk but doesn’t say anything to anyone that Bruno is in the walls??? or the cousin that can hear everything and doesn’t hear him sad in the walls?)) 

and instead he watches his family eat, be together and celebrate birthdays through different cracks in the home. 

i think bruno takes the cake Yes, but we regularly perform choreographed musical numbers about how we don't talk about Bruno. Yeah but I feel like that really goes to show how ostracized Bruno had been in the family leading up to his disappearance. After he left the family basically pretended he didn't exist and only talked about the bad things he did (most of which weren't even his fault). > and I wondered why no one went to Antonio to ask the rats, ""homies whats going on here?""

He literally JUST got his powers tho and was having more fun being in his room where he can't be bothered to help solve the mystery It is. You can tell by his glowing eyes. Bruno's eyes only glow when he's using his gift, whereas Camilo in Bruno-form always has glowing eyes. Yeah, during the second verse you see his shadow on the second floor moving. Then when she leans in and asks “do you understand?” you see him vibing with the beat and his arms above his head I think that was her just trying to cover herself. She probably thought she was going nuts hearing the rats talking. Notice the use of present tense when she says ""I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling."" The whole verse is past tense except that line. She can hear him.

She even sings ""It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him now"" later in the song.

I can only speculate as to why she chose to keep the fact that Bruno still lived in the house to herself. Maybe she thought it was best for the family if they didn't know. I think the grandmother insisted on people staying in the nursery until they were old enough to get their gift. I knew from the outset with a plot like this the film would either end with Mirabel getting a gift or learning to be happy with the symbolic gift she would discover over the course of the film.

What I was surprised at was that the family all gained their gifts back at the end.

I figured Mirabel's gift was actually the power to change given the butterflies on her dress and the candle. She has the power to both restore magic and take it away. Should also mention that we saw what happened when Bruno stopped using his gift. Door shut down and his room went to pot.

If Abuela's gift was keeping the family together and the magic going, well she stopped using it and the cracks make sense. Oh yeah!! That's one good example of that. Shit...taki mushrooms Coco actually does the same thing! At one point, Miguel says ""no manches"", which is a censoring of ""no mames"" Honestly, Shrek made huge leaps with animating hair/fur. So did Monster's Inc. It just keeps getting better and better, for sure. It doesn't really seem fair to compare hand drawn stuff to CG though.  The hours required to hand animate realistic hair would be off the charts. Bruno does have gray in his hair though, compare with the flashback where Abuela asks him to look at Mirabel's future - his hair is fully black there. It was a decade in between. She also straight up sings ""I can hear him now"" at one point A much better ending would have been for the town to rebuild the house, but they all live on looking out for each other without magic. While I like the song, I also feel the lyrics don't seem to represent the song's message of family expectations. She never explains how the family leans on her or asks her for help. She clearly isn't taking on an emotional burden. She's not the breadwinner. She's not being shown as holding the family together emotionally. Her song should be about how she feels unappreciated and like a physical work animal. But instead it's about how she holds all the families burdens. But she doesn't! The family is super happy! The house is super big and free! Everyone is smiling and getting along! The town loves them! She has never shown any cracks before that scene. You gotta foreshadow stuff. 

It's an island. Her appearances for the rest of the movie follow it, though I feel her complete emotional breakdown is also the opposite of the song, but at least they're not ignoring it. it wasnt pop exactly, he picked different genres on columbian sound in each song, you just may not be familar with them all so they seem out of place I agree, some of the songs were a bit jarring and I felt pulled out of the movie. Particularly the one you mentioned. 
I like the songs though, I've been listening to the soundtrack on repeat. And that same song is quickly becoming a favorite. Outside the context of the movie/scene I like it better. I totally agree with you on this, but I believe the Black Panther score was composed by white Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson. That was old Disney though, and Hunchback did so poorly that they didn't step out of ""family friendly"" for at least a decade after. We've literaly never had a year of peace since the conception of Colombia. 

Even Syria has had times of peace! I saw it not as the same gift, but a kind of parallel.

Where Abeula's gift was putting up walls, hence the mountain after Pedro's sacrifice, Mirabel's was tearing them down, signified by the very same mountain being torn in two following their fight. Also, since Bruno can see into the future, it makes sense for him to make those jokes. I imagine Bruno using his powers in the future just to find out what happens next in telenovelas. The main thing that pops out to me when I compare Moana and Encanto's soundtracks are the differing orchestrations. Moana had a very lush, choral sound that gave me nostalgic vibes of 90s Disney movies, whereas Encanto definitely feels like LMM got more leeway to draw more from modern pop and Broadway shows that use smaller orchestras and more electronic influences. As someone who has no clue how to truly judge the quality of music, I'm unsure which is truly ""better"", and if you stripped all the songs down from both movies to lyrics and piano backing tracks I'd probably be able to compare them more easily. Still, I'm biased, as Moana is probably my personal favorite Disney soundtrack of the last decade because the sound of it (both the musical numbers with lyrics and the background score) took me straight back to watching Disney movies in my childhood. What’s even more obnoxious is she accuses Mirabel of being a confused drunk then later that night acknowledges that she knew Mirabel was telling the truth! Of course!! She’s just like my crazy Colombian Grandmother, who is the low key villain in our family too! Hahahaha touché You learn to live with it. It took the same realization as in the movie to understand my mother. My mother grew up as an orphan because both her parents were killed in La Violencia. My father left his home at a young age to work. Many of my friends grew up under similar situations where family was taken from them.

One of the most beautiful moments was seeing the pueblito coming together to help. Colombians love each other anywhere we are. The cousin said she knew all along and didn’t say anything Yeah plus he’s a 5 year old kid! I think that's meant to be Camilo in his Bruno form. Damn, good eyes. I mean if she can recognise the sound of an eye twitching and know whose eye it is I think she can recognise her uncle's voice. I figure she did it for Bruno's sake. Maybe she thought he would leave for real if she revealed he was still there. I love how literally every word from Dolores’ mouth is foreshadowing. I almost think she sent Mirabel to Luisa specifically to bring Bruno out of hiding. 😂 Oh absolutely; the cruelty is the point.

I get that that's the heavy implication as one would get their own space if they had a gift, and in the case of Mirabel they've never had to think of asking Casita for a workaround, so leaving her in the nursery is a convenient ""make-do"".

But it's still fucked to keep infantilising Mirabel in this really insulting way. Would Mirabel be asked to share the room with Isabella and Mariano's firstborn (had that gone to plan) when it became a toddler? I loved Encanto.   I knew right away that Disney with this movie was introducing the audience to the beauty of Gabriel García Márquez' magic realism,  like in his masterpiece One Hundred Years of Solitude.  The mariposas amarillas (yellow butterflies) were definitely a nod to García Márquez.  'One Hundred Years' is a tough book to read but please do yourself a favor and read it if you can.  The New York Times considered One Hundred Years of Solitude a must read for the entire human race.   I'm South American,  not Colombian, but Encanto touched my heart deeply. Yep I remember watching all the special features on Monsters Inc. showing how tricky the fur simulations were and how much work they did to get it right.

Seeing that sort of stuff is always so cool b/c you know you're about to see that technology used a lot more in other content as we continue to grow with other technological and creative leaps. Always happy to learn something new, especially about music. Any recommendations of Colombian music to check out? I don't think it was necessarily that Hunchback did poorly which made them exclude violence from future films. A large part of it was the developing standards and concerns around film violence to children methinks Yea, I don’t have much of an ear for music but Moana felt very classic and iconic to me from my first viewing, whereas everything here felt very dated to late 00’s/early 10’s era. The Luisa song was particular bad at this. I’m also baffled by this considering most people are assuming Mirabel is only 15… drunk 15 year old is better then 15 year old seeing cracks? I thought the comment wasn’t referring to Mirabel but as a way of light up the mood. Kinda as a way of inviting everyone to try the drinks or saying they were good that sort of thing. Crazy how similar this sounds to the movie. Sorry for what ur family has gone thru :( What did you think of the movie tho? It's right next to where his hidden entrance to the walls is though. Not if that uncle was given the gift of acting I think what frustrates me is how much this movie could have used an after credit scene showing off Mirabel's new room. Like, just a normal, airy, bright room, with a big comfy bed  to contrast that small and kind of dark nursery with little cots. Aside from Shakira Who should have been in this movie

Vicente Fernández

Cumbia sound in general really Well I'm not sure about all latin cultures but in Mexican culture it's not unusual for under age kids to drink alcohol but seeing things is definitely not considered a good sign. So yeah a drunk 15 year would probably be better. Yes!!! Not that she was a drunk!! She said let’s continue this party with strong drinks !!! Not that she was a drunk! Lol y’all twisting things. It's not that different for many Colombians. I emigrated to the U.S. to find a better life.

Thanks for the kind words.

I really enjoyed it. It wasn't pandering, it reflected the importance of family, and it didn't get anything too wrong. But his eyes are glowing. Bruno's eyes only glow when he's using his gift, but when Camilo assumes his shape, his eyes are always glowing. It's definitely Camilo. This is the perfect response, and got a giggle out of me. She probably thought there were 3 rats in the walls, and only knew the names of Hernando and Jorge lmao I'm satisfied with the implication another commenter pointed out - with Mirabel now on the front door, the whole house *is* her room.

But you never know? Disney may release a short titled Mirabel's New Room or maybe when Abeula passes, Mirabel will inherit her room? I imagine when Dolores has kids, her room will just adapt to accommodate them and the nursery will be passed onto them as they get older and then Mirabel moves into Abeula's? Vicente Fernàndez is not Colombian lmao. Chente is very famously Mexican (he dresses like a mariachi). Kinda odd to see you bring him up as an example of Colombian music when Juanes is pretty much the second most famous Colombian musician of the modern era. Saying Vicente Fernández is Colombian is like saying idk, Captain America is Canadian. Interesting. I saw it on Spanish (in Mexico) and I don’t remember any mention about her being drunk. Y’know what would be sweet? If they don’t do a sequel, just a short showing a bunch of young kids and a few young couples running around in the house, preparing for a birthday which gets revealed to be for Abuela

And then it pans over a packed table of family, a huge birthday cake and then Abuela, who is Mirabel. I interpreted the story as Mirabel being passed the torch, Abuela was the current Matriarch however she lost sight of why she was given the candle of miracles (her family) and so Mirabel will be given that role in her stead.

See Abuela is the head of the family, this is symbolized as her being the ""candle-holder"". Mirabel is the same, no powers of her own but has the capacity to keep her family together. Her being the key to restoring the casa is just evident on how the magical forces there is setting her up as the next family head. I need shorts of everyone opening their doors and finding out their powers for the first time Abuela mentions to the guests that the drinks are “stronger” when Mirabel says that there were cracks. Well yeah, I don't think anyone's on the opposite side of that argument considering the candle has a butterfly design on it just like Mirabel's outfit has a butterfly motif and then when the two reconcile, butterflies surround them.

Change is a thing Mirabel is desperate for herself (""All I need is a chance, all I need is to change"") and it's what she ends up bringing to all the characters around her and in doing so, brings unto herself. Mirabel's role in the family is to succeed her grandmother and rebuilding Casita from the ground up is part of that symbolic procession, just as Abeula built the first home. I feel sorry for Dolores. There is never a time where super hearing is good. Poor girl has to cower and cover her ears at the fireworks. Can you imagine growing up normal and the sudden shock of having super hearing for the rest of your life? 

She heard everyone at night. Her uncle living in the walls. Her crush living who knows how far away, down in the village muttering poetry to himself until her got that right... multiplied by an entire village. Out of all the Madrigals, she's the one I wonder how she managed to stay sane in all of this.  
Also, I really want to know what her room looks like. ",0
135,"Mac’s mom is being type cast  I found the ending as a parallel to what Mildred was saying to the Priest earlier in the movie.

That even though he didn't rape her daughter, and he wasn't even in the same country, he is still culpable because he is in the same group of people who would do that sort of thing.

Just something I thought was interesting. Woody Harrelson's character was fantastic.  I like that it wasn't a black v. white conflict between his character and McDormand's character.  The letter he left her was hilarious.  I liked how McDormand's character was illogical and flawed. 
 Dinklage deserved more screen time.  Sam Rockwell was great as ever. ""She said *'begets'*?"" 

My theater was dying, so good.  This is my favorite movie from this year.  The part where Mildred screams Robbie's name when he's trying to stop her from putting out the fires is heartbreaking. 1. The blood splattering on Mildred's face was such an effective bit of tonal whiplash. I love how it takes both the audience and her aback for just a couple seconds and literally wipes the smile off her face; it's a shocking moment, a brilliantly performed moment by both actors. 

2. Well that makes it two amazing  performances as redneck racist cops this year, but who'd have thunk one could grow to sympathize with such a character. Rockwell and McDormand give career-bests here.

3. Haven't heard much talk about Carter Burwell's score around but I'd actually say this is his best collaboration with McDonagh yet, particularly love the track that plays over Harrelson's final moments.

4. Nice to see Željko Ivanek not as the butt monkey this time, but instead one of the more competent of the police officers.

EDIT Typo I think my favorite character was Red. He didn't ask for any of this trouble and was just trying to do his job. But even after all that, he still makes sure that the straw is facing the right way in the orange juice he poured for his attacker. Can we talk about that fire scene? I thought it was perfect. The emotional weight of Dixon reading Willoughby's final words to him, contrasted with the molotov cocktails all while the music is playing made me laugh my fucking ass off. Best scene in the movie IMO.


Also that tracking shot was awesome, also got a lot of laughs.


Anyone think that Dixon might have been gay? His tendencies to get really close to people, his aggressiveness and almost obsession with the billboard guy, and his remark to his mom about not having a nice lady.  Funniest moment for me... ""Isn't that racist?""

&nbsp;

Also, while Kenneth Branagh wins for Best Lead Mustache for MotOE... Peter Dinklage should most assuredly win for Best Supporting Mustache for this film.  A lot of really great writing in this movie:

-  The three billboards / the three letters

- The fact that Willoughby is a weirdly good writer then Dixon explains that you need to be good at English to be a cop

-  The wine bottle as a weapon fake-out, a great reference to In Bruges


This movie had a ton of cool layers on top of being gripping and very funny.  I enjoyed it.  The sheriff paying the last month for the billboards to fuck with Mildred was the best.

Also, I loved Peter Dinklage in this, and that date was heartbreaking. How are not just talking about that wonderful bunny slipper crucifixion scene? The scene where Dixon attacks the billboard company might be my new favorite scene of the year. Such a great depiction of grief on film, and a microcosm of the whole film. Unhealthy grieving at its most unhealthy. The beautiful song, the unbroken shot, Sam Rockwell trying his hardest not be charming, Caleb Landry Jones taking the on-screen beating of a lifetime, and even some of the little comedic beats. It's all so wonderful. It's amazing how McDonaugh manages to get you to sympathize with both the attacker and the victim in this scene, I loved it.  I really wish this had ended with the *What a coincidence I'm headed to Idaho in the morning* phone call. The most emotional scene of the movie and probably the year for me was Woody Harrelson's last scene... Fucking Wow.  Samara Weaving as Mildred's Ex-Husbands Girlfriend absolutely slayed me and the entire theatre. Can we please talk about the CGI deer. I saw it last week and enjoyed it tremendously. I think it is the best thing McDonagh has done at this point in his career. Even as a viewer well-acquainted with (and appreciative of) his majestically dark sense of humor, I found myself rocked by how bleak ""Three Billboards"" could be, at certain times.

It is worth mentioning that, for me, one of the most tragic moments in the film was the revelation that the billboards were in view of Mildred's house. Since we know that Angela was raped and murdered at the billboards (as evidenced by the scorch marks on the ground), this means that—even as she was enduring all of that fear, pain and suffering—she could see her home. As a viewer, you have to wonder if she was, in her final moments, praying that her mother or brother might see her and be able to provide help... or even just be there to hold her hand as she lay dying.

And the fact that this aspect of the crime is never directly remarked upon by any character (as far as I can recall... I did have to take a bathroom break) speaks to McDonagh's respect for the viewer. What was going on with Abbie Cornish's floating accent? My favorite scene was easily the ""one shot throwing red out a window"" sequence. It really defined Rockwell's character. Just saw it and love the way it makes you think about everything when it’s over. Bottom line though, at least to me, is that we (the audience) are meant to feel exactly as Mildred felt; Empty and longing for answers. We don’t get a nice gift-wrapped conclusion where everything is resolved and makes us feel better. But then, neither does she. I don’t understand the rationale of including the gift shop scene. When the guy brags in the bar, he knows about Angela’s death. He’s still in Ebbing! Why is he bragging about raping and killing a different girl? Why the need for the gift shop to set up the twist? It’s a twist even without that scene and now we just have this odd unnecessary context that raises more questions than it answers. 

Are we to believe that he’s a random sadistic murderer passing through Ebbing, pretending he’s Angela’s killer to get a rise from Mildred, and getting off to bragging about raping/killing a different girl in a bar later? There’s just so many hoops to jump through to get an explanation for the gift shop scene.  I just didn't understand what the point of this movie was or what it was trying to say. It felt completely aimless and tonally non-nonsensical. I really enjoyed Sam Rockwell's performance, but that's about it. I didn't understand any motivations of the characters and the whole movie just felt like actors acting. I didn't hate it, but I definitely missed the point of the movie if there was one. Please feel free to help explain to me what you got out of it.  Wondering why I'm not seeing more about one of the most important themes in the film - the fact that the suspect/soldier/rapist is ironic and symbolic. 

Essentially, he is a rapist and murderer. He raped and murdered a girl in Iraq or Afghanistan. He lives amongst us with impunity and gets away with it bc of the blind eye we turn to such things for people who mean little to us here, and who are marginalized. That man, the way he rubbed her daughter's death in her face, was indicative of the kind of scum that he was, and the brazen way such people walk amongst us. 

The fact that the characters in this film were able to evolve and change, not always through direct salvation or attainment of their actual goal (we never find Angie's killer, the dwarf never gets to fall in love, Dixon doesn't become a detective), but find it in other ways (The chief leaves earth on his own terms, Angie's mom for once wishes her ex well rather than giving him the angry reaction he wants, Dixon finds a true suspect through different means), and this keeps up with said theme. We never find Angie's killer. But there is a chance at identifying and possibly bringing to ""justice"" another rapist/murderer of young girls. 

To me, this all sums up the fact that despite life's chaotic, and often unfulfilling circumstances, we can find salvation and the universal attainment of progress in indirect, human ways amidst the random unrest. 

Anyway, so much more to discuss and so many great themes everyone is touching on...but just wanted to bring forth that particular aspect of the film, where I feel something important was being alluded to, much like police brutality issues, racism, and other things in the film. . McDormand better get an Oscar nomination at least.

Edit: Oh shit. She won. A lot has been made about how in the past female characters needed to be likeable to be sympathetic.  This movie destroys that notion.  Mildred is a complete jerk to practically everyone she meets, and yet never lost my sympathy.  I also liked how the flashback showed that she wasn't much different before her daughter died.  The act of dying or losing someone close to you does not redeem you as a person, and this film showed that in many ways.

The only unfortunate thing is while I could imagine many actors in the roles of Dixon or Willoughby, it is hard to think of many actresses who could play Mildred.  Hopefully Hollywood gets more diverse and starts writing better roles for women.  Having more female protagonists is one thing, we also need a lot more female anti heroes.  When I watched this film my impression of the ending was that the guy in the bar did actually do it but Abercrombie (the new chief) was covering for him after talking to the CO. This makes sense in the context and theme of the movie. The new chief is basically a corrupt politician.

Why would the rapist have visited Mildred if he was not connected in some way? Are we supposed to believe that he was just a guy who was passing through and knew all about the situation and the billboards?

Why did Abercrombie's story to Dixon have to include details about the CO who said the alleged rapist was out of the country? Why didn't Abercrombie just say that the DNA wasn't a match and leave it at that?

Also the way that Abercrombie told Dixon that ""he did good"" when getting the DNA from a bar fight seemed very odd. Look at it from the Chief's point of view, Dixon, who is a disgraced cop and a known drunk was involved in a bar fight and makes all these claims... then the DNA comes back negative. The chief would assume that Dixon is full of shit and wasting everybody's time, he would not be praising him. It seemed like the chief was just placating him so he wouldn't look into it further. I can't decide what the funniest moment of this movie was there were so many fantastic moments... I might have to go with Mildred's rant about the Gangs to the Priest. I was dying That moment in the flashback when Mildred tells Angela ""I hope you get raped too"" hit me like a brick to the gut. Wonderfully dark storytelling and editing throughout. One hell of an arc Sam Rockwell’s character got. He deserves an Oscar just as much as McDormand.  I was completely shocked while in the interrogation room goes from debate to cough in the face and the immediate care for one another it was just a big slap and just a mixture of emotions great film man It’s so weird seeing Mac’s mom show any emotion for once Seems like no one is mentioning the fact that Mildred had a fire extinguisher in the car *because* Angela burned to death, it wasn't because she suspected someone would burn the billboards. Angela was killed just a few hundred feet from her home. Maybe Mildred found Angela's body, or maybe she got to Angela while she was still burning but couldn't put the fire out. Who knows? If something like that happens in your ""backyard"" you'd probably become a little paranoid and take precautions to make sure it doesn't happen again. Great film. Very sad. Rockwell was the pick of the lot for me. Also, I like the way Abbie Cornish says 'cock' I posted this in another thread but I'll post it again:

You know, I really wanted to love Three Billboards, but while I still thought it was a good movie, it was just missing something that kept it from being great IMO. While McDormand, Harrelson, and Rockwell were all incredibly spectacular, there was an odd disconnect with the rest of the cast. 

For me it was the bizarre routes the film took that left me feeling like it could've been so much better. Things like the out-of-place ex-husband's girlfriend, Chief Willoughby's wife's confusing accent, the existence of the gift shop scene, how on-the-nose the scene when Rockwell overhears the alleged rapist was, and of course the weird CGI deer that ruined what would've been a great scene.

Was it a bad movie? Not by any means. In fact, I really loved most of it. *In Bruges* being one of my favorite films though, I didn't think this movie quite lived up to it. This is the most Coen Brothers movie ever to not be directed by the Coen Brothers. This was so close to being a full on ten for me but the one thing I don't really agree with on this one is the one scene with the rapist in the gift shop. How was he linked to Willoughby? What was the point of the scene at all? That final scene with Woody ripped my fucking heart out.  Been waiting for this!
I cannot gush about this film enough, as I've already seen it twice. It managed to find the perfect balance of switching between making me laugh and making me cry between the scenes. Most noticeable example: THAT scene followed by Sam Rockwell dancing to ABBA. Because that's just how life goes. No big emotional send off, just life going on. Not to mention that Sam Rockwell has one of the best character arcs that I've seen in a long time. I just loved how everyone was just in this morally gray area (except for maybe Woody Harrelson's character who I initially thought was going to be a total dick.) 

But my absolute favorite scene: Mildred falling to her knees as she tries to put out the fires. It felt very Sisphyian but it solidified what her ex had told her earlier in the film how the billboards wouldn't bring back her daughter. The way her son tries to stop her but the anguish that Frances Mcdormand conveys when she yells at him was utterly heartbreaking. I really hope she at least gets an Oscar Nom. Movie is pretty fucking amazing. Endlessly quotable with very strong characters. Frances and Sam Rockwell really knocked it out of the park. Can't wait to see it again. 
 Newbie here. First post. Loved the movie and the interesting discussion here. Insightful comments for the most part.

One thing I don't think has been mentioned is that McDonagh uses the Shakespeare device of having the ""fool"" reveal the underlying truth of the story, when the ditzy 19-year-old girlfriend says, ""Anger only begets more anger"".  That's it in a nutshell.

And BTW, Abbie Cornish's accent IS all over the place. It gets progressively more Australian through the course of the movie. In her last scene, when she gives Mildred the letter, she's full-on Aussie. Wow, I really came into this to have some fun with people talking about some of the movie scenes. Really wasn´t expecting the hate, I thought this movie was incredible.
Everyone I know that has seen it absolutely loved it and had no doubt it will win every award this year. The actors were also incredible - for me, personally Sam Rockwell was the best one. 
I wonder if this movie is being a bit better received in Europe then in the US. It is a british production and the humor, I feel, is very british/scandinavian. Everyone keeps mentioning that the accents were off, but of course, not having english as a mother tongue I couldnt tell, and it didnt bother me at all. 
For everyone saying it is not realistic, and something´s are off...have you seen the director´s other movies? I don´t think he is into realism. Even In Bruge, which has the most normal plot, felt a bit like fantasy land.  Rockwell had such an amazing arc. I went from hating him to easily rooting for him in a heartbeat. He stole the show and I’m not surprised. 

Also really enjoyed the open ending.  [deleted] Now I know in the future to avoid this subreddit after I see a movie that I really enjoyed. I absolutely love dark dramas like this. I liked how the theme of this movie is forgiveness: And damn, I was caught off guard by William's letter to Mildred. What a great twist. 

I hope Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand wins the categories they are nominated in. they deserve it. Very powerful performance. really enjoyed the twists - I felt myself inch to the edge of my seat a few times. Although we have a few protagonists in the movie, no one is really a good person - they come off as just people, effected by parts of their lives we don't get to see outside of a few references. this way of making the characters really brought them to life for me. During that last phone call between Mildred and Dixon, I must've changed my mind about what was going to happen about 12 times. I was adamant that Dixon would tell Mildred he committed the murder and then shoot himself to give Mildred some form of comfort.

Outstanding movie What a film. I love the use of fire throughout the film.

1. Mildred's daughter was burned.
2. Dixon going through the fire.
3. The billboards burning.

There's a change everytime there's something on fire. I also didn't expect Dixon changing from a racist cop to a  vigilante. In fact both Mildred and Dixon changing from anger-fueled decision makers to purpose driven vigilantes made it a satisfying ride. That tracking shot specifically is the most exciting thing ever.  I saw “Three Billboards” at a festival awhile ago, before it was released and before it was a huge award contender with a trail of controversies behind it. From what I’ve been following on that, I personally didn’t feel the film is condescending or sympathetic with a racist character - in fact, one of its main points of the script is how those people are products of their upbringing and circumstance, but that everyone can evolve and grow and eventually do the right thing (even when the “right thing” is on a gray area and involves tough moral choices). But the movie has an abrupt ending that didn’t sit so well with me - it finishes before that tough choice is made, as if the director avoided to push the story to its limits. Though I’m glad Martin McDonagh is expanding his fanbase and getting recognised by its talent, I wonder if people who enjoyed “Three Billboards” ever saw “In Bruges” (one of his early works and a film that is close to perfect in my book). If you haven’t, you should check it out. That was a movie that, IMO, went to the extremes and never looked back.

I must also praise the cast. Rockwell is my personal MVP, and considering the quality of Frances McDormand’s work, that’s saying something. As far as McDormand go, I always liked her as an actress, even though I feel she is one of those big personas who absorb their peculiar traits and mannerisms into their performances. But she can be a powerhouse when she finds a character who fits her style, like it happens here. I’m glad they got their Oscars. It was enjoyable to watch but the movie felt more like a collection of related scenes than a fully functioning movie. Harrelson was great. They needed someone to tell them their accents were abysmal.  I thought the movie was INCREDIBLE. One of the best I've seen in years. Sam Rockwell plays the character of Reddit. The only real question I'm stuck with is why the hell that soldier showed up in her gift store. 

I understand the purpose he ultimately served but am at a complete loss as to what he was doing in the gift store scene. Maybe it's because I was a bit drunk.  Enjoyed the film, thought Woody was great, but I can't believe how awful Abbie Cornish was.  

I don't think it was entirely her fault, the character seemed utterly out of place, but her performance didn't really help. The scene in which Dixon throws Red out the window will go down as one of my personal favourite scenes from the last few years. The music, cinematography and performances all came together perfectly  Frances McDormand reminds me of Willem Dafoe I think what made this movie so striking were the moments when the characters showed genuine compassion or forgiveness for each other, because you were expecting them to do the opposite. Several times you have already made up your mind about a character and then they go and show some humanity and make you question your assumptions. And then it ends, still in the cycle of anger begetting more anger and it makes you think the juxtaposition will go on forever. Red was my favourite character. Caleb Landry Jones is always good, but had such a fantastic 2017 it kind of blows my mind. Am I the only one who laughed in a lot of scenes? I feel guilty because this is not a comedy movie, its drama/crime right? I commented about this movie a few weeks ago on a ""best film you watched this week"" thread and decided to expand upon it here.

I think this movie perfectly encapsulates what a film should be, in structure and characterization. In Bruges is, IMO, one of the best black comedies ever, and while it still ranks very high on my list, I think *Three Billboards* is better as a complete work. No line of dialogue is wasted, and everything ties together - not neatly by any means, but satisfyingly.

Frances McDormand is perfect in this role (no surprise because it was written for her); she's so fucking sharp every single moment. Even at Mildred Hayes's most vulnerable, she doesn't lose her edge. But Sam Rockwell is honestly such a knockout too. His character goes through the most growth, and he plays it so believably. And the rest of the cast compliments these two characters amazingly.

*Three Billboards* proves that McDonagh is one of the best screenwriters working right now, and I just love the fact that he is able to weave these minor characters in and give them purpose too. One of my favorite moments is when Willoughby writes in his letter about finding out about the rapist-murderer by chance in a bar ""five years later"" and then Dixon overhears exactly that. Even though it's not the same guy, I thought that detail was just a fantastic example of foreshadowing in a film; it also falls perfectly in line with McDonagh's ironic sense of humor. I just love this movie so much, and I hope more people get to see it. I thought the movie was pretty fantastic. Loved the black comedy injected to it just what I expected from the same director of In Bruges. The only thing I found kinda odd was Woody's character killing himself so close to his home. He was so considerate with everything following his suicide like leaving suicide notes and also wearing a bag over his head with a note written on it, but he should've known killing himself so close to his home would make living at that place unbearable for his family. Other than that and the deer I really enjoyed the movie. Hey all! So the creator of YouPoll who created our new polling system had an interesting idea for a new feature. We wanted to get your thoughts on it. Here is what he said:

>We are trying to see if there is interest for an interactive r/movies table. The table would pull info from each r/movies official movie discussion poll. The table would show each movie's name, average score, standard deviation (how polarizing the movie is) and total votes, similar to the [IMDb Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=tt_awd). You would also be able to sort the table by these metrics. Movies would be added to the table with each new official movie discussion post. Finally, multiple tables could be created to show different sets of info (e.g. all movies discussed, movies from 2017, movies from 2018, etc.). Please take this [SURVEY](https://youpoll.me/3722/) so we can gauge your interest.

So please fill out the survey and reply to this comment with your thoughts and comments on this idea. Thanks! Literally my only complaint about the movie was the wierd age gap between Chief Willoughby and his wife. 

It was distracting.  Especially since the movie made a point about how creepy it is for a 50+ year old man to be dating someone half his age.  Almost every scene between Woody harrelson and his wife would have played better if the actress had been within 10 years of his age at least.  It would have given the audience a sense of  deep connection and familiarity between the couple.  

But having a 35 year old actress play against a 56 year old man in a cutesy long-term marriage way makes it seem almost skeevy.   Add the girls accent and I am left almost wondering if she was bought online as a bride from overseas. 

It served no purpose to the plot except for random and unneeded eye-candy.   The acting in this film was phenomenal, as was much of the story, but I felt like the last 1/5th or so betrayed the rest of the film. I guess it's in sticking with a McDonagh flick, similar to *Pulp Fiction* where you kind of feel like the writer/director is just like, ""and then THIS crazy turn happens, and then THIS crazy thing also happens!""

When the movie has so many powerful moments (especially Woody Harrelson's final scenes), it seems like all the absurdity that comes later just washes out the deepness of the first half of the film.

Really is just such a shame. I'm glad others enjoyed this so much, but for as great as much of this movie was, and how incredible the acting was, it was just far too uneven and unfulfilling in the last half or quarter or so that I just ended up not liking it overall. So even though it was a smaller role, I have to say Samara Weaving killed it as her character. I thought she stole the show in both scenes she dropped in. Her facial expressions and body language really sold her character as being beautiful, but completely devoid of social awareness and smarts. Was a great contrast to her role in The Babysitter. Really excited to see her take off. This film left me oddly conflicted because I enjoyed the hell out of the movie in the theater but over the next 24 hours, all I could think about was all the gaping holes in the script. So does the movie ultimately succeed because I enjoyed the ride? Or does the film essentially cheat by presenting these emotional and cathartic moments without any actual adherence to logic to get to these points? I’m leaning towards the latter. Although, regardless, I think it’s easy to admit that this is McDonagh’s (either brother, for that matter) worst script.

The casting is probably most responsible for elevating it. I think the interrogation scene is a perfect example of how incredible Harrelson and McDormand’s chemistry was together. That being said, I can’t help but feel like they killed Willoughby off at least 20 minutes too early. It completely derailed the momentum.

Some other gripes:

- Dixon is presented as a violently racist cop. This is alluded to multiple times at the beginning of the film. This amounts to nothing and ultimately exists as more of a character quirk that’s pretty irrelevant. During his bar room beat down, the film’s two prominent black side characters are both present and yet they could’ve helped him in spite of his past or chosen not to because of it but instead no thought is given to it whatsoever. 

- In fact, the film kind of presented itself as a commentary on cops in America as the film opens: racism, incompetence, etc. But then it’s revealed that the cops haven’t actually done anything incompetently with the main case. It’s just unsolvable and the film is really about… guilt? revenge? It gets a little muddy there. I won’t fault a film for being misrepresented by its trailer (_Hail, Caesar_ did the same thing and I still enjoyed it) but I’d argue that the film, at least initially, thinks it’s about the same thing before losing its way.

- The cops are too incompetent. A man is thrown off a roof and the new police chief doesn’t even check on him? Two people are standing at the scene of a fire at the police station and nobody is curious? Charges are brought upon Mildred by the dentist she drilled into but that’s forgotten because Willoughby is sick. I don’t think that’s how it works. And don’t worry about assaulting two kids in a crowded area. Nobody cares.

- The Idaho man. WTF? So is he just passing through? Why the hell does he know Willoughby well enough to feel like he should threaten Mildred at work? Seems like a long commute to just be creepy to someone who he has no direct connection with. I don’t think the film wanted us to think that his innocence with this crime was ambiguous, but why was the scene with Dixon and the chief so fucking awkward? Why wouldn’t they just say he was deployed? And if it wasn’t supposed to be ambiguous, couldn’t the crime just’ve been rape and murder? Instead, we’re supposed to think it’s likely that two people have come into Dixon’s orbit that enjoy lighting people on fire _and fucking them while they’re on fire_!? That’s fucking dangerous. (Also that “she was so hot… literally” was painful).

- Willoughby’s wife and John Hawke’s GF were so poorely cast. I know it’s _possibly_ that a small town sherif could meet and marry a beautiful Australian women, but it raises more questions than its worth and is just needlessly distracting. Also, making the GF a bombshell also just leaves you wondering how Hawke snagged her, despite her walking in on him _strangling his ex-wife while his son holds a knife to her neck_ but she don’t care. Also there’s a mysterious comment about how he used to be a cop, but that’s also never touched upon again.

- Sam Rockwell was great in this. So I’m really bummed that his character wasn’t better constructed. Also, did anyone else think that there was supposed to be some sexual tension between Red and Dixon in that bar scene? If so, it was another thread that just kind of got abandoned. The forgiveness scene, on the other hand, is another instance where I really enjoyed the scene but, really, the dude nearly killed you and punched your secretary in the face.

- Is Lucas Hedges the only white teen male in Hollywood? This isn't a gripe because he’s been pretty great, I’m just saying: this, Ladybird, Manchester by the Sea. Dude is killing it and building an awesome resume.

There are just so many weird fucking holes in this script (I know there’s more that I’ve either forgotten or others in the comments have mentioned so I won’t bother repeating) that I can’t help but wonder if the script or film was gutted by people editing and meddling. It's really unfortunate that it detracts from what's also a very funny and well acted film, with some genuinely great moments. I’ve been a fan of Martin McDonagh’s writing since reading his plays in college. Also, if you haven’t seen it, I strongly recommend his short film _Six Shooter_ with Brendan Gleeson. Great stuff. This film, unfortunately, was a pretty big let down but I’m still glad I saw it. Hearing the fight where she yells ""I hope you get raped too!"" and it cutting back to the dead silence the empty room was heartbreaking. Just watched it, thought I was watching Coen brothers  I was definitely shocked that it was the ex-husband that lit the billboards on fire.  I don't really know why they made it him who did that...maybe just to fuel Mildred's anger even more.  But I don't feel like he actually would be so angry at her as to disrespect what it symbolized. Glad this discussion is finally up, where to start:

- Sam Rockwell was a revelation in this movie. He had me crying with him the whole time, never thought a racist cop could be so lovable.

- Good gravy, that police station firebomb scene was one of the best sequences in film I’ve seen all year.

- The desk sergeant and his little freak-outs were hilarious, good to see the annual Zeljko Ivanek appearance in a McDonagh movie wasn’t put to waste.

- Gotta Love whenever Lester Freeman shows up in a film, loved his role as the replacement chief.

- Frances McDormand. Dude. Just, yeah. My feelings on this movie are best summarized by [this user's review on another forum](http://criterionforum.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=14783&sid=8761e8ad2dae11f333051b6505937301#p603043).

Here's an excerpt:

> ...it always seems to center around McDormand's lack of any real respect for anyone but herself at this point in her life, which is funny to a point, and tragic to a point, but mostly just... without value from any kind of thematic or plot perspective.

> Eventually, it's clear that her only real investment in what happened to her daughter is the fact that it's *her daughter* - that something of hers was taken away and she must get revenge for her property being swiped from under her. There's a hollowness to her chosen method of interaction with everyone else on screen that makes it difficult to interpret the film's central pursuit any less cynically than that. Violence begets violence. So the one scene that I'm still having trouble wrapping my head around me is the gift shop scene. Why did the guy taunt Mildred if he had nothing to do with Angela's death?

Reading through this thread, a lot of people have offered plausible explanations which definitely are possibilities, but there's one I don't think I've seen discussed yet: is it possible that Abercrombie (the new police chief) was lying to Dixon? That in fact the DNA was a match, and the whole story about the guy being deployed was a lie? I mean, I can think of a few reasons why Abercrombie wouldn't want Dixon to be ""the guy"" who solved the murder. Just saw this, man what a great movie. I was so relieved that they didn't end the movie like 30 seconds too early. I thought they were ending it on the scene of them driving out. I'm so glad they added the scene in the car of them just cathartically doing all of this stuff. It would've completely changed the tone of the movie if they cut it without that scene. 

The one gripe about it is there were a lot of scenes that were just too on the nose...the I hope you get raped scene was just too much I thought. I really didn't need the whole anger begets anger scene of the movie. I think they did a fine job illustrating that without having to really hammer it home. I mean the use of fire throughout the movie really speaks to the point already. But I guess the director really wanted to make sure you didn't miss that point.  [deleted] Its the kind of movie where there are plainly a lot of flaws but at the same time the good is so damn good that it more or less makes up for the lot of them.  ""What about you hand me your badge and gun?""  
""......whut...huh?"" Mildred did not know that the guy Dixon saw at the bar was the same guy that came into her store or did she? An intensely frustrating movie. There's a good core to the story, but the execution - especially the writing - is wildly uneven, and in some spots just embarrassing. Everything is written very broadly and exaggerated, which is fine, but when the tone abruptly shifts to sentimentality, it doesn't work. I can't feel anything for characters who have been established as cartoon archetypes. There are many characters who aren't real people - they just exist to execute specific plot points or fumble through awkward, heavy-handed dialogue. The whole thing is just sloppy. To the point where it feels like there were last minute rewrites or problems in the editing room.

I'm baffled by the critics' love for this one. McDormand is fine; she certainly commits to the intensity of the character, but the performance is one-note. Angry woman is angry. Harrelson is on cruise control, Rockwell and Dinklage are playing paper-thin cartoon characters, and the actress who plays Harrelson's wife is notable only because of how horribly miscast she is and how little chemistry she has with Woody.

McDonagh is really only interested in Mildred, Willoughby, and Dixon. Which is fine. It's just frustrating that, as a result, every other character is only used as scaffolding to get from plot point A to plot point B.

The stylized dialogue and tonal shifts (the ex's girlfriend does *not* exist in the same universe as anyone else in the movie) are a matter of taste, but I'm really struggling to understand how folks are swallowing the rickety construction underlying this film. It unavoidably comes off as Coen Brothers fan fiction.

Some other stuff that annoyed me:

- The ex-husband's girlfriend, who is so over-the-top cartoonish and tonally different than everyone else in the scene, that it feels like she's pausing for a laugh track
- The ""hilarious"" Big Bang Theory-level physical comedy of kicking two high school students in the crotch. Again, tonal whiplash.
- The most uncomfortable, unconvincing line reading of the year - ""That was a real nice fuck. You got a real nice cock, Mr. Willoughby.” (what human would say that?)
- The one-dimensionality of the female characters. Girlfriend and office assistant are ditzy. Daughter is a bitch. Mom is old and racist. Wife is hot and loves husband. Black shop owner is...black.

And the series of absurd coincidences that lead up to Dixon's wholly unearned ""turn"":

- Dixon just so happens to be the only cop in the station when it's firebombed
- Dinklage, whose character exists mostly so others can call him a midget, and who just so happens to have a crush on McDormand, also just so happens to be the only human within earshot of the station as she's firebombing it
- Police chief ignores Dinklage's obvious lying and the fact that McDormand IS WEARING A BACKPACK AND HAS A GRUDGE AGAINST THE POLICE
- Dixon just so happens to be placed in the same hospital room as the guy he threw out a window
- Red, for no rational reason, forgives Dixon
- Dixon just so happens to be drinking in the booth adjacent to a guy loudly bragging about raping a girl
- Black couple, whose characters exist for no other reason than to witness Dixon's assault, just so happen to be in the same bar at the same time This is the first film I have given a perfect 5 STARS to since Whiplash, which was over 3 years ago.

I didn't expect this movie to be this good. Wow This shit blew me the fuck away. I was dying laughing one minute then the next I was almost on the verge of tears. Had me glued to the screen every second and the script was really unpredictable. I had no idea where the movie was going.

It quite reminded me of Manchester By the Sea with the mix between dark humor and tragedy. I also did not expect it to be this so apologetically vulgar. And god damn this was the most redneck shit I have seen and I loved every minute of it.

It had some of the most memorable characters in film I have ever seen. Almost everyone is flawed in this movie and I love it. Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrellson stole the damn movie. Some of the finest acting ever. Martin McDonagh wrote and directed the fuck out of this. The dialogue is so incredible and raw.

This one is a must watch and I doubt anything else will top this movie for me this year even though there are so many good movies this year.  Overall, the whole thing felt like it was written by someone who only knew small town America from articles in The New Yorker. Look at all these salt of the earth folks, with their vague homey accents (that keep going in and out, most noticeably with Dinklage), antenna TVs and flip phones, wearing coveralls all the time even if they work a retail gig at a gift shop. It all felt so phony and inauthentic. So many characters read like caricatures of what the writer figured a Middle American [insert occupation here] must be like. Sure, it's totally okay for a journalist to publicly speculate that Prominent Person A drove Prominent Person B to suicide. Sure, grown adults can publicly assault children in front of their school. Sure, small-town police officers always attempt to murder local businessmen in broad daylight and face no legal repercussions for it. These people are too folksy to press charges.

The handful of black characters seemed to exist as plot devices, helping out the good white folk, and being mistreated by the bad ones.

There's the issue of Mildred as a character. The tone of the movie seems to suggest that we should root for her, but I'm sorry, this woman is dangerous, not in a ""grrr momma bear"" way but in a criminally deranged way. By the end of the film she has committed multiple felonies and is considering committing more.

The Rockwell character's turn felt very sudden and unearned.

The sequence with the dentist was absurd and did not need to be in the movie.

Frances McDormand was good but she wasn't doing anything we haven't seen her do before. She deserves Oscars in general, but not for this particular performance. I really likedd this movie! Fantastic performances all around. Woody Harrelson's suicide especially caught me off guard and was a tragic scene.

I'm confused about one thing, however: Rockwell's character throws a guy out the window and nearly kills him and he admits this to his (new) boss and is only fired? Why the hell didn't he get arrested on the spot? Great movie. The greatness of the movie definitely comes from the acting and direction, as I do have issues with the script and character motives. I felt McDormand's character was morally wrong and some of her actions unjustifiable. Normally this would be okay, but the movie seemed to not have addressed this at all. Her case had no leads, there was nothing anyone could do; why would she burn down the police station? Stabbing the dentist? Wasting her money on those billboards? Like Woody's character said, the only way the case would be solved would be through sheer luck and ""stupidity"". And that's exactly what almost happened. The case was a dud. I felt the movie should have addressed McDormand's character's actions a little more. 

In my mind she was in the wrong and she was bringing everyone around her down along with her. And the film did nothing to address this, not in any degree. But goddamn some of the scenes in this movie were perfect. 

Great movie. Almost best picture worthy.  One of those films where you get swept away in the sheer oddity of it. Huge emotional swings, great acting. Well done all around. Good film and Frances McDormand gives probably the best performance of her career, but I have to say that overall I felt underwhelmed by the movie. I did think it was really good, but it didn't pack the punch I was expecting. Personally I enjoyed In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths more than this. Everyone's talking best picture frontrunner, and right now I just don't see it. I don't know, maybe I need to watch it again. I thought it was the best film I've seen in years.  This is not a film about a gruesome crime.  It's not a film about corrupt police or finding a killer.  It's not really about three billboards and the consequences that arise from putting them up.  This is a film about grief. 


All the main characters are all grieving to some extent, and they all handle it differently.  The wild swings in scenes and characters doing unpredictable and/or out-of-character things: that's grief.  There are moments where characters are fine and then they're feeling intense emotions: grief.  Those moments of intense unexpected violence: grief.  Slight insanity/talking to slippers: grief. 


If you've never lost someone you were close to and dealt with that grief, then you may not be able to understand this film.  I can see where you'd think these characters were too extreme. 


In the last 4 years, I've lost a lot of people that were important to me, and I've learned a lot about grief as a result.  I didn't find the characters or the plot unbelievable.  Maybe exaggerated a bit for plot purposes, but this felt real to me.  Violent, funny, profane.  This is real life, and real people dealing with real emotional stuff. 


Also, I think it's helped me in my own grieving process, and for that, I'm grateful.  Feel free to downvote, but this movie just didn't work for me. Some of the characters seemed like straight caricatures. And it was strange to have Chief Willoughby's (sp?) voice be completely different in the letters. Just felt off to me.

The acting was standout, though. Rockwell really brought it home and Harrelson started great. Of course Frances was amazing.

My biggest problem was the writing. It felt like it was mimic-ing what the Coen Brothers do, but ultimately felt empty/shallow/cheap.

I hope you guys enjoyed the movie though and also thanks for going to the movies. I love movies. Am I the only one who noticed that the movie has the theme or at least the imagery of being childish?

- The discarded baby images in the billboard
- The swing set
- Mildred eating cereals
- Mildred making her slippers ""talk""
- Dixon and his momma
- The ex-husband's girl
- And the whole Mildred and Dixon bickering and beating up people like a bunch of children I was entertained. The plot had holes, which after a while I grew to accept in a surreal presentation sort of way. I was a bit surprised got an oscar nomination, but I did enjoy watching it.

My one real problem was the casting of Abbie Cornish. Her performance was completely hammy and in some shots I was totally taken out of the story. Was she chosen for her built-in audience I wonder? I fucking love this movie Finally got a chance to see Three Billboards. Loved it, but I definitely do have share some of the same complaints with others regarding the CGI deer, the ""i hope you get raped"" bit, other various holes...but one thing nobody has brought up is how Mildrid called the police dept numerous times to ensure nobody was there (right?) then lit it up. since when do police stations fully close down at night? isn't there at least a person or two there overnight? I want a whole movie of the 19-year-old girlfriend in awkward situations she was fucking hilarious I love that Dixon reads and wears shirts of the comic Incorruptible. The comic is about a villain who wants to be a hero but just doesn't know how. I felt like that fit his story arc really well. [Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri](http://hvnreviews.com/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri/) is my favorite film of the year because it features the absolute strongest character work I've seen all year. Not just in the fantastic writing and directing, but some of the best character actors who truly understand the depth of the people they're portraying. Probably the most riveting film I've seen all year. I was laughing hysterically in one scene, and almost choking back tears the next. Masterful storytelling. Can we talk about Abbie Cornish’s accent? Was she supposed to be Australian? Southern?  So I'll be probably one of the only negative voices here and say this was one of my biggest disappointments of the year. I love Martin McDonagh. I've read every one of his plays and while I really love In Bruges and thought Seven Psychopaths was solid none of his films really felt like his A-game. So with all this praise and all this hype I was so excited for this film and it was just kind of a mush for me.

It's not bad by any means, better that SP in fact, but I just found it okay. The acting is undeniable, two of the best performances of the year from basically the leads McDormand and Rockwell. But the film just felt like a bunch of undercooked ideas. Didn't help that it really felt like a stage play he quickly adapted to a film, especially the last line which you can almost see the stage dimming to black on. 

I get the point of the film and the themes of grief and revenge. I get that at the end it's about do you want them to kill the rapist or not. I just don't think it achieved what it set out to do. I didn't care much for the characters and there was just no narrative thrust for me to latch on to. 

I really really wish I saw the film other people saw, cause it just wasn't very interesting to me. I really enjoyed the movies. It's getting a lot of hate in this thread for it's ""flaws"" but I thought that was part of the charm. Real life has flaws, a movie doesn't have to tell a perfect story-just a story.  ""Why are you moving out?"" .. I did one of those catch you unawares spaz laughs. Brilliant film Just saw the movie. Definitely was a good one and deserves a lot of the nominations it has received. A few things though:

1. The writing seemed to hiccup a little throughout. For example [the argument the mother and daughter had right before she died.](#spoiler). There are ways of portraying the dramatic irony they were trying to get across without making it match so well.. Another time was at the bar near the end [when you think the man in the bar is the murderer. What he's describing is almost identical to the murder that's the major focal point.](#spoiler). The plot has already made the guy a suspect. Everyone in the audience is already assuming he's the guy. The writing could have been much more subtle to achieve the same thing [however then it would have been believable later when you find out it's not him. Hard to suspend disbelief when a guy who committed almost the same rape/murder decides he's just going to hang around a small town in a different state than he's from where they're searching for someone who committed the same exact crime](#spoiler) 

2. I didn't mind the ending at all. I've seen people complaining about it but I don't really mind the ambiguous endings and I think all the major conflicts between characters were pretty well resolved. 

3. I get the point of anger spreading from person to person and everything but it seemed like the character development was a bit rushed at times and some of the choices they made were odd. 


Overall I liked it though.  Just watched this and the movie has left me in an extremely negative and downbeat state of mind. WTF!?!? I had to look away when the Dentist applied novacaine--I may have missed something? Because I don't understand why she stabbed him--did she think he was going to hurt her intentionally? This may get lost in the comments, but I was completely underwhelmed with the ending. I absolutely loved the movie, but am feeling like I need closure. Earlier in the movie, there is the flashback where mcdormand and newton are arguing. I saw this flashback scene and originally thought they would have a later scene set in the past explaining what happened the night Newton’s character was raped and killed, and we’d find out the culprit (similar to the movie wind river with The scene with bernthal and asbille). It takes the mystery out of knowing, but if executed well, I thought it would have added a whole other element and feeling to the film. 
That being said, it would not mean anything if the rapist/killer was just some random person, possibly passing through town or through the country..but still!!  There was a ton here that I really loved, but at the same time I had a hard time feeling like it came together in a unified, coherent way. There is a lot going on with themes of grief, guilt, and pain, but a lot of it feels a little scattershot and unfocused. I loved the parallels between how Angela and the sheriff deal with their own pain, one emotional and the other physical, but none of these themes seemed to carry over into the rest of the movie.

The tonal shifts I also found a little odd, and nowhere near as deftly handled as in *In Bruges*. A lot of the writing, while technically good, seems very self-satisfied, and in some cases, like in Willoughby's suicide notes, are borderline contrived in how ""movie-ish"" they seem.

All that said, the performances are unimpeachable, and though I don't think it necessarily comes together, there's so much going on in so many directions it was an endlessly interesting and entertaining movie. Silly question, but what was with Anne's accent? Did it change throughout the film?  Those were Xbox games and a PS3 controller  This was a very nice progression in Martin McDonagh's works. It is a film where horrible people are doing absolutely horrible things to each other...yet somehow manages to be optimistic about humanity. I loved it! Really loved it. A lot of people are giving grief for the ""I hope you get raped"" line, I didn't take it so seriously. Knowing McDonagh's writing, I interpreted that as a dark joke rather than as a sincere piece of dialogue. McDonagh's plays and films have always been very self-aware and self-referential. It's just his style. I get that some people don't like that though. And that's cool. Watched it yesterday and I really enjoyed it. Just one thing I didn't get : Why does the military guy go to Mildred's store and acts like that? If he wasn't the culprit, then is it just a big coincidence? Or maybe he is in fact guilty and the DNA thing didn't work properly for some reason? No one thinks that Mildred and her ex husband's girlfriend where characterized to represent two aspects of the feminine? Mildred being the self-asserted, strong, aware, brutal woman that takes no shit neither from people nor from the system while the ex husband's girlfriend represents the feminine that is still subjugated, un-aware, un-movable and quiet frankly vapid that can't accomplish anything without the help of people? No one talks about the representation of the lived feminine and what the messages behind the movie truly are. None of you has talked about the tragedy that is rape, violence and death by those things and the tragedy that women and mothers have to face when those things happen. I don't know, imo the whole point of the movie is to highlight such themes in a dark, nihilistic and claustrophobic way, one that makes you forever and ever turn away from any of the action perpetrated in it. 
P.s: I'm sorry if what i wrote is not completely coherent and grammatically correct, english is not my first language. 
P.p.s: maybe I've just stated the obvious, obviously you all have taken into consideration the tragedy that is rape and violence what i meant is that it hasn't been taken in consideration into the characterization of Mildred and of all the other people that surround her, like none of them could really understand what it feels like to go through such thing Well when you get cast in the sitcom “Old Lady House: A Situation Comedy“ it’s bound to happen  Guarantee that every script that woman has been involved has had the word ""chainsmoking"" in it at least 3 times This was the first time that i realized that Mac's Mom and Napoleon's Grandma were the same actress. I saw her for the majority of the movie as Napoleon Dynamite's grandmother, although the scene when she was pounding on the bathroom door to get to Jason was utterly heartbreaking.  He was the same guy who came in and taunted her, threatened her. I think his superior covered his ass for fear of it getting out that one of his men was a killer. As soon as she gets a glimpse of him she'll tell Dixon it's him and boom, justice baby. i must say, dope point!
 In the meeting between Mildred and Willoughby, he says 'what if he was just passing through the country'. Then at the end Dixon and her go after the wrong guy, who was just passing through some sandy country and probably did something nasty. Great writing throughout. Woah.. good catch!  This right here cleared the ending up for me. I was okay with not knowing who killed the daughter (again sometimes shit like that really does happen, and they police can't find out who did it) but calling back to that scene and the culpability theme makes the ending even that more satisfying. Plus once the find out it was that same cunt that threw the 7 dollar penguin at her you know she's gonna shoot his ass. I loved all of Harrelson's letters, especially his one to Rockwell. Even though he was gone fairly early on, you could feel his presence throughout the entire film. He really put a lot into such a small role, and his suicide drew a lot of emotion out of me.  ""Please excuse me while I go to the little boys room."" Almost did a spit-take She read it on a bookmark. In a book. I caught a late showing last night, the only other people in the theater being 2 older couples, and I was the only one laughing at “begets?” and “little boys room”.  Made me seem a bit loud 😅 That part was crushing Watched it today; it was an incredible moment! The woman who always has some sass ready and always seems so tough, could only scream in agony. Really shows how defeating that was for her.  It was a metaphor for not being able to help her daughter who burned in the exact same place right? That broke my heart. Absolutely devastating.  The scream was so raw. Spine tingling  This movie should've been called ""Tonal Whiplash: The Movie.""

-Dad's here! (knife to throat)

-I HOPE YOU GET RAPED! See what I loved about the scene where he coughed up blood is that they are kind of going at each other’s necks. They are both huge pain in the asses to each other, and she almost seems to borderline hate Harrelson, but when he does that she knew immediately something was wrong. He is so beside himself that he did that, he wants to make sure she didn’t think he did it on purpose, where she grabs his hand and says “honey it’s alright” and calls for the EMTs. She is callous, but she isn’t heartless. 

(I can’t remember the actor’s name) but when the ex-husband comes back, he flips a table over, but moments later she’s grabbing his hand crying with him about the loss of their daughter, before it turned into a stringing insult of “she wouldn’t be dead if she were with me.” She shows compassion and softness even in the midst of her sorrow and distress.  also the idea that there's just some guy working on the top floor of some ancient building in some old village in Missouri that's slowly falling to pieces, and he sells ads and billboards (like, what ad space could he possibly be selling? and to whom?) -- it's just so funny to me Caleb Landry Jones is having one hell of a year This scene made me tear up. The fact that Red is sitting face to face with the person that put him in the hospital, and all he does is give him some orange juice. The heart of that character. [deleted] I sobbed during this scene. I didn’t expect something like that walking into this film. I knew I’d laugh and I’d knew there’d be some emotional weight, but I didn’t think I’d be weeping at the mere sight of Sam Rockwell getting a glass of orange juice.  The tracking shot got a lot of laughs? That scene just made me super uncomfortable, and I'm not usually sensitive to violence in movies at all Came to this discussion just to see if anyone else thought Dixon was gay! Guess it's confirmed. I felt a little bit of it when Dixon was being comforted by the other officer in the bathroom. I was actually preparing something sexual to occur  I noticed that during the seen in the bathroom where he is consoling Dixon, there's a moment of uncomfortableness on Dixon's face. 

My take was that he was not gay but very homophobic to the point where any kind of kindness between two men was grounds for them being possibly gay in his mind When Dixon got close to Red in the pool scene, the thought of him being gay did cross my mind. Also, the Chief mentioned if they got rid of everyone who wasn't at least a little racist (Dixon) all they would have was people who hated gay people.  And the ""how gay was treated in"" talks in the beginning when they were playing pool.  MotOE? I think it was a champagne bottle, which i imagine would cause a lot of damage (being thicker and heavier than a wine bottle)

Also, i believe she WAS going to smash the bottle over her ex (he just admitted to setting the fires, which Mildred seemed shocked to hear), but spared her asshole ex because his 19 year old girlfriends bookmark-wisdom got through to her -- afterall, ex-husband set fires, which in turn led her to burn down the police station in an act of musguided vengeance, badly burning and almost killing Dixon. She (briefly) broke the cycle of revenge But... ""Penelope said Begets?"" >Also, I loved Peter Dinklage in this

Why?  There was nothing to his character.  His only character trait was ""little person who like Mildred and is the but of jokes"".  He had no character development or arc.  

Dinklage is better than this role in my opinion. And what about the turtle???!!! I thought it stole the scene when Dixon's mum slept on the couch. That scene is OSCAR worthy. I really hated his character at that point.  Still don’t see how he got away with busting two windows and beating two people inside of their own business. Really well done scene but at no point was I ever sympathizing with Dixon. He was anger and hate all bottled up, just looking for someone to point it at. He was abusing his power and, not for the first time, taking it out on a citizen. That attack could have easily led to Red's death and Dixon also assaulted a young woman who clearly had nothing to do with it just because she was there. He was a piece of shit. I thought the point was to show that the characters were no longer driven by solely anger. They were changing, not like a huge change, but something.  i agree to a point. that would have been a good place to end but i was really happy we got the scene of Mildred admitting to Dixon that she burned the police station. And Dixon learning from Red to forgive people and not worry about it. Dixon had such a good arch and that was a perfect end to his character. I liked the car scene because it wouldn't ring true to me that they'd actually go through with it. I think they're both angry and looking for an outlet. Of course, it's intentionally left ambiguous, but I get the sense from the car scene that there's at least a good chance they won't actually do it.

If the movie had ended on the phone call, it would've been less ambiguous and too dark. I think the car ride was important because it kind of showed that they may not follow through on the murder. Hammer home the theme, violence begets more violence.  ""Maybe I'll see you again if there's another place. If not, it's been heaven knowing you."" 

😭 [deleted] My eight-months pregnant girlfriend started the waterworks when he was reading the letter he left to his wife. And then the tears got makeup in her eye resulting in more crying. That was a great scene though. Got me choked up. and then they made his good bye letters genuinely hilarious, so much emotional whiplash I've literally never been in the middle of crying and then choked with laughter during a movie before. That was so intense and genuine.  For me, it was when he was interrogating McDormand at the station. Seeing their characters do a complete 180 in that moment was so beautiful, to me. To see him be in that position of power, threatening to take serious action, then to all of the sudden be at the mercy of his health...fantastic writing on McDonagh's part.  Yesterday I was just thinking of that ""I read it in a book.... mark"" line. So fucking funny. I didnt even notice it was CGI... I think they’re lucky that it was SO bad that it weirdly fits into the bleak, sad hilarity of the movie, as opposed to a slightly better computer animal that almost looks real.

But man that deer was bad. I thought the CGI deer was kind of off-putting. A shitty CGI deer doesn’t change the fact that this was a really good film, but Jesus fucking Christ - just get a real fucking deer. Terrible CGI but McDormand was so, so good in that scene. In fact, there could have been no deer at all in the scene and it might have still worked. It reminded me of that horrible one from The Walking Dead.  I thought it was a real deer, green screened in poorly. I don't think the deer itself was CG, I think it was digitally inserted from a different shot. Poorly. I think that's my one complaint with this movie. Other than that, absolutely phenomenal. I don't think it was directly mentioned either- the viewer is left to figure this out, which I think makes it far more powerful.

(I would guess that they filmed a scene where it's spelled out though) I'll be honest, I didn't clue into that. That is so heartbreaking.  She was raped and died in view of the house and in broad daylight. I never even connected that until reading your comment. 

I hate/love everything about this fucking movie. It is also incredibly tragic because the daughter was so close to home and safety. Just a little bit farther. Not only that, it makes you wonder who found her scorched remains, since no one else uses that road. I just saw it last night. What tipped me off to it was the fact that she kept bringing flowers to the spot at the billboard as a memorial. That, and as another person pointed out, when the cops went to the billboards to look at the crime scene area. I’m doing to have to rewatch the movie because I didn’t pick up on this at all and that would have ruined me had I noticed.  What was going on with Abbie Cornish's bad acting?

The scene of her giving Frances McDormand the letter was the funniest scene in the film, entirely unintentionally So the actress is Australian, but I also couldn't place her accent. I think that's relatively realistic, though, in that someone with an accent moving to the South would end up with some sort of weird hybrid accent.

I liked what another Redditor said, that it gives you some texture into their life. There's a good chance Chief Willoughby was stationed in a bigger city at some point, where they met, and then they moved to Ebbing so he could be Chief. Yea I thought the same.. I was like, uh what is she trying to portray? Nah, they're just setting up a sequel. Didn't you see the after credits scene? I think the point is that we don't know. I think one of the central themes of this movie is choice. Choice is what dictates the major elements of the film. You have overt choice like Willoughby choosing to kill himself that slaps you in the face with the theme. Then you have the more telling choices like Mildred choosing to burn down the police station and we see that if Dixon didn't choose to grab the case file on the daughter, her choice would have literally burned her daughter's case. When Dinklage's character James calls Mildred out he basically says that everything has always been her choice and she acts like her hand has been forced. And right after that we think she's going to be Mildred and beat the hell out of either her ex or his girlfriend, but she chooses not to.   
  
What I'm getting at is McDonagh purposefully put that ambiguity of the gift shop scene in there. He's leaving that choice to the viewer. Was he a rapist? Was he just a liar? The film ends with Mildred and Dixon saying they don't know if they should kill the guy. They decided to make the choice on the way there and in that conversation the film completes its arc. Instead of being filled with conviction that they know the Truth, they instead admit that they are uncertain and allows themselves to be vulnerable to each other.   
  
If we as an audience had definitive proof that the guy wasn't or was guilty I think it could have diluted that message. We needed to be in their position of uncertainty to feel the weight of their eventual choice. Instead of giving us an answer, the movie ends and we make the choice just like the main characters. I thought it was a brilliant way of taking the core themes of the film and thrusting them on the audience in a way that leaves you uncomfortable.  [deleted] I think its easier to believe that he is just a freak who gets off on murder stories. 

Dig into any famous killing and you will find a bunch of creeps who admit to doing it despite not being anywhere near the place where it occured.  A lot of them will also harass the families of the victims (many murdered kids parents end up getting creepy phone calls from complete strangers saying they know what happened or claiming to be the dead kid;  people are fucked up) 

I think the guy just didnt get the respect he thought he would automatically be due upon becoming a soldier and is pissed about it. 

Maybe he is a rapist;  but I definitely dont think he killed anyone. More likely he is just a fucked up guy who read the story in a newspaper and decided to manipulate a grieving mother because it made him feel superior. Violence begets violence. The point is that love is greater than hate.  And acting out of hatred and fear only breeds more violence. Love of our fellow man is the path to a better world.

Pretty simplistic point in a way, but also a pretty obvious one.

Given that the whole tone of the movie changed after Rockwell read those words from the sheriff I think that the point was pretty clear. Thank you so much for having the same opinion as me. If someone asked me what Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is about I wouldn't be able to tell them. I sat in the theatre for 2 hours and almost felt lost when the end credits kicked in. I feel like I missed the entire point of the movie. Is it about a girl that was raped while dying? is it about injustice? Is it about terminal illness? Is it about three fucking billboards? What on earth was this movie attempting to convey? To me, i's about how we all muddle through life while looking for purpose, whether or not it's there. Sometimes terrible things happen, and sometimes we fail. Sometimes we try our best, and sometimes we're flawed.

It doesn't have a single point, per se, but is just a reflection of how people deal with life when life gets difficult.

There are two scenes in particular that made me cry:

One was Willoughby's final moments.  I think it made me cry because: He tried his best. He tried to be a good chief. He wasn't perfect. He couldn't get rid of racism or homophobia in his force, and he couldn't solve the case. Maybe he didn't deserve Mildred's scorn. He certainly didn't deserve to get terminal cancer. But that's just life sometimes.

The other was the scene in the hospital with Dixon and Red, when Red gave Dixon the orange juice. I loved that little bit of human decency, the sense that we're all in it together... helped in this case that these two are literally both in bandages together.

Thinking about those scenes made me cry again when I was driving home.

And I wasn't crying about any particular sad event in the movie. I was crying because, well, like, the human condition, man. :P

* * *

As for the motivations of the characters, I see Dixon as someone who clearly hasn't grown up in the best environment with the best resources, and he's angry at the world. He has loyalties, like to Chief Willoughby. He wants to have a sense of purpose. When he's fired, he literally has no idea what he's supposed to be doing.  He doesn't realize what he's lost until he loses it.

I see Mildred as someone who's not that different from Dixon, really. She's also a very flawed person who has trouble dealing with others. She's wracked with guilt over her daughter's death, and she's expressing it by lashing out with anger at others. Of course, it's not really her fault, and she's also angry at the injustice of the world.

They're both trying to find their place in a world that they don't feel they fit into.

* * *

Thanks for giving me a chance to work out my own thoughts about the movie! :)  I knew it hit me emotionally, but this sort of let me clarify in my own mind why that is.

It's all summed up by when Mildred asks the deer why there haven't been arrests yet:

*'Cause there ain't no God, and the whole world's empty, and it doesn't matter what we do to each other? I hope not.* Agreed... Same for Rockwell; great Villain to Hero transition  She's the favorite to win though she has tough competition with Saoirse Ronan and Meryl Streep.  Definitely. I'm going to try to explain myself as best as I can:
 Something I specially loved and appreciated is the fact that she's not just ""a leading female role"" to make people contempt about the current Hollywood situation, but she's a whole character herself, a whole person, with flaws, motivations and a million angles. I just feel that she was written as a character, -what mostly men actors get- not only as a ""female leading role"".  I agree quite a bit. This guy raped someone and burnt their body and even went to Mildred’s work. They did foreshadow a lot when the chief died and said someday someone will brag in a bar.. they told us this is what will happen. The man said his friends watched and I have wondered if he in fact wasn’t one of the friends who was watching and we never saw who the killer was? Maybe that explains the dna not being his, maybe he wanted credit for it. Either way I agree he was a participant. Great movie. Really interesting take. I haven't considered this before! It was definitely the guy in the bar. The theme of this movie is moral ambiguity. Each character has moral and immoral sides to them. Every single one. They even made Dixon’s mother a racist. Except Abercrombie. So why is that? He MUST have something immoral about him. And what is that?  It’s the cover up of the military for the murder. It’s 100% what the movie is going for here I’m sure of it.  You make an interesting case, I hadn't thought about that at all.  Maybe because I'm not totally disenfranchised with law enforcement, or the fact that the new chief seemed like a moral superior, after what he did.
 I'm sure Abercrombie talked to Dixon after the fire, and realized the dude did have a change of heart? Like wouldn't he be thinking that Dixon started the fire, but if he rescued the Hayes file, that he must be changed in his excommunication from the force? I guess I was just assuming that the new chief was incorruptible, but I do like your interpretation.  Well this explains why Dixon, having the realization that Abercrombie is covering up for that rapist, suddenly ""found"" his badge and gave it back, like he had a realization that it's no use and must have lost hope in the system and justice, and that must have been why he almost tried to kill himself? 

edit: sorry i'm months late on this, but still a great movie.   The guy didn't rape Angela; he likely raped a civilian woman or prisoner of war in Afghanistan/Iraq. It's not spelled out but we know the guy was in the military, that he was somewhere sandy, and that weirdly enough, gasoline and fire were involved in the rape, which sounds bogus unless you think of wartime. 


  He tells his bar friend he raped a girl ""9-10 months ago"". This corresponds to when he was still in active duty right before he came back. Perhaps because he was discharged. Or maybe wartime was ceasing. Either way, the guy is a sociopath and a sadist. If he's the kind of guy who would rape a woman while fighting in the Middle East and brag about it to a friend then he would probably be the kind of guy to be sickly intrigued by the content of the billboards and would get a kick out of causing suffering by fucking with Mildred. I personally think this was included to make the ending more ambiguous, and I'm fine with that even though causally it doesn't make the most sense. It allows for the possibility that Mildred will recognize him and because of this they actually will carry out the murder. this was my thinking exactly. very well put. a subtle dig at the military covering up for their own on home soil as well. it raises the question was he purely taunting Mildred or trying to intimidate her to get the case out of the public eye? “There will be no more 'cunts' in this house.”

""What, are you moving out?"" ""Hey Fuckhead!""
""What?""
""DON'T SAY WHAT, DIXON, WHEN SHE COMES IN HERE CALLING YOU A FUCKHEAD!"" [deleted] ""all i've got are some Dorritos, but they're kinda pointy"" I was sort of shocked at how laugh out loud many moments in this movie were, Penélope was an absolute riot in her brief scenes. My favorite subtle joke was Dinklage's character saying he had to go to the ""little boy's room"". >Mildred's rant about the Gangs to the Priest.

This to me was the most cringe I have felt in a movie this year.

I guess the rant makes sense if you already blindly hate all things religious, but it felt like when I'm watching a stand up comedian talk about politics in a way that only their side is going to get a laugh out of because of the inherent bias and logical fallacies.

Of all the purposeless things that happened in this movie, this topped it for me. And then that cut to her looking silently at her daughter's room. Oof. I think that moment speaks to McDonagh The Director’s ability to execute McDonagh The Writer, because writing something *that* on the nose is dangerous when putting it in the hands of someone who could shoot it in a way that feels convenient or oddly trite (or as trite as wishing rape on your daughter can sound, anyway). But it works, and the air pressure in the theater changes as everyone inaudibly gasps.

Also doesn’t hurt having Frances McDormand there to crush the delivery like she’s prime Barry Bonds taking bp. God damn she is incredible. [deleted] I may have said ""OH FUCK"" out loud in the theater at that. :O that long take of him busting into the real estate office was killer I guessed from the trailer that he'd be the killer.  To say that I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement.  I completely underestimated Martin McDonagh. It was certainly well acted, but the writing of his character was pretty bad.  It was more of a character switch than an arc.  All it took to take him from a caricature of a bad cop to a super cop was one short letter from his dead former boss.  There was no real development there, he just immediately goes from making the worst decision in each situation to making the best. It's either him or Willem Dafoe  I've never been so behind actors winning Oscars as much as those two for leading actress and supporting actor. Also this movie better win a writing award too or we riot.  It’s actually good practice to keep a fire extinguisher in your car in the case it ever caught fire.  Isn’t that a common thing?  Her English accent felt so strange to me, but yeah, that voice tho.  I completely agree about the wife's accent. It didn't really make sense for someone in a small town in middle America to have a foreign wife, so I kept thinking she was a more important character than she really ended up being.  You hit the nail on the head as to my feelings with the film as well. The only thing I would add that also bothered me was how ""written"" the dialogue felt. Sure a lot of what is said is very funny and witty but most of the time I was left wondering of these characters really spoke that way all of time. I gotta agree. Which is too bad because parts of the film are amazing, so it just stands out when bits and pieces just don't work at all. But they don't work *so* much that it just can't seem to wipe them from your head and it weighs the film down just enough. I was relieved to read your comment because I felt the same way. It was an enjoyable movie but it wasn't a classic like Fargo for lots of reasons.

The dialogue really took me out of it nearly all the way through. It was just too crude. The wife saying ""you have a great cock"", the son calling the mother a cunt, the ""I hope you get raped"". I'm not a prude but this kind of dialogue needs to be used in the right context.

If it was one character then you could just think ""it's a crudely-drawn comic caricature side-character"" but it was the whole town. It reminded me of being in the first year of university in the common room with some ""larger than life"" characters who had just found out they can swear without being told off.

The performances were good, great in places but again with the shallow depth of the dialogue and characterisation were kind of wasted.

There was also a lot of sentimentality and telling the viewer how to feel. She might have a heart of gold and have experienced pain but burning down a police station means she needs to go to jail. I don't get why that didn't figure in the film at all - it just made it seem like a writer first / plot point first / entertainment first empty piece with no authenticity.

It was entertaining and I might have it on in the background on TV while doing something else but it didn't speak to me, and left me uncomfortable in lots of places.

 >out-of-place ex-husband's girlfriend

She's the idiot of the film.  The ex-husband chasing after an impressionable young 19-year-old who literally walks in on a woman being physically abused and he reaction is: ""Err... I'll go wait outside"" just emphasises the constant motif of 'morally ambiguous' -- she cares more for animals, than a woman being abused in front of her.  She's also comic relief for that scene, and lets the tone change.

On top of that, she delivers the whole didactic of the film: ""Love begets love"", or the opposite: ""Anger begets anger"".

>Chief Willoughby's wife's confusing accent

Why is everyone strung up on an Australian accent?  Is it really *that* hard to believe that Harrelson's character could've snagged someone on holiday (or whatever).

Besides, it serves as the opposite of Mildred's ex-husband: despite an obvious age difference, if you treat her with love, she'll become a good Mother.  They have two kids, just like Mildred, but the kids seem remarkably sweet, and the family is very well put together (at least until their Daddy commits suicide).  

>the existence of the gift shop scene

No defence there.  Other than the guy being a bit of a loony.  If he really was a rapist in Afghanistan though, the billboards probably triggered some PTSD or some shit, and he doesn't want to me reminded of it.  He doesn't mind bragging 'to the boys', but 'the boys' aren't there when you're driving alone on a road to town and are faced with the reality of what you actions might do to real people.

>how on-the-nose the scene when Rockwell overhears the alleged rapist was

I'm not quite sure what you're saying here.  But, this was foreshadowed in Harrelson's letter: ""You might hear someone in a bar bragging about something"". Unless you're saying that it's *too* perfect, of course.

>and of course the weird CGI deer that ruined what would've been a great scene.

Yeah no defence for that. He's actually not linked to Willoughby at all. It's implied that he's simply a passerby that stopped in the town on the way back to Idaho. While he's in town, he sees the news about Willoughby and the news about Angela's death. Putting two and two together, he goes to Mildred's gift shop and torments her because he, too, is a fucked up rapist and wants to get a rise from her. He doesn't care about the town's problems, he just wants to get off on seeing Mildred squirm. The gift shop appearance establishes his character for the later bar scene where Dixon finds him. He's not *the* rapist, but he is *a* rapist. They fake you out with the horses...and hit your right in the feels. Her face screaming for the extinguisher was the face of a mother trying to save her baby.

Goddamn, this movie has me all kinds of fucked up. McDormand was a revelation. Such a new take on the grieving mother trope. Yeah, I loved the balance of comedy and drama; really made it feel real. I think the grey morality of the characters really helped sell the ambiguity of the ending. ""Don't say 'what', Dixon, when she comes in here calling you a fuckhead!"" Sam Rockwell best get a nomination. I loved his character arc. It very much reminded me of the Jaime arc in Game of Thrones Amazingly bad written arc, getting into bar fight doesn't make up for a lifetime of being a literal racist asshole and nearly killing a guy a public assault for just doing his job. 

His character was a shitstain on planet earth at the start and he was still that at the end, he just had some burns on his neck now.  You missed the point of the film. 

It's about moral greys. Killing the rapist won't solve whoever murdered Mildred's daughter, nor will it reverse the bad things Dixon had done. But in the eyes of these characters, it's enough. It won't be enough forever, and the anger won't be resolved. ""Anger begets anger"".

Also, Abbie Cornish was just Australian. She wasn't putting an accent on. She was just an Australian living in small town America.  
 [deleted] I was covering my eyes. The barrel at his face- I was sure he was going to shoot himself too, and that's one of the few things I avoid seeing onscreen if at all possible. And then the camera on the gun as he lays it down? The director was toying with us. Then, the way he put his hand on his sleeping mother's head, it called back his statement about blowing her head off. We don't really understand the man, or what's in his head and heart. Just one example of this movie's excellent, reality-based portrayal of traumatized, complicated people who are motivated by both love of self AND love of others, among other things. Another example (and maybe my favorite character) is the teenager who is justifiably furious at his mother for shoving the details of his sister's brutal last moments into his face and otherwise making his life miserable, yet is at his father's throat with a knife the instant he moves to hurt her. Someone commented above that the immediate shift there to comedy (the gf coming in, ""I need to use the restroom but if this is an inconvenient time- I can see this is an inconvenient time"") was tonally all over the place, or something. That was the point, and it was so refreshing to see an unpredictable screenplay. I loved it, despite the difficult-to-watch moments. I was impressed that the Chief was able to marry an Australian who was willing to move to podunkville Missouri. Stolen from another thread but I think this is very plausible:

""The soldier has no reason to confront Mildrid in the gift shop unless he was (A) involved in the murder or (b) friends with the Chief. Surely those are the only 2 possibilities? It's unlikely that he was friends with the Chief seeing as he was based in Idaho, meaning for the gift shop scene to make sense he must have been involved in the murder. Obviously, there was no DNA match, but when he was telling the story in the bar he mentioned that there was a group of them raping Angela. My theory is that the soldier was present but did not actively partake. This would dove-tail incredibly nicely with Mildred's speech to the Priest about how if you're in the gang you are culpable! This theory would add so much to this scene and explain the soldier character really well. We know he served in Iraq, so maybe his Commanding Officer covered for him, and could have even been the primary culprit.""

It's basically too good an explanation to not be the right one as it fits so well thematically with the film Strange casting. She's at least 15 years younger than Harrellson, and has a noticeable Australian accent. Oh well, sometimes that happens, maybe it took a previous divorce and a trip overseas for Bill Willoughby to find the love of his life, and then he gets cancer. Life takes strange pathways.

That aside, I thought she did well; she portrayed a woman very much in love with her very ill older husband, and then dealing with his suicide. That's not an easy performance for anyone. It's a dark comedy really, I laughed a lot. Cried too. Marks a good movie for me if you can experience several different emotions over two hours. I laughed when [spoilers ahead] Sam Rockwell smashed the window out of the front door, threw Red Welby out the window, and then punched his assistant in the face. Not really something you would laugh at in real life, but that scene was so amazing.  haha no it was hilarious. definitely a dark comedy that was intended to be humorous in places. the suicide note to his wife had me laughing and crying at the same time. think it's a first for me in a movie No this movie was definitely a dark comedy in a lot of places, plenty of dark humor.

 [deleted] It was distracting. And all that it would have taken was a single line from another character joking about Willoughby batting above his average or something like that.

Even more than the age difference, I was thrown off by how little chemistry there was between the couple. I didn't buy for a second that they were deeply in love. And her reading of that horrible ""you have a great cock"" line was just embarrassing. Not even just the age difference but where is a Missouri cop finding beautiful Australian model looking women to hitch up with?  A very odd casting decision. In my opinion, the most powerful moment of the movie was when [Mildred was reading the Chief's suicide letter and we learned that he was the one who funded the billboard.](#spoiler) Oh man I felt the opposite. I felt she was overplaying the ditzy girl and it pulled me out of the feel of the movie each time. The not-perfect accent didn’t help.  Biggest plot hole you missed: McDormand gets away with arson of a police station with a victim by offering the flimsiest possible alibi even though she is by far the most likely suspect and was at the scene of the crime. * Two of the three black people with speaking parts suddenly decide to go on a date after one is released from jail and not somehow angry at Mildred for being the reason she was arrested in the first place.  I agree with you a lot, actually your experience was pretty much exactly mine, but I think the theme of the movie and what it was trying to be about was redemption, with almost all characters fucking up big time in the beginning of the movie/before the movie starts and shows each characters attempts at retribution  I think it was done to show Mildred's flaws and/or to allow her and Dixon to come together at the end. She burned the police station because she thought Dixon, another cop, or someone defending them burned the billboards. When she learned it was her ex it made her realize she made a big mistake. 

If she didn't learn it was her ex that set them on fire then when Dixon came to her later on after he decides to change his ways it would have been out of character for her to listen to him the way she did.  
 Because Mildred's ex wants to move on from the tragedy of Angelas death and those billboards only serve to bring back the grief he feels. That's why he burns them.  I liked that aspect. I thought it made the film interesting. You're meant to think Mildred is right and the chief is wrong, but it turn out that he really did everything he could have, and what she wants is illegal and unfair to other people. She's a protagonist because we feel for her loss, but she's clearly flawed and not correct in her actions. 'Penelope said begets?'

I laughed more than I should've at that scene. Bcoz he was a soldier who raped a girl in Afghanistan. And justice over one rape case is justice over another. He's culpable.  i think it was suggested that Angela's real killer was his fellow soldiers and they've been doing this many times, whether in missouri or in afghanistan. the guy recognize the method and went to ""shut her up"" so that the whole thing wouldn't blow up. also explained how it was so hard for the police to crack this case because it was committed by pros.  I thought the point of the anger begets anger thing was to show that they sit here and make a point out of how stupid that girl is the whole time, and she says the truest shit. And she just got it from a bookmark, but shes looking at this situation more healthy than anyone else because she's still young and innocent and naive. Everyone else is too jaded and angry to even see it despite how much smarter they all clearly are. 

 I don't think she did, but I imagine that once she saw him, she'd be okay with the murder. The only way she could think that is if she saw that dude's license plate when he drove off, but I think she didn't since she was distracted by Woody Harrelson's wife.  Exactly what Ive been thinking and trying to say, youre more eloquent in your explanations though. You hit a lot of the problems with the movie, but that didnt even cover everything it was so frustratingly bad. 

Priest scene at the dinner table? Just a vehicle for Mildred to spew shitty dialogue. 


We also need to say the n word 3 times to portray Dixon's racism. 

The tonal shift with the dentist? Gotta show again how angry Mildred is. 

We need to show how the Ex really is abusive, so lets toss in physical assualt. That felt sooo out of place. And son was ready with a huge ass knife. THEN in walks ditzy and that long piece of dialogue was supposed to be funny/sarcastic/Emma Stone? Like you said, introduce laugh track and we will pick this table back up.  McDonagh isn't the best at writing women. He even jokes about it in Seven Psychopaths. For the most part, I agree with your criticism. I thought the script missed a lot of marks that McDonagh usually nails dead on. Most frustrating for me were probably half the lines of Lucas Hedge's character, notable the incredibly forced ""I'm depressed enough as it is"" and ""have you heard the news"". Cringed hard at those. Thank you, said everything I was thinking. I cannot understand the adoration for this, it's a total mess. Saving this comment and going to come back to it whenever I'm getting shit for not liking this movie over the next two movies, it perfectly sums up my thoughts.

I will be arguing for a long, long, time that Sam Rockwell's characters is one of the worst written in movie history. He's a literal asshole racist who nearly kills a guy who did absolutely nothing but his job to rent out some billboards, and just because he decides for 10 minutes to not a total dick we're supposed to come around on him. Hell no, that's not an arc it's a bullshit flip designed solely to fit the plot. Felt like the movie thought I was stupid, cannot understand how people are calling for awards recognition for Rockwell in that role. 

Most overhyped movie of the year by a country mile.  I agree with a lot of this; there were several points in the movie where something happened that was so ridiculously unlike how that scene would play out in real life that it took me out of the movie.  Remember when the Ex literally physically assaulted Mildred and the son held a knife to his neck to get him to let go? That scene is resolved by the ditzy new girlfriend basically making fun of the situation and (having just seen her boyfriend almost choke to death his ex wife) heads out to his car.  What!? I get how Mildred can be seen very unsympathetically, but a mother who is going through the rape/murder of a daughter might be prone to some rash decision making. My interpretation is she is going after the cops because the killer is still at large, making the cops the only obvious target for the displacement of her rage/blame (besides herself of course, that's another piece of the puzzle; perhaps she even wanted to get in trouble as punishment for a feeling of guilt or culpability).

As far as anyone who is complaining about Dixon changing suddenly out of the blue, you've gotta remember the guy almost died. His character does take a very sharp left turn, but a near death experience shouldn't be that wild of an explanation for something like this; just my opinion, but I don't understand how anything so trope-y can be viewed as unbelievable or unexpected. [deleted] See, this is why I think McDormand's character was not ever meant to be a moral character, but rather a vehicle to illustrate the motif of ""anger besets more anger"". There were really no truly moral characters in that film, besides Red (the advertising salesman). When he realized that Rockwell's character was in the hospital with him, any other character in that film would have responded with anger, which would only complicate and escalate the situation. 
However, instead, Red offers Rockwell's character a peace offering, the orange juice. I believe this event galvanized the change we see in the other characters. It was not that the characters were experiencing a moral redemption, but rather the violence that previously defined and guided them was mollified, thus breaking the cycle of anger besetting more anger. So, Mcdormand's character is still morally questionable, but he is making decisions based on thought and reason rather than violence and acrimony.  >In my mind she was in the wrong and she was bringing everyone around her down along with her. And the film did nothing to address this, not in any degree.

You are right. She was in the wrong. It doesnt matter though. This movie is about love and hate and revenge, and that means not every action needs or has justifications

 >Great movie. The greatness of the movie definitely comes from the acting and direction, as I do have issues with the script and character motives. I felt McDormand's character was morally wrong and some of her actions unjustifiable. Normally this would be okay, but the movie seemed to not have addressed this at all. Her case had no leads, there was nothing anyone could do; why would she burn down the police station? Stabbing the dentist? Wasting her money on those billboards? Like Woody's character said, the only way the case would be solved would be through sheer luck and ""stupidity"". And that's exactly what almost happened. The case was a dud. I felt the movie should have addressed McDormand's character's actions a little more. 
>
>In my mind she was in the wrong and she was bringing everyone around her down along with her. And the film did nothing to address this, not in any degree. But goddamn some of the scenes in this movie were perfect. 
>
>Great movie. Almost best picture worthy. 



She burned the police station down because she assumed they burned her billboards.

She stabbed the dentist because lost trust in n him after he tried to drill her tooth without any novocaine.

She bought the billboards because she perceived the police weren't doing enough.

Everything was retaliatory It isn't much, but I do bask in the scene where Peter Dinklage's character tells her off. I felt sorry for Peter Dinklage's character since he seemed to be the only reasonable one in the whole town. Couldn't agree more. Couldn't have said it better myself.  She was distracting and often times I'd try thinking how the hell she ended up in MO from Australia...   I totally agree. This movie rang hollow for me. It meanders about and doesn't really ""earn"" the character development. Dixon goes from nearly murdering Red to deciding to become a good detective in a matter of a scene or two.  I'm curious what you thought was undercooked. I was unhappy with the movie too, but for very different reasons. I didn't like how helpless the movie made life feel.
  
When the rapist first appeared in the gift shop, you just KNEW he was the bad guy. People in the theater were even whispering ""that's the guy!"". In the final scenes of the movie when Rockwell has his redeeming moment of heroism and collects a precious DNA sample - the very thing McDormand said she needed at the start of the film - I was so certain I knew where the movie was going... but I was ok with it, because I wanted to see the rapist punished.  
  
Then the chief says he's not the guy, and now I was SO certain it was a coverup or a conspiracy. It HAD to be! His superior officer lied for him! He's the guy, damnit!  
  
Then they're in the car and driving to take justice themselves, and even then they aren't certain they have their guy. The whole movie is one big lesson in grief and coping - how you can be SO SURE of something and SO eager for revenge... and you're left  wanting.  
  
That felt too real for me. It was super uncomfortable to experience that, and while I love me the film I do not think I could watch it again. It was a brilliant film that made me feel awful. Spoiler:

It's because the girl's case didn't get solved and the ending left unanswered. Earlier in the movie, Sam Rockwell's character said he got a complaint about the billboards from a dentist (which Francis McDormand didn't know, but that gave an initial clue to the audience).

In the dentist office, he is quite hasty to pull her tooth out. He mentions that he is a supporter of the sheriff. And then he ""forgets"" the novocaine. After he injects the novocaine and says to wait "" a few minutes"", he's ready to drill in about 10 seconds.

So yeah, she thought something was up. > did she think he was going to hurt her intentionally?

He was clearly intending to hurt her, and he very pointedly said he was a ""friend of Chief Willoughby."" And, it's actually SOP to numb the gums with a topical treatment before injecting novacaine, so that was another warning sign. The way he was talking to her made her question his intentions and the fact that he didn't ask if she wanted the novacaine.

Also, even though she didn't know about it, a bit before that scene, Dixon said that a fat dentist made a complaint about the billboards to the police. I think the fact that we don't get closure is perfect because none of the characters in the movie got closure of their own Here's my theory for that, I'm bias but I think it adds some great layers:

[The solder has no reason to confront Mildrid in the gift shop unless he (a) Was involved in the murder or (b) Friends with the Chief. Surely those are the only 2 possibilities? It's unlikely that he was friends with the Chief seeing as he was based in Idaho, meaning for the gift shop scene to make sense he must have been involved in the murder. Obviously, there was no DNA match, but when he was telling the story in the bar he mentioned that there was a group of them raping Angela. My theory is that the soldier was present but did not actively partake. This would dove-tail incredibly nicely with Mildred's speech to the Priest about how if you're in the gang you are culpable! This theory would add so much to this scene and explain the soldier character really well. We know he served in Iraq, so maybe his Commanding Officer covered for him, and could have even been the primary culprit.](#spoiler) I took it as... He is a rapist, who possibly thinks it's his right to be a rapist, and definitely has some kind of issue with women in general, hence being shitty to Mildred that she's trying to get her daughter's rapist/murderer found.  I love that show’s wacky sidekick. I like the episode when her head gets stuck in the railing.  Maybe it's just in her contract that she gets a cigarette puff at least once a minute I am a die hard Sunny fan and I have never noticed this. God...damnit. > I think his superior covered his ass for fear of it getting out that one of his men was a killer

The DNA didn't match either though. Maybe he just got a thrill out of harassing a mother of a girl that was raped and killed, seeing as he probably did something similar to another girl (or he didn't do anything and it's like the black cop said, he just gets off on people believing he did it) And really, he lived in Idaho. How could he have known the Sheriff? If he didn't know the sheriff, then what was the point of him going in and scaring her? I interpreted this as one of the takeaway messages of the movie. 

We are given easily perceivable / convincing arguments on boths sides about the suspect guy.

By that extension, the viewer is also culpable of ""begetting violance"" just because the viewer makes up his mind one way or another, without digging all the way down to determine the truth. I was laughing too hard during Rockwell's letter. Telling him that he could be a great detective if he embraces the calm as the police station burns around him might've been my favorite bit in the movie.  The suicide shocked me. I loved all the subversions in this film, these expectations each getting tossed thrown out. His character was excellent and as strange as it was to hear his English wife talk, it made me think of Harrelson as a younger police officer, working in a big city, meeting his wife and how they’ve stuck together through thick and thin, even moving to a small backward town like Ebbing...  That one had me second-guessing myself on whether it was supposed to be a joke. I was the only one in my theater who even kinda laughed at that one.  About polio I'm glad I wasn't the only on to think so. It was probably the most heartbreaking scene to me. 
 Them putting the table back to me was the funniest moment of the movie  I get the feeling all her toughness comes from years of abuse. Like the scars never truly healed so she put layer after layer of don't-fuck-with-me on them til no one could hurt her or dare confront her again. She became what she hated. Someone to be afraid of.  Three Billboards, American Made, The Florida Project, and Get Out. That's pretty incredible.  It took me the longest time to realise he was one of the kids on the bikes at the end of No Country for Old Men. Yeah, this, Get Out, what else?

He was fantastic in Byzantium a few years back  As a Martin McDonagh fan, I immediately assumed he was going to pour the glass of OJ all over those burns for the shock value. I leaned over to my boyfriend and said that and he just said “No, that’s not this character.”  Well, after the fire, cold might be good for him. Yeah I really hated his character at that point.  Still don’t see how he got away with busting two windows and beating two people inside of their own business. I was just filled with dread as that was going on. I thought he was going to kill Red. ""No one' ll think you're gay, and if they do, arrest them for homophobia.”

From Willoughby's letter to Dixon.

Either just a joke or acknowledging Dixon is closeted?  ""Homophobic people are gay people in denial"" is sort of the thought train here.

They are angry with a perspective like ""its a choice. Its wrong!""  People with the choice truther perspective...i mean just think about what you're most passionate social ideas are, whatever they are, they derive from your own experience...so if a guy ""chose"" to be straight, the logical perspective is he was born gay, but doesn't want to be, so in his experience, gay people faced his same challenge and succumbed to temptation, and they resent that. Murder on the Orient Express Have you seen In Bruges (also written by Martin McDonagh)?  There's a great bit about how Ray, Colin Farrell's character, would ""never hit a woman"" unless she had a weapon, then a woman comes at him with a wine bottle in a restaurant and he decks her.  That scene in 3 Billboards with the champagne bottle was a nice little homage to one of his previous films.  My whole theatre thought that she was going to get a champagne bottle across the face, for sure. She got it from a book...mark.  That and ""Or Mexico... and who would want that?"" were the biggest laughs in the theater.  > He had no character development or arc.

He didn't need to have one. The short monologue he gave right before walking out of the restaurant I thought was very effective in making Mildred realize she's kind of a shitty person. I think his character was necessary and Dinklage did a great job with it. Of course Dinklage is better than a role with a grand total of six minutes of screen time.

I think he did a great job of subtly fleshing out a very minor character in a very limited amount of time. My heart broke for him as he told Mildred off and walked out of the date, and at the same time I was thinking ""fuck yeah, good for you, dude."" Whereas I feel like with other actors I'd have been probably thinking more about what Mildred was about to do to her ex than tearing up over the plight of a minor character. 

I thought he (as well as the writing) made his character into more than just a plot device, but I could understand if someone disagreed with this.

PS ""six minutes of screen time"" was an exaggeration. I was just saying that he's in very little of the movie. He had no development because he was one of the ""good people"" used to contrast the shittiness of everyone else. He was kind and warm and called out Mildred for being the opposite.

He DID have a small arc though. We saw him pursuing Mildred, helping her at a critical moment(with the alibi), helping Dixon when he didn't have to, helping Mildred again out of kindness(holding the ladder), and then finally sticking up for himself and calling Mildred out on her shit.

He also had a great lines in his limited appearances. I would argue with you that once he walks out of the date, Mildred realizes once again that she isn't exactly justified with her actions either. She may have been through a lot, but she is still a pretty shitty human being and without Dinklage, I don't think that would have resonated with me as much. He also had depth in the way that Dixon pokes fun at his height in the bar but when Dixon's on fire he helps put him out without a moments hesitation. A very empathetic character. Not every character is meant to have character development or an arc, especially if they're only seeing 6 minutes of screen time. Every character *should* however have some point or purpose to the story. His being the one to hold up a mirror to Mildred and become self aware of her actions and/or mislead intentions. (Not to mention being the sole reason Mildred isn't accused of the fire) And you could argue that Dinklage's character is the sole reason that wine bottle didn't smash over her ex-husband's face directly after.  In full view of the new police chief. Well, he was immediately fired. That's about as much justice as a cop in the south is going to get. Because he's a cop Agree 100% with this, people changing was a major part of the movie so it’s fitting that they would change their minds on the way to Utah. 

Without the car scene I think the ending would somewhat undermine that aspect of the movie. That cop sure knew how to write suicide letters. Loved all three of them I’m not even in a relationship right now, but hearing that made me think back to past loves and strong connections on that level. Eyes definitely got watery at that part  And then you get the complete reverse of that when he coughs up blood on her. She goes full mother, full of fear for him in that one quick scene. Fantastic film. Isn't the line something like ""It wouldn't be as helpful after you croaked""

Hilarious!  Hey, congrats! Dear Mildred, Dead Man Willoughby here... I was  blubbering and then Chiquita started playing, so I cried more, AND THEN SAM ROCKWELL STARTS JAMMING, I was trying not to laugh too loudly. Outstanding.  In a book about polio Same. I thought it was real. :( It's a real deer 

http://mentalfloss.com/article/527652/10-fast-facts-about-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri
 Why not... just use a real deer? It was a real deer  You k ow it’s really funny, the first 2-4 shots of the deer look *really* bad, lighting and color were totally off. But they finish the moment with another couple shots of the deer walking away and it looked WAY better, almost real. But the first half of using it was like “oh they reeeally didn’t want to deal with a real fucking deer huh” I mean it could've been like a hallucination or a vision. idk.  Yeah, the scene with Harrelson and Dixon at the billboards does a subtle reveal that she died there, but I didn’t until just now connect the closeness of the house to the signs together with the location of her murder. It’s a fact that just makes me appreciate the movie even more now.  Oh God, I didn't think about that.  That's a plausible explanation but her accent was inconsistent in a way that I found pulled me out of the scenes she was in. Maybe she was playing an Aussie immigrant to the South? No I didn’t, what was it?? I was the last one to leave the theater too! Can’t believe I missed it While I agree that choice is a main theme in the movie, it’s always as the result of something concrete. The general trend is a character does something in anger, and the next character has a choice to continue with anger and snowball the process, or act with love. But there’s always something definitive that happened, even if the response is directed at the wrong person (such as Mildred thinking Dixon/police setting the billboards on fire and responding in kind). 

Based on this, it leads me to believe the rapist was actually a rapist, but not Angela’s. I’m not even sure any other character in the movie lied, so there’s no reason for me to believe a random character comes in spouting bullshit. The characters tend to be brutally honest with their words. Which is why I think the gift shop scene detracts from the film, because it’s so out of line with the rest of the movie. 

 Why did the last conversation with the daughter ring false to you? Based on everything we know about the characters, it seems completely like the type of argument the mom and daughter would have. They've probably had it several times before that night.  I kind of agree although I liked the deer scene
The ""hope I get raped""  was dumb.  It would have been more believable if she said "" I hope I get hit by a car or murdered""  instead of raped because that's just... I've never heard of an argument like that before to guilt someone into doing something.  Just didn't fit. 

The gift shop scene, Another guys explanation kind of fit that I'd rather believe is that the military was covering his involvement up and he hates that Mildred is bringing it up again,  which I like rather than some rando likes bragging about raping and setting girls on fire but totally isn't the killer. 

Also I didn't care for some of the dialogue and acting in some parts either.  I didn't like the actor who played Mildreds son.  But I liked a lot about the movie and the performances.  See what I mean? Look at what you have to do to find an explanation for why this guy existed in both scenes.

If we pretend the gift shop scene doesn't exist, then it's just a guy who happenstance ends up in Ebbing with a similar story that is coincidental - thus the twist. No need for the disrespected badass freak explanation, or power play explanation, or whatever. He's a rapist with a plausible backstory of soldier doing morbid things in Afghanistan.

> Maybe he is a rapist; but he definitely didnt kill anyone

He heavily implies that after raping the girl he set her on fire. How are you concluding he could be a rapist, but not a murderer? The complexities of how people deal with anger, would be one reasonable interpretation. Best people of color torturer  This movie does away with ""hero"" and ""villain"" pretty aggressively. We learn fifteen minutes in that the lack of arrests wasn't for lack of trying, so Mildred isn't exactly in the right with her actions. What about Sally Hawkins? [deleted] >Maybe that explains the dna not being his

I assumed the recently fired cop contaminated the DNA when he scraped it out from under his own fingernails. But an intentional coverup makes more sense. This movie is about power and who gets away with crimes. The case in the movie mirrors almost the exact circumstances of the real life rape and murder of the Janabi family in the Iraq war. Some American soldiers raped and then burned the body of a 14 year old 
 girl. Their immediate superiors tried to cover it up. The soldiers, one in particular started bragging about it when he got back from the war.  I laughed very loudly at this and NOBODY else in my theater did, it was super uncomfortable Also her insult to her ex-husband that ""she thought she smelled something"" before he upends the table was great  [deleted] I thought that line was more cute than funny... Probably the least dirtiest joke in the movie I’ve never seen a movie be so hilarious while also being so dark and serious.  And none of it felt particularly forced either. >subtle 
>I guess the rant makes sense if you already blindly hate all things religious, 

I'm Catholic and I go to church with my family every time I'm home (when I'm not at college)... As you can see I thought it was hilarious! Maybe I just didn't get offended.

 > That moment in the flashback when Mildred tells Angela ""I hope you get raped too"" hit me like a brick to the gut. 

I actually hated that line and I would have cut off the conversation right before that final exchange. Simply leaving it at McDormand being racked with grief over her being the reason her daughter was walking home that night is more than enough, we didn't need something so on-the-nose to top off what was a good scene. Agreed. I think the point of the mother feeling guilt would have been fine without that line. It was just over the top. Didn't feel natural or in line with anything else. you are why i dont go to the cinema I felt so weird laughing at his hungover walk with his high-riding belt wobbling over to him beating the shit out of Red >super cop

You say that like he Colombo-style tracked down and tricked the guy in the bar into confessing. All he did was grab a file and scratch a guy's face. His arc wasn't that he went from bad cop to good cop, it was that he went from not trying to trying. [deleted] I agree. I think Rockwell pulled it off so well that people didn't notice as much (Rockwell is a treasure, and should get more work), but yeah. Still one of the better movies this year IMO, but his transition was 180% and he was played waaay too stupid for comic effect in the first half of his ""arc"". It's actually one of the things about the movie that keep me from considering the movie ""great"" instead of ""really good"". I said this to someone else, but does he become a hero cop? He's still making terrible decisions. He and Mildred are chasing down a man on no evidence whatsoever. If anything, he's still the same ""take the law into my own hands"" person but he now has different motivation behind. If the audience is behind him (and Mildred) despite everything they've done, I feel like that's meant to be more reflective of the audience.  That and sitting in the burn ward for how many weeks it takes to heal second degree burns, with the man he took out all of his hate and anger on, who still despite all of this still showed him compassion and pity, despite all of the hate and pain he sent the other way. 

It did seem quick, but after years of feeling like an alcoholic fuckup living with his mom, trying and failing at being a respectable police officer, and finally getting his ass handed to him by a black officer (he's racist), some woman from town (he's sexist), and some dumb kid advertising fuck (he has low self esteem), his face is all fucked up and burned, he finally was able to quickly realize that his hateful ways were getting him nowhere, and he needed to change and be more compassionate to people. Australian.  It added depth for me, as self-conceived as it is. For me, I thought about Woody as a young cop, falling in love during vacation and how they’ve been through thick and thin in their marriage, even moving to a small town in Missouri to be the sheriff because it was an opportunity to advance in his career and give his kids a better life. 

Yeah, I get sucked into films.  I felt like Woody signed on to the film with the stipulation the actress who plays his wife has to be a smoking hot Australian chick.  Grew up in Missouri, in a town like Ebbing. To say there wouldn't be someone foreign there is a bit silly. My town of less than 500 had a mayor who's wife was Indian. Are there a ton of immigrants, no, but to say it's impossible is a really poor criticism.  LOL..what.  As someone living in Missouri, you'd be surprised by the amount of immigrants we have living here.  Try thinking outside the box. McDonaugh is a play write and all of his movies bring that with him. I think it’s a strength of his and I personally quite like dialogue that is “above” normal speech like Tarantino etc I felt this especially for Penelope’s scenes. In a movie that, for the most part, is firmly rooted in the gritty shitiness of real life, her intentionally stupid comments came off as quippy and rehearsed.  The problem is that the bar scene later works perfectly fine without the gift shop scene, and they seem to be separated by a decent amount of time too. So this same guy travels through Ebbing twice, once to torment Mildred and once to show off to some guy in a bar? It’s just a bit much to swallow This is definitely the best response. You might have just pushed the movie up higher for me. Thanks! Additionally, the bit that he was discussing in the bar happening around the same time as Angela's death, was happening during his deployment likely to Afghanistan. A subtle commentary on the sexual violence committed by soldiers? He did describe the encounter as a large group of men.  I unfortunately saw it coming once it was revealed that they had taken the daughters out of school. I know someone whose father did something similar after he was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's, and I figured it was exactly the kind of fucked up emotional beat that McDonagh lives for. Still, one of the more powerful moments on screen this year even knowing what was coming. I love that he left the gate open so the horses could graze and wander since he knew his wife probably wouldn't want to go out to the stables for a while. ""No more cunts in this house""

""Yeah there won't be any when she leaves"" That doesn't necessarily make it *good*. Yet another thing that greatly bothered me.  Not to mention she is half his age... but I digress. For the most part I really like McDonagh's dialogue, but holy shit, every line about Willoughby's cock/the couple's sex life was horrible. I kept looking for any reasoning the film had to keep those lines in there, but there really wasn't any.

That, and the super on-the-nose ""I hope you get raped"" line really stuck out in dialogue that was otherwise really well written. I loved that, and I loved Frances McDormand's face as she reads the letter. Woody Harrelson was amazing. McDormand is my favorite actress. I don't care how crazy the final act of the movie was. It was a movie about desperation and that really came through. Just peeping in on this thread now and yeah I absolutely could not get past this. Between that and the comment she made to the police chief, there is just no realistic way she would ever get off the hook like that.

I stayed fixated on that for almost the entire duration of the movie* afterwards.

I still think it was really good, but I felt like it could've been a lot more, especially considering how amazing some of the performances were. Yeah... she also gets away with assaulting the dentist (despite clearly having gone to the dentist) and the kids at the school too. 

 I don't think its about redemption. I think its about life being inconclusive most of the time. The killers of children aren't always caught. The racist cop isn't always a bad guy. The sheriff isn't always incompetent when arrests don't happen. Ex husbands sometimes stay with the bimbo. And people who in dark times want to lash out think better of it the next morning.

It felt like a snapshot of real life. Having the movie just end after an inconclusive line seals the deal for me on thinking that.
 I thought that was one of the stranger aspects of the movie. Very early in the movie, this fact is brought up: the chief is not some lazy idiot who gave up on her daughter. He did just about everything in his power to solve the case. But Mildred wants him to go farther and do something that's literally impossible (DNA test every man in town).

This seems to be a setup: though we were lead to believe Mildred is on a righteous crusade, the truth is that the crusade is entirely unfounded and Mildred is now mentally unwell.

One would expect this to be the throughline in the movie - people trying to help Mildred, make her understand what really happened and that she has to move on. Instead, it's as if the movie forgets that this thread was introduced and we continue to follow Mildred as if her billboards will accomplish anything.

Thus, whenever we see Mildred do something that's intended to make us cheer - like accuse the pastor of being a pedophile, or burning down the ""corrupt"" police station - we're actually witnessing the meltdown of a mother who's been mentally warped by her own grief. Feels emotionally inconsistent. That scene is a perfect example. We need to feel a real sense of dread for that scene to work. We need to understand that violence is a constant and real threat in Mildred's life. But as we reach the climax of that moment, Jar Jar Binks strolls in and tells a joke. It's so sloppy and frustrating. True. In a town of ordinary looking, weird people, the dwarf's common sense was overshadowed. I mean that seems pretty dismissive to say his redemption arc is “only 1-2 scenes” when those scenes have pretty heavy dramatic implications. I mean in those “1-2 scenes” he loses his job, reads a note from the person he admired more than anyone in the world asking him to do things better right before he literally walks through flames to then honor said persons request, and is then forgiven by the person he did attack even though he really doesn’t deserve it. Even though it’s only a few scenes that’s a lot emotionally for a character to go through and makes his arc totally believable, especially if you believe Willoughbys note that Dixon did actually mean well, and wasn’t as black and white as he’s made out to be early on in the movie.  I feel like this bleak reality that he's trying to portray is really turning off some viewers and making them think the movie itself is bad when it really just makes you feel bad. You said it perfectly  found the bird's reddit account That was my initial thought as well, but didn't he say during the bar scene that there were others participating in the crime?  So maybe the DNA was from one of his buddies that he mentions. I was under the impression that the new chief was just covering up for him since he was in the army. A little political game. a little late to the party on this, but that scene sort of reminded me of the type of people who start harassing families of school shooting victims or public tragedies.

Just people who are mentally off who see stuff on TV and want to become part of it. Ugh and the whole scene where he thinks he’s caught the killer - rather than jumping him, he gathers intel, he comes up with a plan, he figures out a way to get his DNA. The whole time I was just thinking “He’s listing to what Willoughby said.” There was a good juxtaposition to the situation, still, I felt bad because I don't believe Mildred would have gone through with it had she been aware of the change Sam Rockwell was about to go through because of that letter. I guess it was a little bit of dramatic irony.  Just FYI, Abbie Cornish (Harrelson’s wife in the movie) is Australian. She’s an interesting character for me, given that we’re supposed to mock Mildred’s ex-husband for dating a 19 year old but there’s also an obvious age gap in her marriage. 

However, the suicide note was one of the best pieces of writing in the movie. Holy shit, i didn’t think of that aspect of his wife. Damn...

That actress also did a fantastic job with the little she had. “It’s hard to know what to do...it’s hard to know what to do...”

Man, I’m tearing up just writing it haha you and me both . . . and then after I laughed, a couple people considered it for a moment and then laughed themselves. Or polo? Which is the one with the horses? Haha It just showed me how normal their whole system of abuse was. 

They didn’t run out of the house trying to get away, it was just “back to life” after Dad tried to beat the shit out of Mom again.  Don’t forget Twin Peaks! Same with Lucas Hedges. Manchester by The Sea, Ladybird and Three Billboards were his last 3 films. These young character actors are really breaking out.  He looked so familiar, but I didn’t realize he was the brother in *Get Out* until I looked him up. He plays such a different and more likable character! Look at that fuckin' bone. He was also in Twin Peaks this year. What do you mean? He was almost immediately fired for it, which in a lot of cases is the extent of the punishment for terrible actions by police officers. I've just been calling it ""Murder Train"" I have seen In Bruges!

But clearly forgot about that scene. D'oh! [deleted] Then he won a bunch of damn awards Especially since the scene shifts from him interrogating her pretty harshly, and her just giving him crap. Then he coughs up the blood and she immediately tries to take care of him. 

McDonagh can write characters, man. That has to be one of the most sudden changes in tone I've ever seen in a film. From giving each other shit to immediate dread. I felt my heart sink after the second it took for me to realize what had happened. There are several moments like that. People who have no reason to be kind to each other - being kind. Being human to each other despite the disagreement they had(or are having).

Mildred helping the Chief, Dixon saving the case file during the fire, Red bringing juice to Dixon in the hospital, Dinklage holding the ladder(""I didn't have to hold the ladder"").

 It wouldn't be as effective, after you croak, right? 

I think is what she said. So cold and harsh but true.  Thanks, stranger, we're stoked.  I'm a paraplegic and it took us almost a year of trying, so we're super excited.  Now hopefully the little one doesn't arrive until after Star Wars and The Shape of Water.  After she's born movies might be a little harder to attend. No, polo? Which is the one with the horses? It was real. Ignore these folk.  Wow. It was really bad. Shocked anyone thought otherwise Can't really train 'em I guess Hire the deer, hire the trainers/handlers, make sure the crew is protected from the deer and vice versa, get the deer prepped for multiple take, etc.

CGI may wind up costing more, but saves so much time and hassle. I’m pretty sure the deer in those last scenes (super tight shot, without Frances McDormand visible) was real, which is why it looked so real. The difference was so jarring that I couldn’t stop thinking  “Why didn’t they just use a real deer for everything?” It was just standing still, and deer raised in captivity aren’t scared of humans and could probably handle the brief interactions, especially with so many cutaways. It wouldn’t have to be perfectly trained like a dog. They could’ve thrown some feed on the lawn and let it graze during the scene.  That's what i took from it. She just wanted to see something beautiful in a hopelessly bleak situation. At one point the camera panned down to show an area of bur that grass in the shape of a body. So she definitely died there.  There was a fantastic shot of the billboards being seen outside the window or porch, I forgot which from their house. But there was a specific scene where it shows her staring out at those three billboards from her house.  I was just kidding :P. Sorry to get your hopes up! For me, it increased the stakes for Mildred, Dixon, and the audience. This *motherfucker* comes into her store to terrorize her? He’s the guy. He’s GOT to be the guy. We DEMAND he be the guy, because goddamnit we need our bow pinned on it. Yet, when he’s NOT the guy, it hurts that much more.  It was way too on the nose. Would've been better with something like ""I don't care what happens to you.""  To me at least it seemed like pretty canned dialogue to me. While most everyone in the movie insulted one another pretty often, I don’t think that line was ever crossed from saying “you’re an X” to “I hope (bad thing) happens to you.” 

I feel like there were more subtle ways of showing Mildred’s guilt than swinging a hammer at the audience’s head.   You've lived a relatively nice life Because he is making it up.  All of it. Its not a *similar story, its literally the SAME story.  he didnt rape or murder anyone;  he just read the town paper and decided it would get his rocks off to fuck with a grieving mother.

Every murder story has multiple people come out of the woodwork to say they did it even when they were 5 states over and in jail at the time of the killing.   Its par for the course in investigating a murder;  crazies want to be a part of the story, even if they have nothing to do with it. 

More than likely he didnt do anything to anyone (the only reason I say he may be a rapist is because that personality type usually is;  but more like domestic abuse rape, not attacking a random girl and killing her rape) .  

That sort of false confession happens pretty often with sensationalized  murders.  And it isnt uncommon that they are made to friends as a way of boasting like in the bar scene (a couple  of the guys who *confessed* to being the Zodiac did it that way; they were all later proven to have not done it, they all just had a sick sense of humor) .  ""I was telling her you can't say nigger torture anymore""

That got a good laugh out of me... This is not a good movie for people who get offended easily. Lol It really subverts expectations and you have very little idea what's going to happen. Fantastic movie. It's a film about catharsis, and the ways it can go so right and so wrong. The audience is rooting for Mildred, even though her actions ultimately get her no closer to justice for her daughter's death. She's on a warpath, willing to bowl over both good and bad people as a result. 

By the end, it's unclear if she's made a positive difference on her community. Yet it's no less satisfying. Shape of Water seems to have lost a lot of steam but maybe the theatrical release will help a lot. Me too. It also felt so fucking real. I have absolutely made a comment like that without understanding the moment I was in and had to follow it up with some variation on, ""fuck. I was just doing a bit. Sorry"" Nah, the audience *exploded* with laughter at mine.

Then again we are British and we use that word more casually. I never saw the red band and the context is totally different from what's implied in the trailer.

The shocking level of awkward swearing paired with the lingering feeling that she should just let it go at that point really changed the whole scene for me. It was a little scary and certainly not as funny. It's kinda better that way, imo. I purposefully stay away from watching trailers and saw it for the first time and I was rolling with laughter.  McDormand is a genius.   There weren't too many laughs in my theater I wasn't offended. I'm a Baptist and I think it's disgusting what the Catholic church does to little boys. That being said, the rant was still really bizarre and poorly written. I agree. Loved the movie, but that just made me roll my eyes and seemed to be for shock value more than anything else. I get it, the family cusses and calls each other cunt, they're not exactly the Brady Bunch. Still doesn't make it believable that Mildred, or any character really, would ever randomly shout ""I hope you get raped too."" I'm sorry, I don't buy that.  Did he think himself a hero when he beat up a guy in custody because he was black?  Did he think himself a hero when he beat up Red for possibly being tangentially related to Willoughby's death?  This is a guy that spends the first half of the movie as the epitome of stupidity and evilness.  There is no transition for his redemption.  Reading the letter is enough to cure him of his racism, and 20 points to his IQ, and turn him from the films primary antagonist into the secondary protagonist.  She's indeed Australian, but her native accent is now so faded that it sounded like a bad British accent. Really took me out of the movie. She was quite miscast in my opinion.  It's really blowing my mind to see that Americans hear that character and all seem to interpret it as English. Sucked in sure, but you aren't wrong. I think a lot of the early scenes of the film play with the audience's perception of Missouri. I admit that I really thought the movie was painting a picture of a rural, redneck town with a hick Sheriff and his violent band of goons. And while that's not entirely incorrect the movie does an amazing job of reminding you that there's so much more to the world than a closed City set.

Who says that a sheriff couldn't meet and fall in love with a younger girl from another country? The scenes that we see him share with his family are full of genuine tenderness and love. He's a hard talking man but aside from a foul mouth he seems to be an amazing father and husband. Doesn't seem so far-fetched to me that a successful police officer could catch the eye of a pretty and charming girl 10 years earlier.  The Director works with the same actors a lot. So he got the girlfriend from 7 psychopaths for this movie. The canadien was a policeman. woody and Sam also from 7 psychopaths. Sure there is more. I normally enjoy it as well, it just didn't seem to fit here I think the implication was that he was in town the the whole time, but I agree that too much time seems to have passed for that to be the case. 

The gift shop scene probably should have been cut.  [deleted] I thought it was ""Are you leaving?""

But it's been a couple weeks. > ""No more cunts in this house""  
> ""What, are you moving out?""  
 That was fucking SAVAGE. She was drunk. My wife talks like that when she’s drunk. She don’t quote Orson Wells, but she does talk a bit different.  I was also annoyed by this until I remembered the dentist was about to pull out her tooth with no novocaine. Without even EXAMINING it. Then when he did give her some he waited all of 5 seconds to start. He was trying to hurt her. She's ""reading a book about polo"" but cannot remember if it's called ""polio."" Truly a terribly written character. well put. I see what you (and the movie) are getting at I just wasn't particularly convinced. if Dixon had ""just"" assaulted Red or done something less heinous than essentially attempting to murder him, i'd be slightly more inclined to believe the abrupt turnaround. but he threw him from a second storey window for chrissakes. this is a completely unstable person with basically no moral compass.  It's heavily implied he and his squad were all doing some fucked up shit to girls wherever they were stationed.  I think he said they just liked to watch  She wouldn't have gone through with it if there was a person in the station. That's why she called several times.  [deleted] I felt like her accent was all over the place. I guess it makes sense for a displaced Aussie in America, having an accent that sounds both Aussie and American in different places.  He accent was very strange to me. I was thinking South African not Australian. Yeah but her and Woody's characters were so clearly in love and in sync. Equal footing. John Hawkes's character was all about dominance and superiority and aggression, being in control. Dating basically a kid. The son was glad the father was there too in the first place. When he heard his car he was excited. This movie was great. Not sure which dark comedy I liked better. Three Billboards or Phantom Thread, but phantom thread was more of a romance one  For me, it just seemed “right”. 

There are people out there in the real world like this. Flipping tables and pulling knives, then letting the moment pass, being immediately remorseful and then continuing with breakfast.

 What else are they going to do? If he’s have stormed out or if she flew off the handle, it somehow would seem less of a realistic reaction to me. That’s just life in some cases.  The Golden Globes certainly did... Timothee Chalamet with Lady Bird and Call Me By Your Name too!  Was he fired for that?  Or was he fired for being a total dick to the chief of police. ""That's for John Lennon!"" It goes from ""we're arguing about this issue but both know we aren't enemies"" to ""screw the billboard stuff, your health is important"". I really loved that they didn't play it for a laugh and Frances immediately goes to help. Him saying he didnt mean to and her saying she knows as they both realize what is going on was touching Upvote for priorities. But for real congrats, excited for you! But it looks terrible and takes viewers out of the movie Now that you mention that, I think you're right.

Angela: ""I hope I get raped!""

Mildred: ""I don't care what happens to you.""

The original is just too much... which lessens the believability and then the emotional impact. I totally get what you're saying, but honestly, to me, it came across as real and genuine based on the language they use in their home. It'll be a polarizing scene, for sure, but for me, it had the effect that was intended. Though I can completely understand it bothering some viewers as being heavy-handed. I think this holds true with kind of the theme of the movie, too.

Hayes puts up billboards blaming Willoughby, but it was out of his control.

Willoughby kills himself and Dixon thinks it's because of Hayes so he attacks Welby, it had nothing to do with either of them.

Billboards burnt down and Hayes thinks it was Dixon so she lights up the police station, it was her ex-husband.

Dixon overhears this guy in the bar so he and Hayes go after him, but he didn't actually do anything.

------

I might be missing some, but it seems to me that a lot of what happened had to do with people reacting without all of the information. I think the guy lying about it and facing repercussions would fit with the rest of the film.

Although I'd like to think that they've grown from all the jumping to conclusions and didn't actually follow through, but obviously that's left up to the viewer. (Which is not to say I don't want that guy to get fucked up). The line about if we got rid of every cop who is racist, we'd have 3 cops but they would hate faggots. Got a good laugh out of me Her face during this sequence was sooo good.  There was an old couple groaning In front of me at the alter boy gang scene And the fact that they say cunt I think at least 3 or 4 times  I agree. Carthasis is what the last scene was about (to me). They weren't going through with murdering a potentially innocent scumbag. 

It's like writing a letter to someone about how much you hate them and never sending it. You've gotten lucky with family, I suppose. Family members really do say the most hideous shit to each other. Especially when they are exhausted, and angry, and they're so used to screaming battles that words don't feel like they matter anymore.

And then later on, you feel horrible. When it's too late to do anything about it, and you said those words. [deleted] She's 21 years younger than Woody Harrelson. I know Hollywood does that shit all the time, but it felt especially egregious in this.  I know, I was just making a joke. I disagree, because now Mildred has a potential face to put to her daughter’s rapist. If her and Dixon do make it to Idaho, and Dixon points out that that is the guy he overheard talking in the bar, that bitch is dead. Yeah, he says “what, are you moving out?” Oscar Wilde!!! God damn I’m stupid. I was wondering why she kept calling.  Ohhhhhh, right! I was caught up in the letter and didn't realize why she kept calling the station. Thanks!  [deleted] ""You heat da kinadin?"" ""Ya yankee fucking cunt"" 100% agreed. I also love that he singles out that issue in his suicide note. He says “I deeply regret not being able to find your daughter’s killer, and a lot of people in the town are going to think the billboards is why I did what I did, but it wasn’t.” Or to that effect. I really enjoyed his note to her.  Thank you!  As soon as we found out the due date I kept on joking that the baby better wait until after Star Wars or I was going to go see it without my girlfriend.  I'm amazed at how many of my friends and family thought I was serious.  I mean, c'mon you guys, I'll go see it again with her too... Meh, it didn't bother me that much. Also, fuck deer. They don't deserve our money. You thought it was too much? I feel like with the whole kind of culture right now, ""I hope I get raped"" is a pretty easy thing to come to your mind. And then in turn, ""I hope you get raped too"" in response is a super easy comeback, that she wouldn't even have to think about. It seemed really believable to me. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a loving household, but I know enough people who weren't that that dialogue was 100% genuine to me. He interacts with the new police chief after the letter, who is black. also theres the two black people in the bar that try to help him but he doesnt really interact with them Someone else above me pointed out that the age discrepancy is there to draw comparisons between the Sherrif and Mildred's ex-husband. The sheriff's wife may be considerably younger but they have an amazing relationship as evidenced by the scenes we see him share with his family. Mildred's ex-husband's wife is a very sweet girl whose age isn't the issue even though that's where Mildred piles on. True. Personally, I don't think they're going to make it to Idaho. They're expressing ambivalence about it before they even drive off and I imagine they turn back before the day's over.  Also chief got insulted by Dixon right after the beating. Said ""Fuck you looking at"" to him right before he entered the station  I don't know I could never say that to my daughter. But then, I'm no Mildred. ",1
131,"Anyone think it was intentional that he was freed by picking cotton? The scene where he meets everyone at the party. Their conversation with him were them vetting him to see if he was what they wanted like the white guy and his golf game or Eastern European lady asking about the sex and the winning bidder wanting Chris for his photographer's eye. Peele really hit a grand slam with this. ""Man, I told you not to go in that house.""

This film had one of the best audience reactions I've experienced, without annoying me at all. I feel like the film wanted to take the audience on a ride and wanted you to do what a classic horror film does. Interact and just have a fun ass time. 

I can't wait to see what Peele does next! He solidified his writing/directing chops with me the second those end credits hit. Most unrealistic part of the movie was that everyone used Windows phones.  Redbone was perfect for the opening of the movie.  So I take it the skinny black guy at the party wore that hat to cover up any scars from his brain transplant? Also, the groundskeeper wore hats as well, if I remember correctly. Are we all forgetting that Andre is still a sex slave? Did anyone else catch his reaction upon seeing the teacup video when he put the cotton in his ears? I thought this was a nice, subtle hint to the viewer.
Whenever he's been hypnotized by the teacup up to that point, his physical body gets locked into a trance. This time, he goes limp. It's because he knows the teacup takes him out of the world, but doesn't know what his outward physical reaction is. He just assumes it's passing out. He's faking the hypnosis and putting on a show for whoever might be watching, but it's not correct. Luckily, no one is around to catch it. My husband brought up an interesting point that I didn't see here. 

When all the guests arrive, the groundskeeper and Georgina greet them out of their cars. Rarely would a housekeeper greet guests but because they are the grandparents and it is THEIR party, they were greeting.  

EDIT: Photo Evidence - look how happy she is to see him! http://m.imgur.com/a/Beyhm What I love about this movie is that when you break down the premise of the movie it's almost like a comedy skit turned into a horror film. White people taking control of black people's bodies is a skit I could totally see on Key and Peele   

Initially when I saw the trailer it looked like a real departure for Jordan Peele to do, but watching the movie it just made perfect sense that he would write this. Really loved this film and I hope it succeeds at the box office  Does anyone else think that Rose's family was so insistent that Chris stop smoking cigs because cigs do a lot of damage to the human body (which is what he was later auctioned off as)? Rod= MVP.

That is all. Anyone else's theater burst into applause when the car door opened and it read ""Airport""? I don't know if it's been mentioned, but I found it fascinating how the girlfriend died bleeding out on a cold road. It's funny that Chris described this as being his mother's death some odd hours ago.  I dead honest they were going to go a step further and say Obama was actually a white guy. Her dad saying he would have voted for him for a third term. It would have been great if this conspiracy went ALL THE WAY to the top. Just noticed that when the dad (Dean) said ""We hired Georgina and Walter to care for my parents, and when they died I couldn't bear to let them go"" he meant his parents and not Georgina and Walter. Love the subtle bits of dialogue in this movie. This movie is worth seeing in the theater for audience reactions alone.

The writing had so many subtle hints. Like, when Rose mentions in passing that the basement is sealed due to ""black mold."" In the basement, black people's bodies are used as molds (a hollow shell) for white people to use.

Edit: it was the dad, not Rose Chris's rampage towards the end of the movie was one of the most satisfyingly badass moments I've seen in a *long* time.

Every other part of the movie was great too. Really appreciated how it defies a lot of common horror tropes, and how almost every element is tied back in at a later point. Okay but why are we not talking about how creepy it was when Chris went upstairs and everyone just stopped talking.  Did anyone else's heart drop when Chris' voice kinda cracked begging Rose for the keys? Pure dread right there. I sure hope Chelsea Peretti's family knows how to take a joke!  I turned to my husband after Georgina said ""tattletale"" and said they are Skeleton Key-ing their asses.


I loved how they played with the tension of it being actually threatening versus being awkward versus him thinking it was something and it wasn't. 

The scene where he finds the picture box was chilling since that really clinched that she was in on it the whole time. 

The only part I would have changed was if his friend had Sid the dog in the back seat of his TSA car. 

Edit: fixed her name (it's Georgina says IMDB). Anyone else like how in the beginning Rose said that her dad won't chase Chris out of the house with a shotgun but at the end she did.  Something I thought was really interesting was when Rose back-talked the cop about Chris giving him his ID she wasn't really doing it out to stand up for him, she was trying to keep a paper trail of them being together and on the way to her parents. 

This movie was so great.  Guys, it stands at 127 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with a 100% score. Impressive stuff.  

EDIT: the first and only person to give it a rotten review is Armond White of the National Review. It stands at 143 reviews, 99% score. I don't think Peele's getting enough credit on the thriller side. He's literally spent decades either training for, writing, directing, or performing comedy and made one of the decade's scariest mainstream horror films not by James Wan.  I just realized that the reason the groundskeeper (grandpa) runs so much is because the grandpa wanted to have a fast, black body because he lost to Jesse Owens. can we collectively agree that we all need a friend like Rod My goodness. What a film. I really hope this boosts Jordan Peele's chance of directing more films. I can tell the direction was just incredible. You know, if you think about it...this entire situation is all Jesse Owens' fault since he beat their grandfather and sent him off on his ""I'm gonna steal black people and transfer our brains into their bodies"" tangent afterwards  I though it was interesting how the art dealer said he didn't care about the color of Chris' skin and wasn't racist, rather he wanted him for his artistic ""eye"" that God gave him. It's like how many people supported slavery but thought they weren't racist bc they thought blk people were created by God for physical labor.  I laughed so hard when Rod scratched out ""magic"" as a possibility. So good. Just saying ""Magic isn't real."" under his breath. PAID FOR THE WHOLE SEAT
ONLY USED THE EDGE OF IT I don't know which is worse, getting stuck in the sunken place or having to watch your body fuck a really old woman in the sunken place The scene at the end where it seems like the cops showed up took the wind out of me. Police showing up at the end is such a well worn ""everything is okay now"" trope in horror and the way it was flipped was brilliant. Just because of the color of this guy's skin suddenly that very familiar scene turns into a gut punch (until we find out it's the motherfuckin' TSA).  The fact that he literally PICKS COTTON from the chair and it ends up saving him... so much subtle brilliance in this movie As soon as I heard redbone, I knew I was in for a ride.  Oh man, when Allison Williams is just sitting there, eating Froot Loops. CHILLING. I like how the cop is supposed to be a dick for asking for Chris' ID, and we love Rose for defending him, when in reality she just didn't want the cop to see the ID, because when his name came up on a missing persons report it would be tied back to her.  [deleted] Anyone stirring their tea more than three times around me is getting laid the fuck out. The most telling moment for me in this film was that I found myself more terrified of the prospect of [the police man from earlier being the one to roll up on him at the end rather than the actual horrors that were going on inside the house](#spoiler) I think it was a testament to how black people in America face true terror everyday from the legal system and not some crazy household. This movie exceeded my expectations in every way and that final scene really drove home the message of the film. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but maybe not considering it's Jordan Peele. But in regards to Jeremy and Chris' discussion about MMA.

[Jeremy scoffed at Chris taking judo lessons as a kid and explains that jiu jitsu is better. Why? Because it's like chess, you have to think three steps ahead. So fast forward to their fight in front of the doorway. Chris is desperately trying to stab Jeremy in the leg but can't reach him. However, he notices as soon as he gets the door open Jeremy kicks it shut. EVERY TIME. So Chris thinks three steps ahead and tries one last time to open the door, knowing that if he does then Jeremy will stick his leg out where Chris is then able to stab it.](#spoiler)

I just thought that was a really smart callback to their dinner conversation.

Edit: Super honored that Jordan Peele mentioned my comment in a recent fan theory breakdown he did for [Vanity Fair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBvcngHRTFg&feature=youtu.be&t=6m38s) Scariest movie I've seen in a long time. Really thought this was going to be mostly comedy. Holy fuck no. 

Every detail mattered in this movie. I'm very critical. When he had the short talk with the blind guy, I really was irked that it was filler. Nope. Holy Fuck nope. I'm like on the verge of tears. As soon as you think you have the plot figured out, there's a whole new layer. Bravo Jordan. I'm sleeping with the lights on because I'm afraid of white people, and black people that might be white people. Only thing I can trust is the TSA  I have never thought ""what the fuck is happening"" so much during a movie. So many creepy/unsettling moments. The close-up shot of Georgina's face while they're talking in the bedroom made me so uncomfortable, and I loved it When Chris was taking pictures of Georgina...and she was looking in the mirror. I was trying to figure out why she was touching her hair in that weird way...like she was confused and didnt know what to do. After the reveal I realized ""this bitch don't know how to do her hair! None of them did actually...the men shaved just theirs."" 

It takes a lifetime of blackness to understand how to manage our hair aaaand make it look fly.  One awesome little thing that I think is going unnoticed: When he's tied up in the basement, the buck head is staring at him. An empty husk of a former creature, stuffed, and used in an ornamental fashion. He's staring into his destiny. If Logan had said, 'DEADASS, GET OUT!!', like a true dude from Brooklyn, Chris would have remembered him instantly. Lol You know what I think made us really connect with the movie that I think people aren't giving enough credit to? Rod. He was the voice of the audience. He would literally say what I was thinking almost every time and I think that allowed a whole other level of immersion to the film. Let's give a round of applause for Rod.
 
""How'd you find me?""

""I'm the T. S. Motherfucking. A."" I love how at first it seems like the cop is racially profiling Chris, but the real reason he might have been asking for his ID was because he was aware of the number of missing black people in the area. I've never seen so many white people rooting and cheering for a black dude to strangle a white girl. ""I'm T-S-muthafuckin-A. Consider this situation handled."" Oh man just put it together on ride home. The grandfather's ""crowning achievement"" was when he got beaten by Jesse Owens. So he then spends the rest of his life trying to find a way to put his brain into a more genetically superior body. 

Fucking brilliant.  You know we're both TSA so eventhough you're detectives we have like the same training. I mean sometimes we even know more than you do. But that's another story.  This was a whole new experience for me. I've never found myself laughing my ass off, then tense/scared the next, and questioning my own perceptions on racism. Hats off to Jordan Peele!  Holy fuck this was such a great movie. It was so smart, relevant, funny when it needed to be, and scary when it needed to be. There literally wasn't anything in the movie that I would change. 

The ending when we see the police lights I was thinking ""Fuck fuck fuck. He's gonna get shot after all this."" And I was so relieved when it was his friend from the TSmothafuckinA. 

10/10 In my theater at the scene where Rose holds up the keys and says she can't let him leave, someone shouted, ""Fuck, you can't trust white bitches!"" and my whole section started cracking up. 

I love that scene because he already knows she is in on it and is pretending to fumble for the keys but his only play is to not let her know he knows. The tension there is perfect.  Everyone has been mentioning the ""Black Mold in the basement"" comment, but no one has mentioned that Dean states ""There's a piece of my mother in this kitchen"" and gestures directly to Georgina (his mother's host body).  When Rod was outside the airport trying to call Chris, there was an announcement in the background for flight 237, a number referenced in a lot of movies (originating as the most haunted room in The Shining)  Another realization: Rose was a great example of white people that are ok with arguing against racism/defending black people on their terms, but if a black person mentions their own experiences of racism/micro aggressions/discrimination, they'll say they're lying, exaggerating, or misunderstanding the situation. 

Rose did that throughout the first two acts. She appeared to defend him to the cop and she launched into the diatribe about how embarrassing her family was, but whenever Chris tried to express to her what was bothering him, she dismissed it -- and THEN made it about herself when he said he wanted to leave. ""Oh so you want to go without me?"" After this movie, black dudes won't be dating white women for at least a year.  Something my boyfriend pointed out but I don't know if it's been mentioned is during the tour the dad says they had to lock the basement becuse of a ""black mold problem""... well they are literally molding black people down there Gotta love seeing a white girl wearing a white shirt drinking milk through a black straw.

Oh the imagery!  The second I heard the siren and the chick from *Girls* was asking for help, the whole audience literally began yelling angrily at the screen.

Then Williams popped out and the audience burst into cheers.

Peele, you goddamn bastard, you almost had me.  [someone pointed out to me that Rose was so called unaware that the party was that weekend, but she was wearing red/black and so were all the other guests....] As a man in a 6-year deep interracial relationship... it makes you wonder, ya know? I thought the ""micro-aggression montage"" was hilarious and poignant at the same time.

My theater was so into it, what a great experience. Loved it. Okay I'm no movie aficionado but at the beginning of the movie he watches the deer struggle and ultimately die. Then later when he's strapped to the chair the deer head ""watches"" him struggle but he ultimately lives. That has to mean something right? 

*Hits blunt*  ""You know I can't give you these keys, Chris"" is straight HAL 9000 shit. Get out is like Atlanta combined with Wicker Man The scene that shook me the most was when Chris walked up the stairs and everybody in the house immediately stopped talking to listen to his footsteps. Such a brief moment but so bizarre.  Okay so the people who had already been transferred. They were acting weird because they were pretending to be black ? Because they are acutaly the grandparents or the lady's husband, but they can't talk an act like who they really are because it would be obvious am I right ?  I haven't seen anyone talk about this so far, so I wanted to elaborate on the aspects of this movie that struck me the most: 

1. Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of Chris is what makes the final act so impactful. His demeanor is delicately balanced between terrified and *unsurprised* because he is a man that has been taught throughout his life that he should expect to be endangered, betrayed, used, and exploited because of his blackness.  While fighting to get away, he gives the distinct impression of a man who is just really fucking tired, because, as said in the film, he has been told to expect this. He plays a man who has already learned to adapt to constant implicit and explicit threats based around his race and it is chilling to see exhaustion playing on the face of a character who would typically be portrayed as panicked. Notable is the fact that the horror cliche ""why are you doing this"" line never comes out of Chris's mouth--in fact, when he's asked if he has any questions, he doesn't say anything. He knows why they are doing it; he's spent his whole life learning why they were doing this. 

2. The Armitages are a perfect construct to represent the complicated history of whiteness within America. The fact that, while they stand in a beautiful mansion on an expansive plot of land surrounded by their trophies from world travel, that they still make a point of lingering on the fact that a black man beat grandpa in the Olympics is so striking; the focus on the few things they don't have or didn't win while living in complete comfort. The irony of a family making the argument that black people have it great in the modern day US while they take bids from people trying to buy him is a very simple and direct way to broach the delusions that many white Americans have constructed to avoid discussions of the real problems that center on race and racism that are occurring today. They actually believe that black people are winning while they exploit black people to increase their wealth and connections. 

3. It so beautifully forces the audience to face the way white people are given the benefit of the doubt. You are encouraged to make excuses for Rose throughout the whole movie until you literally have no other option but to accept that she was in on it. This is followed shortly by the cop car scene, which I firmly believe is a perfect moment in film. The unexpectedness of it takes your breath away in part because without realizing it the film as broached the topic of police brutality. It introduces the cop car in such a way that you instantly have to face what you know and have always known is going to come next: the cop will shoot Chris because he is a black man covered in blood standing over the body of a white woman who is begging for help. And in so doing it makes you face ALLLLLLL of those viral videos of police brutality towards black men, because you now realize that, despite the fact that you know Chris is the good guy and that you know Rose is evil, you also know that in a real world scenario, Chris would be the one to end up dead.  I've read through a lot of the comments, and noticed no one has mentioned how Jordan Peele, instead of going after the presumably easy target, the right winged republicans, he instead writes the bad guys as liberals. I found that aspect of the characters interesting.  This was such a great movie. My favorite part was when he uses the deer head at the end to kill the dad when the dad was talking shit about deer in the beginning.  My favorite part I don't see a lot of people talk about is [the part where Rod calls Rose and you can see her talking. In the parts where the camera is on Rod she sounds genuinely concerned and worried, but when the scene flips to Rose, she stills sounds the same but her face is just dead serious and pure evil. It was chilling](#spoiler)  All of the (white) attendees at the party showed up in black cars. Doesn't it seem a bit symbolic of how they were in the business of using black people as ""vehicles""/vesicles? If chris didn't stop to pick up gma he would of passed his friend on the highway and she would have killed the friend. I thought it was funny how Rod and Chris knew Logan through friends. Made me think of the stereotype that all black people know each other.  Almost every single statement made in the film comes back to tie in perfectly and add an additional layer making it that much more nuanced. Brilliant writing.  Did anyone noticed that they focused on Chris's body at the beginning of the movie?

I literally thought "" what a specimen of a man.""

After watching the entire movie I'm disturbed by my own train of thought. I can't stop thinking about this movie. The fact that he had to pick cotton to stay alive. 

All these fucking layers. This is one of the smartest most satisfying horror movie ive seen in a long time. I thought the hypnosis scenes were phenomenal.  When the mom first said sink in he just went through the bed was so visceral  It was REALLY sad when William ""grandpa"" killed himself... I thought he was going to be saved... that really got me  I haven't been in a movie theater full of cheering and clapping for the protagonist during the third act of the film in years.  I loved this movie. One of my favorite parts was when Rod was on the phone with Rose. His TSA training came through! I understand why at the very beginning she made such a fuss about not having Chris give the cop his ID: she doesn't want his name taken down with local authorities because if the plan worked out, people would be asking about him being missing and the search could maybe somehow make its way back to that cop or police department.

The layers just keep peeling back. The theater I was in started cheering at the end! Definitely a movie I want to watch again. A lot of little foreshadowing moments that keep coming to me the move I mull it over. I really enjoyed the intelligent way he got out of the house after being captured. There wasn't any deus ex machina to rescue him, no friend coming through at the last moment like I expected. He used his wits every step of the way (with the exception of taking ""Georgina"" after hitting her with the car). The cotton in his ears (though taking it out after one use seemed stupid, like he found a defense to the mother's hypnotism, but he pulled it out after one use? He was just lucky he got to the teacup in her office before she did!

But then getting Jeremy to bring his leg up to shut the door so he could stab him. Brilliant. I couldn't figure out what he was trying to do.

As for him looking at the photos of Rose and then still seeming to trust her when he tried to leave, I think people forget that he loved this girl, and probably didn't want to believe she was involved. However, his yelling at her was the indication that he was coming to accept that she was. Jordan peele is a fucking genius. I LOVED this movie. It was incredibly creepy in a way that really gets under your skin, but the funny moments were great as well. Also, some of those kills were awesome. One thing that confused me a bit maybe someone could explain.

[So what was with the way everyone was acting?  Why was the girlfriend the only one who was able to act normal?  I mean if they're all part of this evil plan, why is the brother picking fights and acting really hostile towards him? Why is everyone so weird and yet the art dealer is able to act totally normal? And most importantly, why are the black characters acting like zombies when we know it's actually the other white people who are really controlling them? Like the Grandma and Grandpa are in the maid and groundskeepers bodies but the only time they act like themselves or when they're trying to kill him.](#spoiler)

Also a cool thing that occurred to me as I was walking home.

[The grandpa was controlling the groundskeeper and he was constantly running as an exercise, and I remembered how he was beaten by Jesse Owens in the Olympic qualifying race. The dad said he almost got over it. I wonder if he initially came up with this whole plan because he resented the fact that a black men beat him and he wanted to be in a black man's body.](#spoiler) Oh my god. I just realised that the random Asian guy was asking Chris if there were advantages or disadvantages to being black because [he was thinking about trading his Asian body for Chris's black body](#spoiler). So weird. Reading through this thread is blowing my mind. What an incredibly thought out movie.

Another connection that I haven't seen pointed out is when the Asian guy asks Chris what it's like to be black, Chris bounces the question to the other black guy who makes some excuse but the truth is he can't answer the question because he's actually an old white dude who just became black. Lotta mad white people in here (I'm white) saying it's racist against white people. It's the furthest thing from the truth. Jordan Peele is actually using ""characters"" that admire black stereotypes so much that they want to be them. He's saying that even ""good racism"" as in calling all Asians smart is still racism. You're not getting to know a person as an individual Wow. That was really, really good. Suspenseful, good twist, you never really knew what was going to happen. Awesome film overall. That Grounds keeper *sprinting* scene is so perfectly crafted and alluded to that it took me a hot second leaving the cinema. The grandfather wanting to one up Jesse Owens!  Underrated line from Rod very early in the movie

""Geriatrics are taking over.""  The smirk on Rose's face as Chris was strangling her was heartbreaking to see as a black man. But when Chris backed off when he saw her smirking, I was relieved as hell. My theater applauded at that part. Did anyone see the irony in that the film displays both white and black racial stereotypes. When Chris is asked, ""What's your sport? Golf...?"" He responds ""basketball."" Chris reaches out to the black man at the party with a fist bump. Saying he thought Obama was the best president we've had.

Peele could've gone the obvious, cliche route, where the white folks in the film assumed racial stereotypes of the black man, e.g. if Chris is assumed to like basketball, and he responds that he likes ""hockey, not all black men like basketball."" But the opposite is in play here: Chris is full of black stereotypes. Peele is an equal opportunity stereotyper.  Can we take a moment to appreciate the beauty of the scene where Chris goes into the sunken place for the first time? The music and slow motion and everything was just too perfect - beautifully done. Rose eating fruit loops one at a time while drinking milk was the whitest thing I've seen in a long time. My group was dying when we saw that because we constantly roast one of our friends over how he eats his cereal.  Allison Williams on her final scene in the movie. 

Rose has this sadistic smile because she realizes that, in her last moments alive, she's succeeding in bringing Chris to the brink of becoming a beast—to use Jeremy's word—and she's just imagining what the repercussions will be. And then when he loosens his grip, she realizes that, in what is likely her last act, she has failed to do that. The disorientation she experiences from that is what we see on her face right afterward. And when the cop car comes up, she's more than happy to quickly switch into victim mode, which is excruciating because so much of the audience assumes that this is the end for Chris. Then when you find out that it's Rod, the look on her face is defeat. I think part of why Chris is content to let Rose perish slowly on the road by herself is to leave her with the knowledge that, not only did she fail at the job that she thinks she's so good at, but she also failed to break him in the way that she was so sure she'd be able to do.
http://www.instyle.com/news/allison-williams-get-out-movie-interview So, I have this white lady neighbor. She considers herself a ""white ally"" and loves telling everybody how racist they are and showing how ""woke"" she is, to the point where she makes not just white people, but also people of color really uncomfortable. She also happens to be married to a black man, whom she has referred to as her ""dark-skinned lover.""

Today she sent out an email saying that she has been credentialed as a hypnotherapist. Who can help with smoking cessation. And the first session is free.

!!!!!

TO THE SUNKEN PLACE!!! The golfer asking Chris to show him his golf stand. He was window shopping for a body damn. Can we talk about how great Rose's casting was? The switch from finding the keys to being stone cold was amazing to see
 Am I the only person that thought the use of cotton to get him out of the situation was incredibly clever symbolism?  This film had so many layers. Like in those few minutes between Chris discovering the photos and Rose telling Chris he can't have the keys, you think maybe Rose is not actually a villain, that maybe she was also somehow a victim and being manipulated by her parents. And then you realize that's the point: we're conditioned to always believe that white women are somehow the victim. 

Fucking brilliant. The best way to view this film is with as large a group of friends as possible. If you are not a Black American, seeing it with a diverse crowd will definitely enhance the experience- the response from fellow viewers adds to the laughs and there is ample opportunity for shared laughs and catharsis.

I saw this with a very fun audience in Brooklyn. The director, Jordan Peele, was present for a Q&A afterwards. One thing he mentioned was that he feels everyone, of all races, has racist tendencies. The main character has to deal with his own assumptions about Black women, for example, as he assumes Georgina(?) the maid was being hostile toward him because she might resent him for being with a white woman. As he said to his girlfriend, ""it's a thing."" And this assumption blocks him from assessing the situation clearly.

JP also mentioned he has several other films planned which will address different social contructs. Really looking forward to them.

My biggest laugh was definitely the Japanese millionaire (an ode to Rosemary's Baby) asking the question about whether being Black was more advantageous or less advantageous. I can't completely coherently describe why that line got me so hard, but as a Black woman who has gone through graduate art school, sometimes the intellectualizing of race gets ridiculous. I have had the experience of sitting within a group of non-Black people and had this question directed at me, and although the person asking is trying to sound academic and intelligent, ultimately the question is too simple and the answers are too complex. And sometimes I have to wonder how anyone with eyes can even ask such a question. In the end, most of us know the social hierarchy of the racial lottery. As a Black woman with a lighter brown skin, finer features and long hair I know I have been given some preferences in life, and it would be disengenuous to suggest otherwise. It kills me when people pretend we don't colorize. We do it amongst humans obviously, then within race. Blondes versus brunettes, etc. And yes, many people have racial envy that goes against the grain. I digress. Very fun film, and I agree it could have been more scary. The showdown scene was too short but there was still a lot to enjoy.
 [deleted] If you like Daniel Kaluuya, go watch his Black Mirror episode ''Fifteen Million Merits'' his speech in the end is really good. It's just so refreshing to see a horror movie where the characters make smart decisions and actually survive. Like Rod seeing through Rose's ruse (lol) on the phone, and Chris's whole escape plan. Something I realized hours after I watched the film:

* During the dinner scene [Rose's brother treases Rose about cutting off her nails as a child, sucking on them, and then collecting them in a little box.  Later in the movie, Chris finds a box in Rose's closet filled with pictures of the people she seduced and brought back to her family for sale.](#spoiler) At the core of white liberal guilt is the objectification of blacks and the appropriation of black culture; white liberals aren't your saviors, they're your  masked enslavers. 

After hitting the deer, the responding cop--often considered the epitome of institutional racism--seemingly commits the microagression of asking for the Chris's ID, and the white liberal girlfriend defends her boyfriend vocally. We don't know this at the time, but it's perhaps her way of concealing evidence of Chris's whereabouts. Asking for ID seemed an  unnecessary act motivated by racism, and it's the type of law enforcement strategy (e.g. stop and frisk) that many conservatives advocate (and are pilloried for) as a way to make urban neighborhoods safer, but it may have ultimately saved Chris's life. Just saw the movie for a second time. Main takeaway was that I went with my friend from Kenya, and he told me that the creepiest part for him was the music in the beginning with the chanting. I asked him what he was talking about and he said that it was Swahili and saying something along the lines of ""Run away to save your life."" Thought you guys would enjoy that.  Ok! That was an awesome watch. For this thread, sort by top/best.

I just realised that Georgina/Grandma didn't understand Chris when he said 'snitch' and ''rat you out' because she was pretty old fashioned and didn't understand modern lingo. Which is why she used 'tattletale',  a rather old fashioned word people of this generation rarely use.

Then when Chris expected to bump fists with 'Dre' but Dre shook his fist - that was because the man occupying Dre's body is unfamiliar with fist-bumping.

Aaaaghhhh!  Really smart movie. Spoke very well to race issues in modern society and avoided the stereotypical, one dimensional racism that is all too prevalent in movies that try to address race. These people don't hate African Americans, instead they envy them. This hits at the modern issues of race like the subtle racism of white guilt, cultural appropriation, and white privilege. 

On the actual story, I thought there was very little wasted motion in the film. Their concern over him smoking, the brother asking if he can fight in MMA, the woman feeling his bicep, the bingo game, all of it made so much sense once we got the big reveal. Everything seemed to have a specific purpose in what was essentially a modern recreation of a slave auction. 

And some good comedy moments as well. I lost it when Rose googled NCAA prospects to find her next victim.  He was gong to use his eyes to find his stapler! I'd imagine this will become the ""Jaws"" of dating white girls  [removed] The part where not-Andre talks about the black experience in America needs to be the sidebar image for /r/asablackman. It's crazy seeing how many people are saying, ""don't over think things,"" when that's a huge part of the movie. If you're black you overthink everything. I have to analyze everything I do from the way I wear my hair, what clothes I wear, who I date, where and when I drive, who I fuck, to how I express emotion much more than others, particularly in majority white spaces. Chris saying he gets nervous around too many white people is real life for a lot of us. Can you imagine having to be on edge like that every freaking day? At the doctor, in the office, at the store, and like in this movie, even in your relationships? He tried explaining the ""subtleties"" to his girlfriend and she couldn't see it. Later we learn why, but it's really introducing people to a language they don't understand. A lot of people don't see it because they don't live it and they've never been forced to. The invasion of personal space, the need to relate in a condescending way, the reassurance that they're cool because they experience black by proxy, the sexualization, this is shit that happens every freaking day and it's fucking exhausting. Sometimes you want to be around people who understand what that's  like. If that makes some white people uncomfortable to hear, imagine living it everyday. 

update: GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD! Thank you so much. I know reddit is generally a corny, cynical place but I'm grateful my tiny bit of vulnerability was acknowledged in a sweet way. Thanks y'all!  I don't think this has been mentioned yet, but the fact that the cell phone camera flash is what saves Chris could certainly be significant, and a reference to cell phone footage of police brutality being a defense for the black community.  I would've been dying if Rose was drinking chocolate milk toward the end. This should be shown in film schools for using subtle methods to support the story.

Let's talk about the subtle stuff with Rose. Up until the big 'reveal' she always had her hair down or very styled. Wore lots of makeup. After she was 'unmasked' she wore her hair in a severe and tight ponytail exposing her entire face, with no makeup. She was showing her 'real' face. 

The snack she was eating while surfing online for her next 'boyfriend'... frootloops.  Oh yeah and how one his girlfriend was her true self she was all in white drinking milk.  HOLY SHIT.... I like how the white people were *literally* race baiting too. Definitely intentional.  Also, I think it was on point that his captors were white, because slavery.

In all seriousness though, I thought the real world themes were woven into the script amazingly well.   I like to think I'm 100% not racist, but some of the more subtle ways this movie showed racism resonated.  For example, I'm likely ""too nice"" sometimes to people to overcompensate for our differences...while not being racist is really about treating everyone else exactly how you treat everyone else...I think. Or that at the end I was fucking terrified of the cop car showing up.

I don't got any ill will against cops, but you totally see ""Oh shit, this is gonna be spun against him hard."" That's a bold move, cotton.  MIND BLOWN.
I was wondering if it was intentional that the racist cop in the beginning of the movie who wanted Chis's ID for no real reason would have been his other hope for escape because there would have been a paper trail and they would have been keeping an eye on the suspicious black guy, if Rose hadn't ""defended"" Chris. It's brilliant because all those interactions could be explained as just them being nosy, ignorant while people. But they turned out to be way more sinister.  Ok I'm late to this thread, but I noticed too they were obsessed with him kicking his smoking habit because he was poisoning his body. Also, the blind man called the rest of them crazy -- yet assumed that that Chris's skills were thanks to his eyes alone, his genetics. Chris was a talented artist not because of his genes, but because of his mind. The blind man was perhaps even crazier / disillusioned than the others. Even if he's succeeded in the transfer, I bet he'd be a shit photographer. He was trying to play of Chris's name I think, but he would have tanked the reputation.

Although may be he was just trying to soften Chris up, but I like my theory more haha. I'm super late, but I have searched pretty hard to see if someone already said this-- even the Asian guy was trying to gauge if being black was an advantage or a disadvantage. That was the most clever one to me.  I went to see the movie again last night, and kind of like this scene, the part where the dad takes Chris on the tour of the house essentially lays out the entire rest of the plot very subtlety. This will seem like a stretch but bear with me-
 
""My wife's a therapist. Turns out people out here are just as crazy as those in the city"" (likening the suburbia elite to the urbanites) 

""That's rose's little brother, he's uhh studying medicine. Wants to be just like his old man."" (The bro helps the dad with the procedure) 

""I got these from Bali. I just love experiencing other people cultures"" obvious

""The basement is sealed up, we have some black mold down there"" aka ""that's where we make black people into molds for our friends prefrontal cortex or whatever"" *pans to Georgina* 

Then of course the Jesse Owens thing 
 I absolutely agree! I usually hate it when I hear people make loud comments during movie showings, but  watching this and cheering with everyone once each family member died was seriously the best When he was talking about rose lying ""you lying white bitch!"" holy shit the audience erupted into laughter. It's almost fourth wall breaking how he's saying exactly what we're all thinking, but at the same time he's just being a light hearted character who's god damn competent, and is trying his best to fix this shit and save his friend. Same! People yelling/clapping didn't bother me at all and my theater was PACKED. Fantastic viewing experience.  This was the first time I've had fun with audience members being kind of loud. It wasn't terribly intrusive, more just reactions to big moments, but I've always been (and still largely am) vehemently opposed to talking to the movie. I sort of get it now. I'm a black guy named Chris dating a white girl and I use a Windows phone. This shit hit way too many points for me.  And that they used Bing as their search engine.  If taken at face value it could be a dire warning to the main character to literally 'stay woke' against the hypnotizing.  

I'm probably over thinking this though. I loved the stark contrast between the shots of the forest with the weird folky hymn that makes you feel uncomfortable and alien, and then it instantly cuts to something a lot more relatable and understandable: a modern apartment set to Redbone And Georgina was always adjusting her hair. Yes.  God damn it's just revelation after revelation scrolling through this thread Yep, their scars were visible in the last fight scene once the hair/hat was out of the way.  But he's not? 

He's that woman's husband in a fresh new body. The Sex slave thing was a red herring.  Is he a sex slave or is he that old ladies husband?   Don't forget all of the other guys on Rose's wall.  I assumed they didn't simply just go home, go to bed, and move on with life. Heck, he likely went to the hospital  who would have 100% asked him how it all happened. Police would have gotten involved, dots connected with other missing people, ect  Oh my god This movie was so damn well written. Every time i think I've caught every thing, there's some other small thing like that which blows my mind Well he usually wakes up after so he does fall asleep somewhere in between I was thinking about that too. They had such a warm embrace because they were long time friends. Also, when the older lady tells the young black guy (Andre, I think) that everyone is waiting to see him, at first I thought it was her trying to show him off. But the way he goes over and does a little spin, like saying check out my new suit, he's literally saying check out my new body. He's showing it off like a new haircut. The little details in this movie are fantastic. They also said ""When my grandparents died, they became family."" So that's another hint.  Also when they said the groundskeeper/helper were ""like family"" they weren't kidding... fucking granny and grandpappy It also seems like it could be an episode of Black Mirror. This was definitely genre bender. I loved that it kept me guessing about wtf was going to happen next. I'm going to rewatch it for sure.  I'm really glad it was so comedic yet kept the scares. The last half was a thrill ride. It's also why the mother stopped Jeremy from wrestling with Chris at the dinner table; she didn't want the goods damaged. Definitely.  And now I wonder why the mom asked if he smoked around Rose was more of a dig at Rose. Like why did my daughter choose a smoker? Doesnt she know?  [deleted] Every comment on here is blowing my damn mind. This movie is so elegantly crafted. It reminds me of what someone (don't remember who) said about Hot Fuzz - that if you took Hot Fuzz and folded it in half, the two halves would line up. The first half is setup, setup, setup, and the second half is punchline, punchline, punchline. What Jordan Peele has achieved with Get Out is nothing short of breathtaking. I'll have to see it again but as I'm thinking about it a couple of hours post-show I don't remember a single wasted moment. Every single beat in the first act gets twisted into something new in the second act. [deleted] That Jeffrey Dahmer monologue had me in tears Rod stands for Ride or Die Rod was a really interesting character. My favorite by far.  He was literally the embodiment of every movie goer who critics horror movies while watching. I liked his character more than I thought I would. At first I thought he'd be the over the top comic relief. He had just the right amount of comic relief without being silly yes i was bout to cry cus i thought it was a cop and then i cheered and iv never cheered before Yes. The whole audience gasped when they saw the lights lol YES! So much yes! Everyone also applauded at the end of the film as well. Yup! I saw it in an affluent area of Tampa. Movie got 3 applause lines. One when Chris stomped LaxBro's head in, one when Rose got shot, and one when the police door swung open and it said ""airport.""



That last scene was so well done. When the flashing lights show up you get a pit in your stomach that he's going to get arrested or shot, due to his race and race of Rose. When you see the door says ""Airport,"" it's definitely a ""fuck yes!!"" moment. Can we also talk about how she smiled as he was close to choking her to death? Fucking crazy. Like she was enjoying the fact she had pushed him to kill her because it proved her ideology.  I thought the same thing while seeing it. He really loved his mother, as he did Rose (until.. you know). He felt extreme guilt for his mother's dead & this time around, same situation, he didn't. I thought it was incredible.  Maybe I'm overthinking... when his mother lay on the road his fear kept him from saving her, when Georgina lay on the road his guilt made him get her. He was able to make his own rational choice about Rose. His personal agency was fully realized after nearly losing it entirely. That's why he stopped choking her. He knew the most horrible death was her dying alone on the road hoping someone comes. He felt that was the death she deserved. Not the easier way out.  oh my gosh that would have been hilarious I saw a joke saying Ben Carson was a transplant. WOOH. This thread is so much fun.  No that was just a cover they were never hired both Walter and Georgia were seduced by Rose those are the last pictures Chris saw in the box when he figured it all out. I've said Holy Fuck so many times while reflecting on this movie. Thanks for yet another Holy Fuck moment.  He also says something about 'This was mom's favourite room in the house; there's a piece of her in this room' and Georgina is standing in the kitchen. DUDE


BLACK..... **MOLD**



OMG When he caught the knife *in* his fucking palm, holy shit. I appreciated his apprehension before he killed some one instead of just going right into killing people. He went full Wolverine with that deer head, the was so badass Yes! Reminded me of Django Unchained. I think it may have had something to do with the people at the party putting up a facade in front of Chris.

Not too sure why they went quite though. Maybe, they were fantasizing how they would be able to use him for their personal gain? That's probably a stretch, but I'm just throwing possibilities out there. That part was sooooo creepy.  Yea. I thought I could hear the keys shuffling around in the bag a few seconds before he yelled at her. I guess he wanted to believe that it wasn't her. That she had been hypnotized into doing it. Thought that whole scene was well executed.  One of the most dreadful, foreboding, tense scenes I've seen in a while. Plays into the fear that he is fighting alone in this situation when he thought she was hypnotized from what her family was doing as well. A lot of minorities feel that way at times when their friends (particularly white) don't see or understand the heightened social issues their minority friends face in hand. That was an excellent scene.  Well they are from Oakland and I bet her dad would have voted Obama for a 3rd time if he could  In case anyone is confused, Chelsea Peretti is Jordon Peele's wife Or Jordan Peele's parents Since the movie cost $4million and is now over $111million, I'd say everyone in the family is laughing all the way to the bank.  I actually thought that Rose was being hypnotized as a pawn in the plan after I figured out Chris wasn't the first.  The picture box confirmed the cyclic operation, but I didn't drop her being hypnotized until her actual reveal.  I was actually drawn into my theory by the way she kept struggling to find the keys with the same response, like she'd been hypnotized not to find them. >I turned to my husband after Georgettia said ""tattletale"" and said they are **Skeleton Key-ing** their asses.

Ha, good call, totally forgot about that movie, but you're right. Pretty sure that was a rifle but nice connection.  So many little things...like how Georgina kept adjusting her hair throughout the movie to keep her scar from the procedure concealed.  My thoughts exactly! I like how, in the trailer, the cop is seen as part of the problem. But, in reality, had he been successful in seeing his name and ID, it would have been a good thing. To take it even further, the cop might have even been starting to suspect something based on the fact that the chick had been brining up multiple guys up to her parent's place. Just wait for Armond White to fuck it up. Armond WHITE...oh my god, will the layers of symbolism never end??? ah of course, I was wondering how that would tie in.

I just figured out the bingo game was really just an auction for all the white people to bid on Chris. The blind guy won, but others were scouting him during the party. Some wanted him for his strength, some for his long schlong.

The party isn't a family reunion. None of them are related except for the grandparents who live on the property. Everyone else is just a rich white person practicing in a new-era slave trade.

This movie is DEEP ""He almost got over it"" He was SUCH a good friend. Hell, he even had the keys to his house, took care of his dog, and didn't go after his girlfriend. I loved how in the ending, he was like ""I told you not to go.""  

That is a true friend. He loves you but loves also being right. This movie made really good use of the extreme close-up. I never felt as claustrophobic as I did when Chris and Georgina were talking about his phone. I felt the whole message of the movie was that the relationship between white and black people was not white people hated black people, but that white people were jealous of black people. The grandfather never got over it because he was so impressed by their genetic dominance. The people in the party were always feeling him up, one even asked if the sex was better. They wanted to become black because black people were better. I thought the literal commodification of black bodies was an interesting angle. Then the part with the art dealer added another layer, one that's even more perverse in a way - he wanted eyes that worked, sure, just like the grandparents wanted bodies that weren't dying, but the idea that he'd somehow absorb Chris' expertise and artistic ability - when he himself was already successful despite being blind - seemed even more greedy. He was willing to kill Chris on the chance that some small sliver of his artistic talent would be kept alive. So it's debatable whether he was really less racist than the people who believed black bodies were superior, and black minds were expendable.  I felt like no one laughed but me at that part Wonder if that was a tie to how black people are ""suspicious of magic.""  

Key & Peele had an opening for a sketch (and ending to a show) dispalying this.  Jordan did a magic trick and Keegan responded ""aw hell naw, you a demon!"" Me too! Arguably my favorite line of the film. Andre is still living that nightmare. Poor guy. Was really hoping for a brief flash after the credits showing him freed or something

but he's still out there [deleted] I was wondering if Peele would go with a dark ending of the cop showing up and killing Chris in a scenario similar to what we see on the news. He could have been completely oblivious of The Family. Would have really brought it to a dark place, but also realistic place. I'm glad he went with the happier ending. I don't know if I could have taken that dark/realistic of an ending. To be fair, I think strangling a girl on the road as the cops pulled up had something to do with that feeling too. Lmao the second I saw the ""AIRPORT"" text on the car, I sighed in relief. Dry fruit loops with a glass of milk? Sick bitch...  i was hoping he'd come in with a baseball bat during this scene My movie buddy and I said the same thing! So disturbing. The biting the loop in half, the excessive milk sipping. Fucking scary.
 Damn, you're right  I thought Rose was a cunt for being so difficult with the cop. Even if the law didn't require him to give his ID (I'm not sure if this is the case), it was still a reasonable request from the cop to take identification from everyone in the car.

[I was kinda keeping on eye on her after that, and it unfortunately wasn't a huge surprise that she turned out to be bad. I was never 100% sure, though, because they chose to not give any hints whatsoever up until the very end.](#spoiler) You're so right. The better scary thing is seeing the character be manipulated by everyone around him, rather than him just doing something completely irrational like so many horrors or thrillers would do. It's so much more relatable to see it this way. I love going through this thread and seeing all the things that I didn't catch. Good point on his intelligence. The fight scene was great. I kept saying why the fuck would you go for the door when he's choking you... try something else, and all of a sudden he proves me wrong.  [It was a great call back to when the brother had said judo was more about thinking ahead, as if Chris wasn't able to do that.](#spoiler) The day after I saw Get Out, I went to breakfast with my sister. I wasn't paying attention when she started stirring her coffee and was clinking the glass. I looked up so fast in a panic, I could have broken my neck.  Yep, seeing it a second time, I noticed Chris realizing that Jeremy keeps kicking the door.

It's really a beautifully foreshadowed movie, everything makes sense in context. >Only thing I can trust is the TSA

The real takeaway here haha >When he had the short talk with the blind guy, I really was irked that it was filler.

When that guy first showed up, I thought he was like a detective who was trying to take the family down. That actress did an awesome job of mixing emotions, which we now know was her true self trying to break out of the grandma's control. I totally agree. The only other movie I've had that ""what the fuck is happening"" feeling was during The Shining. I love how Jordan Peele accomplished this in his first film. Yeah, no way she mastered a press and curl. Straight up wig.  Yeah and she was looking in the mirror and in the window. She was admiring her black skin and face so much. Much like they do black beauty they look down on it but then they secretly love it and imitate it (tans, lip injections, butt implants).. She probably was loving her new hair. In real life they're so fascinated by it and always want to touch it. Well now she could do it to herself all she wanted. That is brilliant. I also thought it was because she was self-conscious about the scars from the surgery. She had to ensure her wig would cover it (for the same reason ""Grandpa"" wore a ballcap and Logan/Andre had that dopey straw hat).
 Movie would have been over haha  Movie would have ended soon after that for better or worse  He definitely functions as a Greek chorus. Without him, an audience member would forget that they have too much knowledge (knowing it's a horror film) and we'd be prone to ""I'd have been out of there when x!"" Rod reminds us that it's not only difficult to assess real time situations but also that people who ""excessively"" question or are ""overly"" suspicious are regarded as paranoid, and most people (Chris, in this case) assume there is a perfectly reasonable explanation.  He keeps us inside the movie and less likely to write off Chris's reactions and excuses for the creepiness as unrealistic. 

Really, really brilliant writing by Jordan Peele.  i was gonna cry when i thought it was the police  i was so happy to see rod Which also explains Rose's reason for snapping at the cop for asking for ID. When Chris inevitably goes missing, she doesn't want the police to recall his whereabouts. Either that or he really was racially profiling him which would have turned out to be a blessing in disguise when filing a missing person report.  Wait, shit isn't that basically the end of Othello? Audience in my theater cheered when it turned out to not be some random cop. I loved the comic relief he brought. This movie solidified my faith in Jordan Peele. OMG that explains the weird fast running. ""He almost got over it"" 

But then he didn't. And spent his life in pursuit of a fix  [deleted] And the Brother wanted his body. With some real training he could be one of the greatest MMA fighters.  shit I didn't even think about that part. damn I need to see this movie again lol The scene where she's gathered a small audience and for a second we think ""wait, they're buying this?"" is so great.  I think he, like many of us, assumed she was a victim as well...

I mean she got me :-/ This is the sort of shit I _love_! Subtle hints to other films, just goes to show how much Peele loves the classics.  After the movie we had a group of black dudes yelling ""no more white bitches"" as we were leaving the theater. It was hilarious. I think the auction - presented to the black guest as a ""party"" - is a typical part of the Armitages ruse. If she told Chris ahead of time that there was a party (or seemed to be aware of one), it would look suspicious. She always acts like the ""party"" is a surprise. Just don't go meet the parents. You good.  lol you're making it sound like a racial version of Gone Girl That was what I kept thinking. Out of the thousands of people that will/have seen this movie, you know there have to be a handful of black man/white woman couples on a first date. That's gotta be a weird atmosphere lol A great example of satire. I feel like a lot of black men can relate to being treated like a piece of meat, but of course they literally only cared about his body. He sat and did nothing when his mom was hit by a car. 
Thus, when he hits the deer and leaves it to die, he's reminded of his mother.  Except in this it's ""Not the tea!"" I agree that it was my favorite moment but not just because its bizarre, but its the first moment where you are given the information that this entire event is for Chris. Everyone there is there for Chris. You don't know why quite yet but after that you know that its not just a weird white person event, its a house full of predators circling their prey. Once he leaves their sight, all they care about is him returning to continue to study him before the bingo auction. As soon as they all stopped talking my stomach dropped like a brick Yeah, I think they were trying to ""blend in"" and hadn't been raised as an actual black person to know what it would be like or how to interact.  They were acting as they would if a young black man talked to them while they were still old and white.


Additionally, I think maybe the ""host"" mind sometimes was trying to fight through so they had to be really deliberate and fight back. The way I understood it, as explained by Stephen Root (the blind art dealer), was that they did some kind of a brain transplant with a section of the brain that allowed them to move the consciousness of the original person (the old white people) into the body of the young black people, but the original ""host"" consciousness was still there below the surface. 

So when you saw Andre talking and the housekeeper and groundskeeper, that was really the old white people talking and the original ""host"" consciousness was able to see everything going on, but could not ""act."" Apparently the camera flash allowed them to come back to the surface.

 > You are encouraged to make excuses for Rose throughout the whole movie until you literally have no other option but to accept that she was in on it.

This. I mentioned above that I was holding out hope until she showed the keys that she had just been repeatedly hypnotized. I didn't even realize until you pointed it out here, but that is some latent apologism.  The interaction with the police officer in the beginning was the perfect set up for the final scene so that your stomach totally drops when the flashing blue lights show up--in so many films this would be a lifesaver, but here it most likely only means more danger. 

The film had so much great foreshadowing. I thought it was great all around but I was particularly impressed with how tight the storytelling was. Everything was so tight that I can't think of a single wasted scene: his mom's accident meant he didn't have surviving family to seek him out, his hand scratching, his photography, the Jesse Owens line.... everything just seemed to pay off and serve a purpose. Both Key and Peele never cease to impress me and Jordan Peele really knocked it out of the park with this one. I'm pretty sure I remember Peele mentioning this in an interview, actually.

I myself am extremely liberal, but holy shit. I can't tell you how many people I know (specifically middle-aged liberals) who love to spout off all these weird micro-aggressions. They don't seem overtly racist on the surface, but they build up. The ""I would have voted Obama for a third time"" is something we've all probably heard a lot.

I think those micro-aggressions played really well with the family trying to ""seem"" not racist. There is still a large portion (though I'd argue less than the far right) of liberals who have this undercurrent of racism attached. This film spoke to that extremely well. I know I'm way late to the party but this completely breezed past me. His compassion and his guilt over his mom literally did save him. Bruh. This is the most mind blowing part. Grandpa was a racer. He lost to a black guy. He ALMOST got over it. Black people are superior. Why the fuck is that black groundskeeper running like there's no tomorrow in the middle of the night?  I think it's a sign of a truly great horror film when it can make you look inward and be uncomfortable with what you see. Really incredible filmmaking and storytelling. It's because he knew that he's stuck only for a minute he would be out of it. I would have done the same or it's back to purgatory  Everyone went wild when his bro Rodney showed up in the end. My man!!! Rod definitely felt like Jordan mad about too many dumb characters in horror movies. My audience cheered when he muted the phone and said ""this bitch is lying"". Your question gets to the heart of the brilliance of the social commentary of the movie.  Why did everyone act so weird and why were they not able to act normal and non-racist?  It's the exact reason many white people are not able to act normal when they try to have casual conversations with black people and try to prove that they are not racist.  They say things like were said in the movie like ""I would have voted for Obama a 3rd time"".  I've had my own share of weird experiences and conversations like that with white people so I found that brilliant. The grandparents were weird because they HAD to pretend like they were black ""help"" while also staying in control over the consciousness of the other people in their brain. That's why they acted so strangely. Imagine a rich 90 year old pretending to be a black 35 year maid, while acting like nothing is wrong when everything is wrong. They were REALLY bad at it, the daughter was perfect at it but it's because she was likely raised and trained from birth to be the 'bait'.  [deleted] Chris killing everyone was the most satisfaction I have felt from a movie in a long time.  Unrelated but fun fact: apparently they didn't have to speed that scene up in post, the actor is legitimately just *actually that fast*. Isn't that so impressive!? Did she smile because he was backing off, and she realized that he could't go through with killing her? That's the impression I got.  Drinking a pristinely white glass of milk through a black straw. You copied and pasted this from screenrant you turd burgler spot on comment and I hope to see more commentary like this in the future. if Hollywood wants to stay relevant in the fight against racism, they'll have to keep making these types of films. I love how Microsoft clearly paid them to use surfaces and use bing instead of google but you still say that she googled NCAA prospects. Just thought that was funny Eating dry cereal and drinking milk. Probably the most horrifying image in the film. Legit my reaction, just brilliant. Black or white, that bait would work on any man. I have to say, I appreciate the seeming uncertainty in your answer. It's a complicated problem and the solution is not obvious. Any sort of certainty in the answer to this problem indicates that you don't fully understand the problem, I think. 

So thank you for trying. Thank you for realizing it's complicated. Thank you for even taking the time to question your own behavior. It sets a good example.  They also felt sadly authentic to me.   Oh shit! I am realizing so much from this thread that I didn't pick up at first I just saw the film. I thought they were concerned about the smoking to.convince him to try and be hypnotized to ""quit"". I think him being a smoker was a real reason he was chosen.

Smoker - reason to try hypnosis.
No immediate family - easier to.stage disappearance. 

They did their homework. I think you may have misinterpreted this. The blind man specifically says something alone the lines of that he doesn't care what race Chris is. He just wants eyes. 

That's what makes the blind man's character and his motive way deeper than just wanting a black body.  So much fun. The loudest cheer came when Rod steps out of the cop car at the end. The rollercoaster of emotions leading up to that was incredible, especially because it ended in a good way. Everyone just wanted to celebrate.  Agreed, a friend told me there was a twist ending, so I was worried for a second but luckily it turned out alright at the end. That's what I enjoyed most about the movie. The protagonist wasn't dumb at all! Everytime something weird would happen (e.g. Cell phone being unplugged) he would call it out immediately and say exactly what the audience is thinking. Same goes for his friend. Awesome movie  GET OUT It was the best Microsoft commercial I've ever seen. I don't think you are! It's a really good song to make sure your brain is tuned to the thriller setup. You're not over thinking it. That was definitely intentional and they deserve props for everything they did through music and sounds in this movie.  That was Grandma  Doesn't her wig come off at the end? Although I'm not sure she was doing that to hide the scars so much as she was just excited to be in a young, beautiful body again. She was constantly looking into reflections to look at new younger body. Andre is still conscious underneath, though, and it's his body. So the person ""at the wheel"" isn't a slave, but the body and the fragment of the original mind are. Both - the old man's brain is in Andre's body.

Not sure if they would be able to like, preserve Andre to help him :( OK fuck this whole thread, I'm going to see it again. I saw it last night, and it's got to have one of the least amounts of filler in a movie I can think of. It was a good movie, but one of the most commendable parts for me was how everything was entirely relevant.  It also explains why he's wearing that goofy straw hat the whole time. Because they would have seen his head scars.  That's what I was thinking, too. It's funny because the main actor stars in S1E2 of Black Mirror.

Edit: I can't get over the irony that his name in that episode was Bing.... and they feature Bing, the search engine, in the movie. Probably not a big deal but I thought it was funny. she even says ""you've damaged him enough already"" It's interesting, I think the parents genuinely were displeased with Jeremy acting the way he did at that first dinner with Chris... not because Jeremy was being a dick, but because he (being drunk) was the one getting closest to giving away the whole thing. My thought is that Rose recruited a smoker on purpose. It's used as a rouse to get him to sit down for hypnosis. 
He goes out for a smoke in the middle of the night. The mom is awake, waiting for him. It's how she gets in.  I came to this thread COMPLETELY ignorant. I need to re-watch it now.  Most positive depiction of a TSA agent in a movie ever? I thought it was gonna be that shitty bald cop from the start when they hit the deer ""Well howdy-do officer! We've had a doozie of day here. We got a grounds keeper killing himself, a guy without his head, a man stabbed with a deer head, and white people stealing black people!""

(Tucker and Dale reference) I saw it in a non-affluent area of Tampa and the audience lost their minds. [removed] I thought she was smiling because she could hear the police car approaching, or see it approaching out of the corner of her eye. Black guy choking his white girlfriend in the middle of a country road? Take a guess whose story the police are going to believe. And she knew it. Oh dang, I thought she was smiling cuz she knew he wouldn't do it. That makes sense tho, I'll have to watch again. When the cops were pulling up, too, and her weak little ""help..."" whimper. Just...aaauugggh, that made me so god damn angry, haha 

Like, fuck, I really REALLY thought they were going to god damn kill him in the end, just to prove a point. I was so fucking happy when they didn't.   also he has a chance to drive away, but he can't leave georgina laying in the road... That could be why he checked on the deer too. He could hear it suffering and it reminded him of mom This could have been hilarious if there was just a picture of Rose and Obama in the middle of the stack I thought that also could've been some type of foreshadowing moment that their procedure had reached so far as to the White House and that peele may have subliminally been hinting towards the notion that Obama had been simply a puppet of the white elite.  He didn't even wince at first, he just stared at her Because the ""family reunion"" was a ruse. They didn't need to keep it up when Chris wasn't there. It addition to what others said, it was also another clever bit of misdirection, in my opinion.  It made me think that when he was out of their sight, he was not to be trusted so they were all straining to listen to what he was doing and where he was going upstairs. Agree, I thought I heard the keys shuffling a few times.
 > I guess he wanted to believe that it wasn't her. That she had been hypnotized into doing it.

So did I.  TIL. 

Sent me down a wiki rabbit hole (well, just clicked her page and read her early life section) and I found out that Chelsea's older brother founded Buzzfeed and co-founded the Huffington Post. 

You'd think you'd be the star sibling being one of the stars on a golden globe broadcast tv show....
 And she is not black.. I'm biracial and went to see it with my brother. My (white) mom kept asking us if we thought she'd like it and we were like ""ehhhhh..."" Yeah, same reaction for me. I thought she was being hypnotized or controlled somehow into being an unwitting pawn in the whole thing. She really sold the ""struggling to find the keys"" schtick, and then bam, bye bye to MGM theory. 



One thing I'm not clear on though is who left the door open in the bedroom and the box of pictures just sitting there. That was only thing that sort of bothered me.  Or how andre was showing off his new body to the guest to show them that the procedure does work fuuuuuck that's why she was doing it Agree except for that last part. The deer accident wasn't a scripted event that happened every iteration and her hostility toward the cop shows he wasn't in on it and not overly familiar with her or the family.  There's nothing suggesting he was aware of her past vicitms at all. I think they stopped counting his reviews Yeah I was on the way home and trying to figure out wtf that bingo scene was all about and then it just hit me. I also liked that all the cards already had ""bingo"" on it - they've all already won.  I don't know how anybody could miss it. It was obvious. jesus fucking christ > didn't go after his girlfriend

That's a really low bar for someone considered SUCH a good friend This comment literally made me realize that Georgina unplugged the phone and didn't replug it because elders don't know how technology works. Holy shit. Yeah, the community is basically a cult that fetishizes black people as genetically superior beings that they can never attain the same levels of so they've somehow got it in their heads that the only way to win is to put their heads into the black people's heads
 He was a succesful art dealer but not a succesful photographer That happened to me a couple times. When she Bing'd 'Top NCAA prospects' I laughed so hard but no one else did. I was the only one in my theater that laughed at that, but I thought it was hilarious. You know damn well if you were in his situation you'd consider magic even if it was only for 1/2 a second.  I would imagine that after the movie ends there's a police investigation. I mean, Andre was reported missing and everything. If they found him, I don't really know what they would do next, though — his brain's gone. It makes the fake at the beginning even better though when the police officer is asking for Chris' state ID at the beginning of the movie. At first you thought it was cause the town was racist, but then you realize it was because he would of been identified if he gave his license, which is why his girlfriend threw a bitch fit.  He said in an interview that was his original ending  I like that he subverted your expectations with the cop car at the end.

In the beginning, if you're not already aware, you are made acutely aware that there's always a danger when a black man has to interact with a white cop. Then at the end, you're even more on edge because the cop car at face value looks like it actually *won't* be the savior. Peele allows you to empathize with the fear and terror of being a black person having to interact with the police. Ya except I mean I'd hope the cops would investigate the house and find mind control shit before shooting him

That's kinda the point too She was a white girl wearing a white shirt drinking milk (which is white) through a straw, no less. Hilarious. The brother actually said jujitsu was a mental martial art, and basically called judo reactionary *Eyes wide with a single tear* Sometimes, they might know *more* than detectives because they handle terrorism and shit. I didn't picture detective but I really thought he would have some role in helping save the day in the end. They set us up good.  But that would mean that the guy who saved the day in the end was a white guy. This movie is NOT about a white savior. THANK GOD!!!

PS- Nothing in Art (books, poems, legends, myths, song lyrics, music, paintings, sculptures, etc is ever filler. 

It's all there for a reason. 

This is why I think editors are badasss.  Reminded me of the Key and Peele skit ""Laron Can't Laugh."" Georgina looked like she was trying to laugh but just couldn't let it out. This made me almost LOL at work! Her wig also came of in the car when she was fighting Chris. You have mistaken me for someone cultured. Yeah I thought that was a really smart twist. Right when he calls 911, I just knew the ending was going to be him getting arrested for killing all these white people. Great set up. 
 Yeah I totally thought Peele was going for the horror being he'd be blamed for killing all the nice white people. That dudes comedic timing is perfect. Explaining the whole Jeffrey Dahmer thing was just so real; didn't even feel like he was acting Oh geeze!!! This movie worked on a hundred levels!!! 

Jordan Peele you're a rock star!! I want to put *your mind* into *my body*!!! Shit I never would have made that connection! That shit scared the hell out of me. now that you mention this...is that why the mother hated chris smoking??? Because he was damaging his body?! When the blind guy was explaining the procedure I realized that Walter was the grandfather and georgetta the grandmother the sprinting all kind of tied it together for me.  OP's too far gone. His girlfriend has probably already made him her sex slave. I did exactly that. We're 4 months in too. It's almost scary how similar the situation was. I just met her parents 2 weeks ago, glad they didn't kill me.  Moreso than that, he's compelled to at least look at the victim. They hit the deer, he HAD to see it. When he hit the grandma-maid he HAD to help her even if it was against his best interest. Yeah when the maid/grandmother and Chris were talking I think the subconscious was trying to take over.  Yeah but why didn't they play it cool? I mean the maid and grounds keeper were both weird as hell. They could've just said ""yeah man this place is cool, the people are nice, cool to see another black dude around.""  I think its interesting their racism manifests itself as a desire to be like the black guy. Like the people are all eyeing his body for being ""cooler"" or ""more muscular"" or some other thing they percieve that makes the main character better because of his skin color. Its really not traditional racism in that sense which I think was a really interesting choice.  I loved that part. It made absolutely no sense when it happened, and I thought him sprinting was just something to make the movie a little more creepy. It only clicked at the very end.  It was so weird; I was so ready for them to *hate* black people, but it ended up being this reverse racism where they instead ENVIED them in their fucked up, controlling, obsessive way. Holy shit dude that blew my mind I don't know if it is. Andre had to be re-hypnotized to return to his grandpa state, so it's possible that he could have survived. I think he was more traumatized by the fact that he'd been living in the sunken place for decades, and had to watch as his body was used as a tool to do something horrible to people. And it was definitely heading towards the horror trope of the expert/friend figuring it out and dying on his way to help. Subverted it first by actually *GOING TO THE AUTHORITIES* (dude's a goddamn horror movie genius) and subverted it again by showing up at exactly the not-wrong time.  I got real giddy when he stomped the brother's fucking face.   That deer head kill though. I thought she was smiling in a ""You are everything bad we ever said about you"" kind of way. Especially with how contorted with anger Chris's face was during the moment, he was the physical embodiment of the Black Devil as seen throughout propaganda against blacks. For him to reject that and not kill was a powerful moment. But I might have seen it wrong. I found the most horrifying thing was that she was using Bing while doing that. Uh no,  it was her complete lack of emotion and facial expressions when she was on the phone with Rod, she looked exactly like the T-1000 from T 2 when he's on the phone with John.  She kept the multicolored cereal away from the white milk. Deep.  The little sips she kept taking. If I hadn't have seen the movie up until that point, I'd have said, ""yup, serial killer"". As a black guy who has been in interracial relationships, some of the conversations were eerily similar to some I've had before. yeah they definitely do their research, implied by Rose looking up NCAA prospects at the end. it made me wonder about the reasons she picked her previous black boyfriends, did they all have some kind of trauma happen to them? did they all smoke? that would have been clever if while he was looking through her pictures, some of them were smoking in the pictures. idk, that might have been too on the nose though Stay woke.  The only exception to that is when he goes into the cupboard and finds the photos of all the other guys. The audience was yelling ""don't go in there!"" And her mom looks just like the one in the movie. So there's that.  I was wondering since they were the grandma and grandpa, why did they make them servants? You would think the grandparents would be living the life in their new bodies but even the mother was a little rude to her mother/mother in law. Yeah it does, and you can see her scar Something nobody seems to be bringing up is that this is an extended metaphor for the minority experience in general. In order to function in a society as a minority, you have to act exactly how white people expect you to act. The real you is still in there somewhere, but it must always be subservient to your ""white"" self.  The movie then echos the thought that the only way to break out of this pattern is through violence. It's brilliant because all of the weird scenes from before suddenly make absolute sense the second time through, or thinking back on it after the big reveal.  

It's...god damn, it's an entirely different movie the second time through. It's fucking fascinating. And he gave up everything he had worked for for a white girl...and it bit him in the ass Oh shit! I was wondering where I recognized him from! That was when they caught him. She didn't want them fighting at the beginning of the movie for that very reason Question: what the fuck was with the grandpa running at Chris?  Like, did he lose control of the body for a bit, or was he just being fucking weird?  I still don't get that scene, creepy as it was. ""The TSA being portrayed in a positive light"" *Ding* Sup fellow Tampon.



Yeah, Peele did an incredible job getting the audience to truly root for Chris. He wasn't the usual idiot horror movie person. He continually grew suspicious of everything, made smart choices, while not wanting to overreact, still please his girlfriend's family. A lot of horror films make the mistake of having the protagonists be idiots, to the point the audience is almost rooting for the bad guy(s). In this you want Chris to win and go out with a fucking vengeance because he's been smart the whole time.  > /s

cept not  You motherfuckers are way too smart That would have been genius Then Rosie and Michelle.  They're saving that for Get Out 2 His adrenaline had to have been going through the roof at that point. You can do incredible things when high on adrenaline.  It's really just ~~strangers~~ peeps at an auction.

EDIT: because ppl are telling me they aren't strangers. Luke Walton, head coach of the Lakers and the son of NBA great Bill Walton, has a brother who is a billionaire due to trading oil. I think it was Georgina, she's the only one who showed signs of resistance without the camera flash. You just reminded me, I was wondering how she could be so unfazed hearing the screams of an animal she'd severely wounded. I can see why now.  just check, his review is rough lol
 I knew it was an auction, but I didn't catch on to the fact that all of the white couples were asking him questions about skills they wanted themselves until after the movie. When the blind guy won, I thought they were just going to do an eye transplant.

Didn't see the whole body thing coming. How did it not click with you when the picture of Chris was sitting up there next to the guy while he was counting upwards with his fingers?
 I thought it was because they want his phone dead so he wouldn't make phone calls  Except for the Japanese guy who was quite concerned about living as a black guy in this day and age, he had his trepidations  People in my theatre thought the NCAA part was hilarious. No reaction either on the magic part though. I thought it was hilarious. Oh shiiiiiiit good catch  Wow.  Thank you for this.  That went way over my head. Wasn't the house about to burn down? through a BLACK straw. She was doing her white thing by USING a black straw

symbolism was all over that movie It was great foreshadowing with the dinner scene:

Looking back you can see that the Brother enjoyed his ""method"" of hunting and prided himself on his (basic) understanding and use of Jiu Jitsu so subdue people. He's borderline shaking and practically chomping at the bit to try and put a rear naked choke on Chris during their talk about Martial Arts. It explains why he's so hostile when his sister tells him off for it and why he seems to relish the moment when he gets to fight Chris their final confrontation. It shows that he loves and craves the feeling of overpowering someone he considers, as he puts it, to have a ""better genetic make up"".

Amazing to see such depth in a supporting character. Especially when using hindsight. as soon as he said that I knew there would be a rear naked choke at some point in the movie I might be remembering wrong, but did the girl have natural hair in the picture she took with Rose? Because you KNOW ol' girl ain't doing an eight hour wash and detangle day. Hand her a jar of coconut oil and a comb and she'd be all kinds of lost! Don't worry about it, the people Shakespeare wrote his plays for were a bunch of toothless peasants who had a life expectancy of 37, you are (in all likelihood) FAR more cultured than they ever were.

Anyway, Othello is about this Black Nobleman who is tricked into smothering his White Wife with a pillow by a Jealous Schemer. The moment he killed Caleb Jones I thought "" he's going to jail, fuck this movie"" such a great twist.  ""All they wanted to do was suck some dick, but they couldn't even do that cause they head was chopped off"" That guy was really good.

My favorite bit with him has to be everything with the phone call with Rose. Him calling her a genius at the end of it killed me. Well now that you mention THAT, yes I bet that's what it was. Nice catch. I thought it could be that, but it also could be that Rose picks guys that have a trait they might want to get rid of via hypnosis, so that they are more suggestible. Like he didn't fight too hard when she started hypnotizing him because on some level he wanted to quit. How do we know it's really you? I think it was a combination of that and her being offended about his remarks on white people. Because they were old white people who didn't know how to masquerade as black people in front of an actual black person. The people in the movie were racist through their ignorance. And it's so much better this way because these type of people actually exist in pretty large number, making it that much more relatable.  And when Chris told Georgina, the maid, that he didn't mean to ""snitch"" or ""rat her out,"" she didn't understand was because she was really white, old Grandma Armitage. I don't think they *had* to re-hypnotize him. I think it would have sorted itself out given a minute or so. They did remove most of that guy's brain. The dude who played the brother did a great job. I fucking despised him and his gross mustache. All of the characters were great.  That is ms product placement, same with the surface and Windows phone As a half-black-half-white guy with divorced parents, I've had these conversations with people I'm supposed to call ""family"" As a white guy, I definitely felt like the first half of this film was just beautifully set up examples of microaggressions. I'm glad to hear that my impressions appear to have been accurate.

How Peele was able to tie these things into actually being relevant to the twist astonishes me. Yup, I agree there was that moment and when he got out of the car to get Georgina. My audience was yelling at the screen and we all collectively groaned when he did.  

But if he chose not to he wouldn't have known that Rose was in on it the whole time, and she wouldn't have died at the end because he would have escaped. 

  If you ever see her drinking tea, cover your ears. I hope you have a friend that works for the TSA. I would assume they did that to keep them close, besides you know old or elder people like to cook and do yard work and stuff like that. But I would assume that lived a normal crazy life when visitors aren't there.  Well, grandma cooked and cleaned for her family, normal grandma stuff, while grandpa was outside doing manual labor to enjoy his strong, young body. Plus it was a perfect way to make them seem like servants I think that was just a show for Chris to provide a reasonable explanation for why they were living with the family. I feel this can be said to a lesser extent for most people. I'm much more agreeable, I use less slang, and just generally act different at my job where I spend most of my waking hours. Yeah occasionally the real me comes through when around good friends at work but still i have to act the part so my corporate overlords will allow me to maintain the life I've become accustomed to outside of work.  He was practicing his sprinting because he never got over losing to Jesse Owens He made that pressure feel so real. When Chris starts yelling at Rose, my first thought was, 'dude, chill, her parents are going to think you're crazy.' Immediately followed by 'wait fuck that, kill these people.' Get out 2: Chris dates another white chick.

Spoiler: They're just racist not evil. Get Out 2: Get Outter I don't think they were strangers at all. They definitely knew each other - did you see how Walter/Grandpa greeted some of the guests? They were all treated like old friends. They probably had just recently seen each other when Andre was auctioned off, so no need for in-depth conversation. Oh fuck. I just got it. 

Auction, like a slave auction But does he have a ring tho ? Good point. I wonder if the whole thing with unplugging the phone and stuff was her trying to flash herself maybe, but ultimately failing each time? I dunno.  I think she is most certainly a psychopath.  I'm still debating if the rest of the family are also psychopaths or just, like... greedy and brainwashed?  But Rose was definitely a psychopath.  You can't do what her role was while feeling emotions.  Her reaction, or lack there of, to the deer was just her literally not giving a shit.  Holy shit, you weren't wrong. He missed so much from the movie (he states that guy kidnapped at the beginning isn't seen again, when he shows up in a pivotal scene later on), and he calls *Little Man* ingenious. 

Does anyone actually take this guy seriously, or does he get off on being a troll? The blind guy did say it was a *genetic* condition.

But yeah, there's a ton I didn't see coming and even a lot that I didn't get until I read all the comments in this discussion. What did the counting represent? Bids (as in like thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars?) Haha, true.  I totally forgot about his inquiry 

I feel like that guy recently married in and is still trying to be convinced whether or not his life would be easier as a black guy before he signs up for this whole thing I think I totally missed the magic part I actually thought it would end with the cops finding him after killing everyone and the house burned down so he has no evidence of what they were doing. When she googled top NCAA prospects the entire audience died of laughter  And all the guests arrived in black cars. Nothing was by accident. I thought it was more that he wanted Chris's body to be better at MMA. He was drooling at the thought of having that genetic makeup and how much better he could be. There already was. He used it on Andre in the beginning of the movie. As soon as he brought up BJJ I knew he was the guy in the white car This is hilarious given the post that it's in, but it actually is good to see other black people talking about normal black things on Reddit. LOL,  it looked like she was natural in the pic with Rose! Actually the people he would of been written it for could easily expect to live to age 70 and higher.  Life expectancy using deaths of people under the age of 5 is not that good of an indication of the true age of death.

Also while they would of been missing some teeth the majority of them would not of been missing all their teeth aka been toothless. And as /u/dudefreebox pointed out it was a bit of genius because we typically view the police arriving as a ""happy ending"" but the race of the characters turned that on its head.  The end of that phone conversation got the absolute biggest laughs in our theater. I tried not to be loud and covered my mouth but I was still laughing for a solid ten seconds.

She really did play it smooth. It probably would have almost worked on anyone *but* Rod That was Caleb Landry Jones, who also played Banshee in X-Men: First Class.

The guy is a fantastic actor, I'm really hoping he starts to get his foot in more gigs because he has some serious talent. He reminds me of a young Heath Ledger.  Did you see the seamless sharing of all of life's wildest moments through a Windows Phone though? I'm going to get one tomorrow. Just after I bing where best to purchase one. Bing sure makes shopping around a whole lot easier! Microsoft definitely paid to have product placement for the film. Granted it didn't show the Windows phone in a particularly good light... Accidentally uses camera flash in broad daylight, becomes unplugged easily and loses its charge. This movie gave me anxiety that I've never even felt before by having to watch this dude go through such an uncomfortable experience talking to the family. 

I'm also biracial, but I feel like being dark-skinned would bring out a way deeper level of bias from other people. My race is way more ambiguous, and people make fewer assumptions because of that-- which I'm glad about.  It would suck to be pigeonholed over and over again like he was, especially in such a creepy and foreboding setting. This shit really got to me, man. A+ movie.  I just saw the movie tonight so I'm a little late to the party. My added reasoning as to why he got out of the car is because he was trying to make up for not going out and looking for his mom when she was hit by a car and left to die.  Oh I'm staying far away from any kind of china cups and flatware.  Every black person knows someone working in the TSA, fact Then why were they so freaking weird when talking? It seemed like they had been trained on what to say.  And grandpa also trained because he wasn't over having gotten beat by a black man  Most people have to act nicer in front of family. That's something that applies to most people. 

Having to act white instead of how you are used to acting is not as universal as you think  Holy shit. ""You know I can't give you the keys, right babe?""

queue stomach drop.  > unplugging the phone and stuff was her trying to flash herself maybe, but ultimately failing each time? 

I viewed it as them keeping his battery drained. I mean, if you're gonna kidnap someone like that, you don't want his phone to be able to make calls. >or the recent Eddie Murphy films (The Klumps, Norbit, Meet Dave, A Thousand Words) that are so personal and ingenious, they transcend racial categorization.
But unlike Eddie Murphy, a masterful actor with a mature sense of humor, Peele fails because has not created credible characters.


                                                    wat?  

Why would anyone knowingly employ this guy as a film reviewer?


Edit: Jesus Christ, he called ""My Life as a Zucchini"" an anime on his Twitter.  Rotten Tomatoes seriously needs to stop counting his reviews. Yes. It was a silent auction. He's also a super old asian man with a heavy accent. In his home country there might still be overt racism. And he's probably experienced racism first hand in the States. If he thinks black people have it worse than Asian people, why would he want to plop his brain in a black body? Yep. As soon as the father knocked down that candle and set the house on fire that's exactly where I saw the ending heading. Very nice reversal, played me like a fiddle. *Bing'd Wow, you're so right. White people traveling in black vessels. Yikes.  When she started yelling ""help, please help"" I instantly thought ""He's fucked. He was this close to escaping all this."" This movie really got me involved with the plot. I loved it! I was about to dismiss this with an eyeroll, but then I realized my friend's boyfriend just started working for TSA. damn As messed up as that sounds, it is kinda true.

My friend got let go from TSA awhile back.  Just found a few days ago, another friend of mine got a new job, at TSA. They were old white people acting like they thought young black people would, of course shit they say is going to come off sounding weird.  Enh.. might be part of the process the other black dude that knew was acting weird too,especially when he asked him to answer that question at the party.  Woooooooooow that's why he was running. I didn't even register that.  That was an auction without talking.  It wasn't a ""silent auction"", which a specific and different thing. I missed it, but Keegan Michael Key was apparently one of the ""prospects."" I noted that he said that the African American experience had been great for him ... Because he literally was an old white guy sampling the ""African American experience"" If you look at the way he was running as well, he was running like a sprinter. The movie is so full of tidbits that all add up when you put them together, I love it! ",1
53,"2020’s utopias ranked -

1) **AMERICAN UTOPIA** - David Byrne’s life affirming wiggle jam. Brilliantly simple, it left me with a smile I still can’t wipe from my face. 

2) **UTOPIA AVENUE** - David Mitchell’s moving and historical deep dive into the formation of a fictional late 60’s prog-rock band. 

3) **UTOPIA** - a show on Amazon Prime. I was fortunate to be able to see the touring concert version of American Utopia in 2018, and I'm so glad I can now revisit that experience over and over from my couch. This was a much-needed mood booster to close out 2020. Spike coming out swinging with that George Floyd tribute. Great film Pure bliss. I started a rewatch within an hour after finishing it. Can’t wait for more. I’m very tempted to buy tickets for Broadway in 2021 (already on sale starting Sept. 2021) hoping the world is back to normal. David Byrne is just the best kind of weird Missed this thread, but I watched it live. I’m a huge Talking Heads fan who will turn Stop Making Sense on whenever I just need something on, so I’m **incredibly** biased, but I absolutely loved this. And funny enough, IMO, the solo work was 1000x better than the Talking Heads material (with the exception of Once in a Lifetime and I Zimbra). Blind was amazing with the shadows, and I am now obsessed with Jacquelene Acevedo (the female percussionist).

Overall just gives me good feelings. Loved this but also hate how much it makes me wish I was at a concert right now. Absolutely loved this. It felt fresh, lively, upbeat, and delightful to watch. The band was amazing; everyone was in sync, and the renditions of some of the old Talking Heads songs were great. Spike Lee’s direction was fantastic as well. I love how he didn’t just put a camera in front of the stage; the way he shot it really added to the energy of the show. The overhead shots in particular were really well-done. 

Also- This Must Be the Place is the most perfect song ever recorded imo, and their performance here was just euphoric. Worth the watch just for that part alone. No spoilers but should I watch Stop Making Sense before watching this? The pure musicianship on display was just amazing to see, especially since haven’t been able to experience a live concert in 6+ months. This is the exact sort of movie I wanted this year. It's full of hope and good vibes but also doesn't ignore the issues America is facing. David Byrne is such a unique but magnetic front man. It genuinely felt like a sequel to Stop Making Sense. I saw the show live a couple years ago but as a concert, and the added sort of narrative and the way it wrapped and tied things up with how it began really added a lot to what I already thought was a perfect show

losing 'brain connections' as we grow up and the idea of getting them back but on the outside by just relating to each other in a better way, while even having a bit in the middle, which ties to a song, about trying to do so with technology and tv but failing

it's just so well thought-out and constructed, specially considering these songs weren't originally intended to tie this way at all or nothing

not a particularly original or super deep message, but it's just delivered in a beautiful way, and it's the cherry on top of already the best show I've ever seen live and a fucking insane display of musical prowess

beautiful I watched Stop Making Sense over the summer, loved it, thought it was genuinely fantastic and probably the best concert film I had seen. 

That being said, I think I loved this even more. The visuals alone were worth being sold on, with David Byrne & Spike Lee both being visual geniuses, so putting them together was bound to create a cool result. 

Entertaining, great music, and a powerful message, this is easily one of my favorite films of the year. A worthwhile modern successor to Stop Making Sense.  It’s just delightful. It's been months since I last worked at a live concert, let alone went to one for fun. This really made me miss live performances and being at one, and plus I stan David Byrne hard. Amazing show Stop Making Sense is one of my all time favorite films and this felt like such a unique modern way of doing it. I love how spare the staging is so you can see how complex the movements and lighting cues were. The chains were great and there was constant reinvention on how they were used which I loved. 

Also me and my boyfriend have decided that ""our song"" is Road to Nowhere so we were super happy it capped off the show! Byrne was in my city summer of 2018 preforming this show, but I was out of town for a wedding. So extremely bummed I wasn't able to see this live. I wonder why Spike Lee chose this project. I'm not casting aspersions on either Byrne or Lee, they're both great artists, but it's an unexpected collaboration, isn't it? This is a guy who’s singing and dancing on a theater stage ... for those who don’t know what they’re getting into. Reposting what I posted about this fantastic movie last week (tl;dr one of my favourite films of the year and maybe the most joyful film I've seen in a long time):

>I just watched it today at the London Film Fest and I don't think there's gonna be another movie this year that'll make me feel the way this movie did. From the infectious music to the surreal choreography to the crowd reactions (sometimes the camera itself take the perspective of an audience member), you can feel so much joy and energy within the movie. I also loved the way it highlights each background performer, making it feel less like they're a bunch of disparate props but an actual community of people who are working together and with Byrne. The movie does have some emotional but necessary moments, specifically a cover of Janelle Manoe's Hell You Talmbout, that adds to Byrne's (and Lee's) plea to create an American utopia, where people are able to truly connect and empathize with each other.

>It's my favourite Spike Lee film of the year and amongst his best ever. Just watched it, amazing film. Even though I never saw the live version (I'm in Brazil and I couldn't afford it when the tour came this way in 2018), I'm a huge fan of the original album and of the cast recording, and I plan to catch it at least once in 2021, when the Broadway run restarts. 

Part of the spectacle is how Lee chose to film the show: there are some cool weird angles and unexpected zooms that really complement the whole thing. I didn't love the banter in-between songs (they didn't really make the gig flow, with one or two exceptions) but it's nothing that made it worse. The performance of Janelle Monae's ""Hell You Talmbout"" was powerful, with pictures of the people mentioned in the lyrics being shown on screen.

The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that a few songs were abridged, such as ""Everyday Is A Miracle"" (a whole verse and chorus were cut). I was also expecting ""The Great Curve"" to be part of the encore as it is in the album. where can I watch this? I have loved David Byrne since listening to a cassette of Little Creatures at a friend's house in the mid 80s.

I enjoyed the film immensely. I really like the speaking sections which gently guided the narrative.

I was fortunate enough to watch the film as part of the London Film Festival and there was a recorded interview with David before they showed the film. He talked about how he wasn't there to preach, rather show than tell. Seeing a diverse group of people create something wonderful and joyful was the message.

Also, David said you were meant to experience it as though you were in the audience or on the stage, that it was the real thing.

So, I thought the section with big red writing and all the photos was jarring. It went against the subtlety of the rest of performance. The music behind it was beautiful, and I think it would have been just as powerful without. The song's lyrics were ""say his name"", or ""say her name"". We didn't need to show their face. It was incongruous with the lyrics and the rest of the show. They also added George Floyd who had died since the performance, and wasn't named in the song. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but it felt unnecessary. If they were adding to the names to make it more current, or to tap into the present feeling, I don't think that was needed. It's a powerful song as it is, and I wonder whether it diminishes it.

The sound they all make together is really great, the sound crew did an amazing job.

Also, I love it whenever David picks up a guitar.

Overall I really enjoyed the film. I took my son to see it, and I really hoped he would pick up some of the love of weirdness, great musicianship, freedom, joy, ambiguity, beautiful presentation and performance. We'll see. Just wonderful. I've a feeling Jonathan Demme would've really loved this. Would be interesting if this won Best Documentary thus giving Spike Lee his 1st win for a film. My friend and I reviewed this for [our podcast about documentaries. ](https://anchor.fm/doc-pod/episodes/David-Byrnes-American-Utopia-2020-el8tob) Definitely watch Stop Making Sense if you haven’t! This film is entirely different but they’re definitely in conversation with one another. It’s good not great imo. Okay, but how much drugs was that guy at the end of the show on? I'm surprised they got jennifer Lawrence on cowbell. Wasn't expecting that! Im an 80s baby, so although I was too young to understand what these songs were about when I first heard them, these were some of the first songs I ever heard. 

Seeing and hearing David Byrne in “American Utopia”  brought back an immense amount of nostalgia for me, leaving me in awe-filled chills the entire time. 

“Once in a Lifetime” (heard in the car as a toddler on a car ride with entire family) and “Road to Nowhere” (first heard when watching “Little Monsters” as a kid) have been songs that have gotten me through some of the toughest times in my life, and also helped me ride the wave in some of the best.  

The power and message behind this entire performance was so strong that, by the time the ending approached, and “Road to Nowhere” started playing, the tears just released.  

Nostalgia, missing how things used to be with family, wishing for peace and justice, David Byrne’s voice. This is one of the best performances I’ve ever watched. So thankful! I saw the tour live as well and it was really great, one of the best concerts I've seen. It's inevitable that things like this will get compared to Stop Making Sense but that tour really deserved the comparison. I'm excited to watch the film Go see this on Broadway if you haven't yet! There was a good interview with Spike Lee and David Byrne. Spike Lee was like ""You didn't hire me just to point a camera at the stage, I don't roll like that!"" and he was cracking up David Byrne and the interviewer. I would! I think they're definitely in dialogue with one another. Plus, Stop Making Sense rules and you should take any chance you can to watch it. It's the best concert film ever, everyone should make time for it regardless! There was a tribute to Jonathan Demme in the credits! I really think Spike is carrying on his legacy in live performance. His doc Passing Strange is incredible. New York. Dance. Performance. Creatives in common.

Lee's filmography is way diverse and Byrne has his irons in lots of different fires. There's a BLM protest song that has a very Spike Lee editing style. Clearly a big driver. 

But also Lee has become a big fan of stage recording with Passing Strange, Rodney King, and Pass Over. And this is a show all about multiculturalism and the power of diverse voices working together. And Byrne uses it for voting pledges and signups! I can see why he dug this one a lot. besides everything already said, watch it till the end. It has a big part of it relating to current events. The show is pretty political especially towards the end which is Spike's MO They’re both in NYC and came up around the same time. Lee has an affinity for people who lived in NYC around the time he did as well as anything NYC. See also: how he bonded with John Turturro and  the non race relation movies he’s done like 25th Hour. I don’t doubt Lee likes to be on Broadway in someway. In what ways is it unexpected? HBO Max The post says Disney+ but I was looking around and I think it’s actually HBO Max I appreciated David using his platform to support BLM, and I thought that section of the film was very impactful. I thought adding Floyd and Brianna Taylor in there really hit home. This has been an issue for so long, and 2020 has really thrust it into the spotlight. I think drawing such attention to it with the photos and red letters was a good choice and fit the themes of the show. This is not a message to be delivered subtly in my eyes. Definitely respectfully disagree on the part showing their faces. I believe that part was *meant* to be jarring, and expressed the theme of the show extremely well. The entire show had an overt political message, saying that we need to realize each other’s humanity. Each of those people they showed were demonized after death by half of the country. Forcing the viewer to see their faces in the midst of a show about human connection was a powerful way to connect those themes to current events, and to humanize real victims who many refuse to empathize with due to their political beliefs. I loved it. Concert films aren't up for Best Documentary. And this is a TV film that aired on HBO (like with Bad Education) so it wouldn't be eligible either way. Like with Hamilton, this will be in next year's Emmys. Spike already has an Oscar I thought it was fantastic! Definitely one of the most entertaining concert movies I've seen. Stop Making Sense is great too, and I'll have to watch that one again, but this one honestly could top it in my eyes. timestamp? i must have missed it! >I don’t doubt Lee likes to be on Broadway in someway.

Quite, given that this isn't the first unorthodox Broadway show that he has filmed. I'm not sure it delivered anything we didn't already know.

It didn't add anything emotionally for me that I hadn't felt in other parts of the performance.

It was incongruous, for the reasons I outlined above.

The people in the audience weren't seeing what we were seeing. It felt shoehorned in. Actually, it felt plastered on, obscuring the performance.

I couldn't read all the names, dates that were in front of me and listen to the words, or take in all the names in red. The song is meant to be about clarity, about not missing, overlooking, or being overwhelmed, it's trying to draw attention to the individuals. But the effect of the photos and words was the opposite. I felt it was very heavy handed.

I don't think people who watch this are going to need convincing. Dang,too good to be true. Not for directing or film,it was for wrirung. Ok...it wasn't really her. It just looked like her :) > thus giving Spike Lee his 1st win for a film.

He won for writing...writing a film. All Oscars are for films, and he has already won. Would def be great to see him land a Best Director or Best Pic (or even Best Doc, I suppose) at some point though. ",0
108,"I love how Miles copied the moves of the deceased Spider-Man at the end to climb the collider and the others are just staring, wondering who taught him that. It was an extremely cool callback to the beginning and oddly heartwarming. We complained about how many times we had to watch Uncle Ben die, and now we’re being punished by having to watch Peter Parker die twice in one year  I think one of my favorite parts of the movie was that while it managed to be hilarious and silly, but they never undercut the important moments with humor. The film took itself seriously when it needed to.  Doc Ock's design is RIDICULOUSLY thoughtful and wonderful. Her plasticky/rubbery arms move more like an octopus than regular ock's. And the hair in profile looks just like an octopus head. I'm so happy Liv exists. I loved that Jake-Spider-man was so experienced that everything was monotonous, but he had the skill to back it up, and I love that he was still supportive of Miles even while saying that he wasn't going to the final battle.

Like, as he grabbed him and said ""So just show me that you can turn invisible or use your venom strike on command or *something* to get by me."" This film had so many great moments:

* Each Spider person's history being essentially the same but still giving depth and background to each character.
* Everything Spider-Noir
* Pete and Miles relationship development. ""I'm so proud of you!... Do I want kids?!""
* ""*Sleeeeeeep*""
* The animation and montage when Miles creates the suit and swings through the city the first time

I could go on and on. This film is incredible. I really hope that people go and see it so that Sony Animation continues to make these as you could tell they really put some heart and soul into this one. Am I the only one that was kind of scared of miles uncle lmao his theme song when he was chasing him was scary I can’t believe they referenced the Spider-Man pointing meme ""That's all Folks""

""Is he allowed to say that? Like, legally?"". Just got out from the first showing at my theater. Really visually great and funny movie! I wish our latter three Spiders got showcased some more but this movie was pretty long as it is I guess.

I’d be all up for more inter-dimensional shenanigans in a sequel.

Stay for the credits! This movie deserves an Oscar  [deleted] Everyone is rightfully praising all the Spider-People, but I was so happy they got the villains right. Kingpin taking up the entire frame! Green Goblin being an actual GOBLIN! The Doc Oc reveal!!!  The Prowler would have to be my favorite though. I loved the animation of his movement. I loved the score that accompanied him whenever he showed up. And I REALLY loved that they made him actually SCARY - wasn’t expecting genuine jump scares in this movie. I’ll be seeing this a dozen more times. ""SPIDER-MAN POINTED FIRST, OBVIOUSLY"" Couldn't stop laughing at that whole bit. Best part: when they’re running out of Alchemax, Miles throws a bagel back at the scientists, and it hits one in the head followed by the little comic bubble saying “*Bagel!*” ""Ok one of us has to be responsible and sacrifice themself to get the rest home"" 

*all Spider-people simultaneously volunteer without hesitation*

FUCK these guys get it I couldn't believe they actually officially addressed the emo dance scene.  Drinking game for everything Kingpin shows up in: Take a drink every time he says VANESSA! Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had to pay the ultimate price and die for this film to be made. That 2099 tease. You whip out Oscar Issac to torture us? Sony should stick to this form of filmmaking for the Spider-Man universe and let Marvel Studios handle the live action adaptions. Stuff like this is super heartfelt and original, loved every minute of it.

Had me rolling with “I found out I was dead. And blonde.” Kingpin is an absolute U N I T Absolutely AMAZING. I swear I can make a poster out of every scene of this movie. It’s just stunningly beautiful. Love the characters. Love the humor. Love the actions and fighting sequences. I love this movie. 

(I can’t really believe this came out of the same studio that made the emoji movie.)

 Okay but how fucking amazing was that title sequence That after credits scene was pure perfection, I love it when the memes become self-aware. Can I just say it’s insane how prolific Spider-Man got in roughly a decade in Miles’s universe. He’s 26 and has his own merchandise, INCLUDING comics while still being considered a vigilante by law enforcement. That’s nuts. I love how they introduced every new version of Spider-Man by recapping what had happened to them. It was different each time, yet by the time we come to the last ones, it's almost a running gag because it was pretty much the same in every timeline and it's like you're a part of an inside joke.  Did anyone notice Peter Porker eating a hotdog when he got back to his universe?  **Doc Ock**: My friends call me Liv, my enemies call me Doc Ock.

*Later in the film*

**Aunt May**: Oh great, it's Liv

🤔
 ""I did this *finger guns at people in the street* but we don't talk about it"" This movie handles death *really* well.

Isnt it amazing how we knew the blonde Spider-Man less than *five* minutes and we immediately understand why he's a big deal. When he dies, it feels real.

We got *two* movies with Superman in his newer films, and when they killed him off in the end of BvS, I felt nothing.

Or I'll take it further. I felt more about Uncle Aaron's death than I ever did about Gwen Stacy's in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

More screentime doesnt mean more empathy. 
 I like how Peni Parker's mouth never synced up with what she was saying, that was a clever bit  Convince me that this isn't a lock for Best Animated Picture

&#x200B;

Edit: LET'S GO!!! Almost every frame from the supercollider final fight scene was breathtaking, god I want so many more of these movies already! “CAN YOU FLOAT THROUGH THE AIR WHEN YOU SMELL A DELICIOUS PIE?”

Cracked me up. The meta references to the franchise really had me laughing from the start! Lots of heart and the animation was incredible - some parts had me forgetting it wasn’t live action. 

Never thought I’d hear Biggie on a Spider-Man soundtrack!  Of course John Mulaney's first big film role is in a movie where the plot revolves around characters' lives being in jeopardy because they were taken to a secondary location. Wow! This might be one of my favorites of the year. Visually stunning, hilarious, and so full of heart. Some of my favorite stuff in no particular order:

-all the intro sequences for all the Spider-People were a fun way to give backstory for each character 

-Kingpin being an absolute unit was ridiculous and hilarious 

-all the voice actors for the supporting Spider-People were fantastic, Nic Cage and John Mulaney were especially perfect. 

definitely need to see this again, one of if not the best Spider-Man movie  It’s still feels unreal to finally see a Spider-Man on the big screen that actually represents me... an early 30s skinny fat guy who eats cheeseburgers for breakfast If you know nothing about Spider-Man, this is an excellent movie. A real triumph.

If you know a little bit about Spider-Man, this is *a* perfect movie.

If you can name more than five Spider-Man villains, this is *the* perfect movie. Peter B. Parker is going to supplant Deadpool as the most popular Marvel costume at conventions the moment every Spidey fan without the body of a Greek god realizes they can convincingly cosplay him in spandex.

This is not a complaint. If I was still into comics enough to attend cons, I would be purchasing a costume this second. I'd like to talk about the ""Act 3 suit up"" sequence where Miles makes a suit and actually starts using his powers.

Soooooo many of these movies do this, and I feel this was the only one to really get it right. That Stan Lee cameo absolutely tore me up. Spiderman was like his son that didnt really exist, and the first new thing I hear from Stan since he died is him talking about how he's going to miss him?

Jeez. When Miles just slapped the Spider from his hand after being bit, I almost fell out of my chair. I knew RIGHT then that I was going to love this movie. I just now realized that the spider that bit Miles was glitching. Like it didn't belong in his universe. It had numbers on it. Does anyone know which universe that spider came from?  People are missing the craziest thing about this movie: they pull off, like, half-a-dozen supervillains. Overstuffing has been the downfall of more superhero movies than Zack Snyder I love how Noir couldn't solve a rubix cube, because he only sees black and white. Holy shit. *Holy holy holy shit.*

So many things to say about that movie.

&#x200B;

Did *anyone* ever expect to be getting *anything* like this when the trailers dropped last year?

Gorgeous visuals, *great* use of music to heighten these characters. (When I heard Big Poppa arrive for Uncle Aaron, it caught me off-guard with its abruptness.)

Speaking of: this movie actually feels like the stakes are real.  And the fact that they *did* that with all of this space time continuum nonsense is a miracle. I was never concerned about the possibility of a Thanos snap being erased here, the stakes felt real.

And it was properly brutal, which I was pleasantly surprised to see for a PG rated film. They don’t really hold back all that much here. Kingpin literally *kills* the original Spider-Man of Miles’ world.

And the Uncle Aaron as *Prowler* reveal? Hooboy. My heart sank for Miles.

Let’s talk about *badass Aunt May!*

That. May. Be. My. Single most. FAVORITE. Version of her.

No more platitudes, no more being elderly and almost completely defenseless. THIS version is incredible.

I could write a book with how much I loved this movie…it’s *absurd.*

&#x200B; I’m still laughing at aunt May asking her house not be destroyed and Spider Ham is breaking dishes over his head while everyone else is fighting.  That movie was fucking incredible. Holy shit. The soundtrack was sooooo good and I loved all the references/memes (Spiderman sitting at the desk). The visuals were incredible, too. Almost always nighttime, but so bright and vivid. I loved at the beginning how we saw alternate universe versions of the Marvel/Sony Pictures/etc logos. I'm so incredibly happy I saw this. The best animated film I've ever seen. Easily. It's mind-boggling how great this looks.

And to top it, an incredibly well written and engaging story, chock full of heart and emotion. This has honestly made me forget the MCU Spidey in terms of what they can now do with the character. 

Film of the year.  I loved the use of Chris Pine as Spider-Man in Miles’s universe. He sounds a lot like Jake Johnson to help sell that they’re both Peter Parker

Easily the most fun I’ve had in a movie theater this year. Watch it on the biggest screen possible and try to catch all the background jokes when they show Times Square (my favorites: Clone College, based on Lord and Miller’s short-lived MTV series Clone High; an EA Sports Water Polo ad; and a Seth Rogen horse racing comedy) This is the new gold standard for comic-book movies, ESPECIALLY animated ones. They did such great justice to Miles and Gwen. Animation, acting and soundtrack were tremendous. Can't wait to see again ASAP and I will, with my shoe untied and Spidey hoodie up. I had high expectations for this movie and man it just straight up SHATTERED it. I love this movie so much. Can't wait to watch it again I can't believe the studio that made The Emoji Movie made the best Spider-Man movie. Well that was literally everything I wanted it to be. Fuck.  Forget best *animated* super hero movie - this was just one of the best super hero movies ever. 2018: the year they killed Peter Parker twice.

* The animation style may not be for everyone but I really dug it.

* There were *so many* Easter eggs and inside jokes, both Spidey ones (like the PS4 suit) and non-Spidey ones (like ""From Dusk Till Shaun""). I'll rewatch this just to see all the hidden details. Seriously, I could talk for an hour about all the homages and references.

* Loved all the Spiders. Miles was fantastic, both Peters were great, Gwen was perfect. I want a whole movie of Spider-Man Noir being dark and gritty: ""Sometimes I watch matches burn until they touch my fingers just so I can feel again."" And fucking Spider-Ham, man...

* I don't watch a lot of animated movies, but I liked that they didn't shy away from death. Peter's death actually got a little jump scare from me.

There's *so much* crazy shit in this movie, but somehow it all flows together and doesn't interfere with Miles' story. In fact, the strength of Miles' story is what glues the film together. Absolutely loved this movie. I take back everything I've ever said about Sony. A+ Genuinely one of the best films I've seen this year, and certainly one of the most visually striking ones I've seen in a while.

I couldn't help but just feel so impressed by the animation and how it looked, yet I couldn't quite put my finger on how it was made, like it just looked so polished and unique, whilst feeling totally right for the film and in a way that isn't distracting despite it's vibrancy.

And the visuals certainly aren't let down by the writing, every beat in this film felt perfectly placed and escalated in a way that felt natural and built to something truly spectacular.

I know I sound a bit silly enthusing so much about it but I genuinely really, really, loved it, and can't really fault it thinking about it now.

10/10 would watch again!!! Unpopular opinion: I wouldn’t be upset if this was Stan Lee’s last cameo. While the MCU ones always draw cheers and a laugh, this one felt more fitting of a send-off, speaking words of wisdom to his most-beloved creation, and us the fans, as we are all Spider-Man. I will continue to enjoy his appearances as long as they last, but I doubt that the Far From Home one will carry as much emotional weight.  Just watched it a couple hours ago.

Watch it. Just go watch it. Easily the best animated film I've ever seen and just all-round awesome.

Visuals are comic-style drawings on acid. Right from the intro you know what you're gonna get is awesome. Really engaging plot, graphics are mind-blowing, hits you in the feels and the final battle is nuts. Still buzzing from the film, though to be fair that could be the coffee I just drank. Stay for the post-credit scene. 

Stop reading this and go watch it.  Best Spider-Man movie we’ve gotten from Sony!  The end credit scene had me laughing the hardest I have at any movie.  [deleted] I loved the references to the old toby maguire movies. ""Yea we dont really talk about this."" Lol Immersion ruined when the usb stick went in on the first try. I love how terrifying Prowler was. My heart was racing through that subway scene! The big reveal of him being the uncle was spectacular. Phil Lord will get a lifetime pass from me for whatever he wants to do.  Because he understood something about Spider-Man that no other filmmaker up to this point really seemed to understand:

""New York"" is as vital a character to the creation of Spider-Man as any of his respective family members, or villains.  New York informed who he was, and who he would become.  Neighborhoods, and boroughs, and streets.  How the buildings of midtown spread out like a web, and inform the process of traversing the city.  How some areas are simply too far to swing, and how public transit becomes a vital necessity.  The fashions and the people.  The wide exposure to different cultures, the foods and restaurants and smells.  The neon glow at night and the hum of humanity during the day.  The taxis and police officers and everything else.  It was all there, and it MATTERED for once.  New York mattered to the story.

God, I loved this movie.  Everything was just... perfect.  And you cared about Miles so much.  You hurt when he hurt, and you rejoiced when he finally took his leap of faith.

I loved it.  I hope you loved it.  Phil Lord made magic with this movie.
 [deleted] #༼ ◕_ ◕ ༽つ HEY Bro talk about the coincidental timing of Stan Lee’s cameo..... that shit was lined up perfectly and it really hit me. RIP YO WTF 

This movie was incredible. I loved every second of it.

Sony. You’ve found your niche. Forget live action Spider-Man movies. Make more animated Spider-Man movies and I’ll be there multiple times to see each one. >Movie is visual porn

>Kingpin is an absolute unit

>Use of Biggie’s “Hypnotized”

>Tear jerking cameo from Stan lee

>Fat, homeless, heartbroken, sweat pants wearing, Spider-Man is the best Spider-Man 

>Spider-Man Noir has the funniest lines. All hail Nicolas Cage 

>Thought Spider-Ham was going to be an annoying but he was the second funniest character

Noir wasn't in this movie long but my god did he steal the show I saw this movie at a test screening back in July - I’m pretty sure our screening was one of the first ones they did. It was torture not being able to share my love for this film for so long. For the curious, here’s all the things I can remember that were different from the test screening: 

- they cut a heart to heart scene between Peter and Miles that happened on a roof - I believe it occurs after Aaron dies but its been awhile so I could be getting the timing wrong. For the life of me I don’t remember exactly what they were saying but I remember being moved by this scene so I was very upset they cut it. It actually kind of affected my viewing experience this time around because I kept waiting for it to come on. I’m pretty sure peter was apologizing for being a shitty teacher and ruminating on his mistakes with MJ but it’s pretty fuzzy in my memory. (Edit: someone in the comments reminded me that this is the scene where Peter says “you don’t have to save the whole world, just focus on saving one person”)

- they also cut a lot out of the sequence where the spider crew sneaks into fisks gala. You know the line where they go “it can’t be that easy”? Yeah, the joke in the test screening was it WASNT that easy because the henchmen basically immediately realize who they are and say something to the effect of “do you think we’re stupid or something? Obviously we’re not gonna fall for the fact that y’all are waiters” I can’t really remember how they end up escaping - miles may have rescued them? I honestly can’t remember though since it’s been so long. 

- Peter porker had a lot of his best lines cut which I was DEVASTATED about because they were some of my favorite parts. There’s a scene where he talks about one of his family members dying and he describes the smell as singed bacon. It’s hard to describe but the shock factor of that line was sooo hysterical. He also says fuck at one point, but it pops up as a bunch of “f*^%#!” symbols in the speech bubble that appears so it’s just implied. 

- the end scene where adult Peter reconnects with MJ wasn’t there, in the test screening I saw it just shows him calling her at the very end. I like this change a lot better because it’s a more satisfying resolution for him. 

- in my test screening almost the entire climax was in storyboards so there’s a ton of stuff they changed from that - but it’s way too many random little things for me to remember. 

If I remember anything else I’ll update this. And if anyone else was in a test screening and remembers that Peter/ Miles scene on the roof, please let me know because it’s killing me that I can’t remember exactly when that scene took place.  That was the most emotional eye candy I've ever seen and I loved it. That Stan Lee cameo hit me the hardest for sure Underrated gag: Kingpin getting out of an SUV he so clearly can't even fit into. I didn't shed a tear during the whole of Infinity War, but man, for some reason I choked up hard after OG Peter's death in this film. The montage of horrified and heartbroken reactions to the news of his death from all the various people around the city really drove home just how much impact Spider-Man had and how much he was a staple to New York. Then they hit you with the one-two punch of MJ and Stan Lee and I was bawling like a baby, I'm not ashamed to say it. When Spider-Gwen told Miles: “nice suit” and he replied “thanks, I made it myself.” 

Sorry MCU, but that’s my spidey.  Definitely the most gorgeous animated film I’ve ever seen. I went into it expecting it to be visually good but still be a shallow kids’ story, but the characters and story blew me away. Obviously it’s no deep character study or something, but the character development and plot were both more than good. Definitely an enjoyable film.  I can't believe they pulled that off. I know Lord and Miller only had writing/producer credits on this one, but this proves that they really are the closest American analogs to Edgar Wright. Nobody does visual humor/comedic timing quite like they do I was not ready for the emotional tidal wave that I felt when Stan showed up. Theres Meme refrences in this movie. In a year with both Ready Player One and Ralp Breaks the Internet. If you told me i would laugh at a meme refrence in a spiderman movie i would say fuck off. But there i was laughing like an idiot at meme refrences. Maybe the coolest thing about this movie is that it *had to be animated*. Like, it would not have been possible to tell this story in live action.

They could have simply made a standard Spiderman movie with a cool aesthetic, but they did something way more ambitious than that.

I was expecting the movie to look really good animation-wise, but the quality of the storytelling blew me away. Someone else compared this film to Mad Max: Fury Road and i think it’s an apt comparison. This is popcorn filmmaking firing on all cylinders, it’s basically a perfect animated film. Exceeded all of my expectations

I loved the “I should examine my personal biases” line lmao  Anyone else catch [this clip of Donald Glover from community](https://youtu.be/4RxFCst-jxo?t=2) was playing on the TV at Aaron Davis’ house - the character Donald Glover plays in the MCU. I loved this film.

The style/tone felt so fresh for American animation, there was so much energy and fluidity to it. The film has so much momentum but it manages to squeeze in so many heartfelt storylines. 

I loved the references to Maguire's Spiderman at the start and the arcs everyone went through. Stan Lee's cameo was incredibly heartwarming and had me tearing up. 

Everything felt so witty, subversive and perfectly scripted, all the emotional beats land, whether it be Chris Pine's Spider-Man dying, Johnson's Spider-Man being scared to go back to his life, Miles relationship with his Dad and Uncle. It all felt very genuine, hell even Kingpin gets some genuine motivation. 

It was great to see Miles come into his own at the end, it really felt like having other Spider-people added to his arc rather than taking away from it. 

9/10  Oh my god, spider man 2099 in the 67 series style was HILARIOUS  Was the best movie i have seen in a long time and has easily taken the top spot for marvel based movie.... and it was made by Sony [Kinda spoilers] Just came out of the movies. I cannot express how much I love this movie, it's easily the most visually stunning movie of the year AND the best comic book movie of 2018 hands down. Miles' and Peter's relationship was so heartwarming to see blossom on the big screen. The story was very well done, the characters all felt endearing and lively, the soundtrack was awesome almost better than Black Panther's. And the animation, oh man the animation.. 10/10 Can easily be the best Spider-Man movie ever Idk if anyone noticed, but in the scene when miles first goes to his uncle Aaron’s house, on his tv playing is Donald Glover from community wearing his spider-man pajamas! If I’m not mistaken, that is a great nod to Donald for being inspiration for Miles.  I want this to win Oscar for best animated movie. Totally deserves it this year  If this movie doesn't win best animated feature....then I don't want to live on this planet anymore.


Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.   It really is the perfect animated movie.   It is IMO the best of the Spider-man movies.   It's criminal that this movie is being slept on.  


Also do not miss out on the end credit scene.  Best laugh I've had all year.

 The Stan Lee cameo really cut deep...  This was in my opinion the best Spider-Man film if not best MARVEL comic film to come out. I will die on that hill. 

>Miles: The suit doesn't fit

>Stan: It'll fit, just give it time.

 My movie of the year, 100% Everyone needs to see this film. These are the movies we should support. Not VENOM. 10/10. Great visuals. Great story. And what an after credits! The moment Liv turned out to be Doc Ock is the moment my brain went ""OH SHIT THIS ISNT 616."" God I loved this film.

THE PS4 COSTUME IS IN THERE I, like a lot of people, am a *huge* fan of the MCU. And this movie was so good I was sitting in my seat wondering if we had been doing superhero movies wrong all this time. This movie feels revolutionary.  [deleted] A PG movie had some of the best action sequences of the year I just hope people take note of how good this movie looks. Many surprises and some heavy moments. This is a very well handled movie, emotionally, and technically.

Edit: Oh, and Kingpin looks goofy(my theater giggled whenever he was on screen, but up close his size was definitely intimidating. This is one of the best movies of 2018. I'm not even joking. It was seriously that good! Everything a Spider-Man Comic Book movie should be, and the animation was top notch. Nicholas Cage as Noir Spiderman was an inspired casting choice I love how much of a *thug* this version of Kingpin was. When I first watched the movie, I was caught off guard with his mobster voice. It felt too stereotypical.

Upon my second and third viewing, I started to appreciate this version more and more. He's just such a *huge* force of nature. I can see this guy giving people two options: fight me or take my money and shut up.

This guy doesn't even try to pretend he's less than a vicious thug. Or at the very least, this *universe* is so extreme that a guy like that can get away with being a legitimate businessman. 

Fisk throwing a Spider-Man gala was a fucking genius move by the writers. I'd love to see how a Daredevil would handle this version of Kingpin.

Even though I thought having him *throw a taxi* was going a little *too* far, the movie gets away with it by having it happen when the visuals turned into armageddon. It helped with the suspension of disbelief. 

His design on paper looks *really* over the top, but it works in the context of the film. I loved the touch of giving him a character tic with the clacking pen. He just felt like such a neurotically dangerous guy. 

Kudos to making a solid version of the Kingpin. I'm sorry that music that played whenever the Prowler appeared was fucking terrifying Spiderverse deserves the Oscar for Best Animated film over Incredibles 2. Spider-Man movies ranked

1. Into the Spider-Verse

2. Everything else. Just got out of a screening, and all I can say is, what a time to be comic book fan! Say what you want about Sony’s other forays into Spider-Man films, but this was absolutely fantastic. There’s an incredibly fine line when it comes to going balls-to-the-wall discarding continuity while also keeping things accessible for mainstream consumption, and this movie NAILED it. 

Thrilling, funny, moving, and with some amazingly dark turns I did not see coming, Into the Spider-Verse just had me giddy with excitement. I’m going to write a full review tomorrow, but I have to digest this gem of a film overnight before putting my thoughts down on paper. In 2018, there is a GOOD animated Spider-Man film with Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, and Spider-Ham. That’s unbelievable to me. Go see it! Wasn't expecting to see an in Memoriam for Steve Ditko, especially with Stan Lee's recent passing, but it made me very happy to see that they did it. God I've been waiting for an official discussion for a week and goddamn this is my favorite movie of 2018. The animation and soundtrack was fucking perfect and all the little details that went into the film was so incredible to see. Stan Lee cameo was so awesome and a kind of sad in a way we won't get to hear him voice act, (hopefully) a sequel to this film.  The cinematography was absolutely BEAUTIFUL. 

It’s a shame this movie isn’t making “bonkers” money — especially the dollars that Venom had been making earlier this year. 

If all is right with the awards shows coming up, this movie will be raking in most of the trophies. I didn’t even catch that. Good eye.  Miles applied lots of things he had learned during the end sequence....even from his flawed uncle. I loved it. Dayum this adds another layer to the ""I didn't teach him that"" line after! I thought it was just a simple joke. I love how he says ""I'm better at running than I am at swinging"" and when he becomes Spiderman he incorporates parkour into his webswinging in a way others don't. I loved miles in this film, it took so long for him to become Spider-Man fully but it felt soooo right and deserved when he did because we saw the whole process of him learning it was perfect, him and old Peter were adorable, I loved him turning old Peters lesson back on him. This film was the definition of heartwarming. That's awesome, nice catch! 3 times actually. [deleted] By this point, the movie had already won me over but the part where all the other Spider-People are consoling Miles in his dorm and Spider-Ham speaks up, I was so afraid that they were gonna have him say something funny and completely undermine the tone of that scene. 

I was genuinely shocked when he said ""Miles...sometimes we can't save everybody...""  I appreciated that they knew when to cut a one liner short. “Mine was my uncle Ben.” “Mine was my uncle Benjamin.” was funny (in large part because the death of Uncle Ben isn’t really an emotional focal point for Johnson’s Peter and Noir isn’t a particularly emotional character) but if it had gone further, it would’ve completely drained the scene of its dramatic framework. Having Gwen (and even Spider-Ham) follow it up with real, meaningful advice kept the scene afloat. This movie managed to be both funnier *and* more heartfelt and emotional than I expected. Excellent writing, directing, and acting all around. Right? They don't immediately undercut the seriousness with a lighthearted joke. They take the time to make smart jokes when it fits, and give room for the emotional beats to play out. I personally just found it hilarious that she had an exercise ball in her office that Peter used as a chair. 

Just the image of Doc Ock running a google-style workplace just makes me laugh.  I love how in Spider-Man's plan to get the new Goober, Miles tells him that the lady is probably the lead scientist because she was in his school videos.

Then he says something like ""Step 5: reevaluate my workplace prejudices.""

IE: The men would be in charge, not the lady. I liked how they did both Liv and Gwen.  
(I liked the ballet slippers way better than the Chucks.)  

But both the female characters were made to move noticeably more gracefully than the males.  
Even just hanging in place, Liv was graceful.  

And none of these nods to femininity made the females seem less capable.  Doc Ock actually seemed more menacing because of it. She’s my favorite it’s like 90% design 10% personality. is she in the comics? [deleted] >I loved that Jake-Spider-man was so experienced that everything was monotonous

Same. He was *good* at being Spiderman but bad at being Peter - great part of the character we see in the comics and we never see onscreen. The bravery of the choices made in this - an *animated* film - is fucking astounding.    Their relationship was so good! I loved how much growth they both had gone through by the end.  I love how that trait wasn't unique to JakeSpider either. You could tell the other spider people pretty desperately *wanted* Miles to succeed, but kept up an appearance of harsh reality until he proved himself, as they all had gone through their own learning period as well.

The whole ""you're like me"" bit was so great at establishing the immediate connection between them. You could so instantly tell how much relief and understanding they felt in those moments and the amount of times they repeat it really builds the relationships so well. I cracked up at the part where he predicted Kingpin saying in a very cliche manner ""you have 24 hours"" Yeah, really like this version of Peter Parker. I hope we get to see more of all the 5 multiverse spiderman and spiderwoman in the future.  He was basically the Archer of Spider-Man, you expect him to be kinda shitty at everything cause he's just a lazy idiot but somehow he's still super good at his job. I’m so happy he figured out the Rubix Cube >Everything Spider-Noir

Take *that y*ou hard-boiled turtle-slapper! I just have so much difficulty imagining that Sony put their heart and soul into _a movie, period._ This might be the first actual time they've ever bothered. It reminded me of the sounds from Annihilation  Honestly he was terrifying Yah that theme gave me chills in the theater.  My girlfriend was so adorable during his scenes hahah. She wasn’t familiar with the character.

Her: *taps me on shoulder* “Who is that?”

Me: “A villain called Prowler.”

Her: “.......he’s scary..” Giving Killmonger a run for his money for best villain theme. It was extremely unsettling, I loved it  I told my friend that the music was super scary during those chase scenes! I can't believe 2099 was the one to do it. I was howling. Also the desk with picture behind it in the credits.  ""Quit pointing at me!"" I think it was a really intentional, genius way of getting the audience ""on their side"". We've now had FOUR major Spider-Man franchises since the Raimi series so I can imagine how people going into this might be mildly apprehensive. Honestly I had mid-tier expectations but ended up loving every moment of it. I think that self-aware jab at the emo dance meme was a low-key brilliant way to allow the viewer to sink into the story and let go of any preconceived ideas. At least it did that for me! Question: I know Mulaney was the voice, and that he genuinely sounds like this, but I’m wracking my brain trying to remember which classic cartoon character he sounds like.  Are others aware of this?

EDIT:  Not necessarily “classic” I realize, but it just hit me:   Timon from lion king.  As you were everyone. Hey, if DC can get a Stan Lee cameo, then Marvel can get a Porky Pig line, dag-nab-it! Man I know that Spider-Noir is basically this film's version of Lego Batman, but fuck did he make me laugh more than any other character.  i agree, i really wanted more Peni moments so that final scene of her crying for the bot would hit harder.  There's one after the credits.  Word so far is that the sequel is Miles and Gwen having some kind of adventure and getting romantic with each other...can’t wait. My brother said something about the monitor and then Peter threw it out. That's when I knew I was watching a masterpiece.  During the montage of his plan saying he’ll hack the computer and miles corrects him

“That’s not really hacking though...” Absolutely loved the different take on villains. And Doc Oc was definitely the biggest surprise during the movie. I verbally said ""oh shit"" when she said her name I really liked that Kingpin's motivations were simple, but also slightly sympathetic. He wanted to have ""his"" family back and he was willing to do anything to get back what he lost. He had to experience his wife and son walk out on him for his violent behavior towards Spider-Man and then leave him forever, twice. The Doc reveal genuinely surprised me. I don't know if they showed it off in any of the trailers but I didn't except it at all. A few of the designs, like the Goblin, were heavily based on the Ultimate universe that Miles is from which works really well. Though glad they didn't use the Ultimate Scorpion because that would have been...weird.  They made Prowler really cool. Honestly, even during Miles' comic origin, he still felt D-list, and the most intriguing thing about him was that he was Miles' uncle. Here, he felt like a threat.  He's literally in the movie for two seconds and he gets the most JJJ line *ever.*

These fuckers are craftsmen of the highest order.  And earlier in that scene when one of the scientists yells ""He stole a bagel!"" There were so many cute little flourishes like that in the movie!! There's a bit where Uncle Aaron laughs and his mouth makes those sound lines for a few frames. Peter B. Parker wanting to sacrifice himself also had a dark tinge of suicidal thoughts to it. His life is in shambles, so in his mind, he has less to lose than all of the other Spider-people. It’s weird how adaptations seem to be doing more justice to the character than the comics did for a while. This kind of selflessness (also seen in the PS4 game) is starkly contrast with how comics Peter sold his marriage to the devil because he couldn’t deal with his personal guilt. “We don’t talk about it.” Does this mean the Peter that died is the Toby Maguire Peter from the first 3 films?

Edit: just rewatched it...young og Peter in flashback has blond hair.. Im thinking it's not Toby Maguire's Peter.. But they do use scenes from the OG Trilogy and from the second gen spiderman movies...

Also, there was a male Doc Ock, i think, during OG Spiderman backstory exposition you see his ""tentacles""  Im someone who loves Spiderman 3 and seeing them do that dance scene even with the freaking music I was dying  I lost it at the finger guns lmao Was disappointed that every time someone talked to Kingpin he didn’t monologue for 3 minutes.

 “When I was a boy...” 
 Would be mildly buzzed with this movie. Would die doing this watching Daredevil. I’m glad they played homage to those and also Spider-Man sitting at the desk and the pointing at each other. Even though it was used as a joke in this movie, I wouldn't be surprised if Miguel O'Hara comes back in the sequel for real. His main enemy is Alchemax, and they made a point of showing that the spider that bit Miles came from Alchemax.  I laughed so hard at the meme  I think a big big part of it is that there is so much heart and passion behind this movie as opposed to a lot of Sony's other Spider-Man related moves which were mostly on wringing as much money from his spandex as possible. I was losing it when Miles first ran into alternate Peter, knocked him out, then tried to flee from the cops while still stuck to Peter’s webbing. 

Can’t remember the exact line, but a dispatcher said something like, “There’s a guy dressed like Spider-Man and he appears to be dragging a homeless corpse behind the train”  I saw this in Dolby with the bass rumbling seats. My seat would jump up and down everytime he started walking. It was a great effect.  Finally found someone wider than B E N S W O L O he literally took up 70% of whatever screen he was in. the black hole wasn't under nyc, it was whenever kingpin was around  The Boss Baby's true form. That upside-down skyline shot is going down as iconic. But by the same directors of the Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street.  I felt like it could easily give someone an epileptic seizure. My jaw hung open  I don't know, pretty soon we'll have memers in real positions of power and I'm not sure that's a good thing. I did wonder about the in-universe comics. They seemed to have Peter Parker in them, yet Spidey's identity was secret.  In Ultimate Spider-Man, they addressed that; although he's super famous, he's not able to make money from the merchandise because he's not able to give his real name for them to give him the checks. My uncle Ben died.

*My* uncle Ben died.

**My** uncle Ben died. We didn't find out who Spider ham lost did we? Or have I just forgotten? I felt so along being the only person that chuckled during that.  Though thats probably because there were only 10 people total watching the movie. Who knows what hotdogs are made of in his universe? Maybe undesirable cuts of _human_ meat? Can we also give props to the coolest tv/film portrayal of Aunt May? She’s essentially Peter’s Alfred. Is Otto in that universe? I know nothing of Liv but perhaps she knows her through him? At one point in the comics, Doc Ock was almost married to Aunt May.  Her civilian disguise reminded of Professor Trelawney from Hogwarts.  taking the piss outta of the Raimi films was hilarious! The sequence of everyone across the city hearing that Spider-Man was dead was so well done. The shots of new yorkers looking sadly at their phones hit hard and did an incredible amount of world building for such a short scene. And the music helped a lot too. Now I wonder if it was synced when she was speaking Japanese... In a similar vein, I liked that porkers nostrils were eyes. Even squinting by themselves. Also I thought the robot’s “death” was a play on the anime death scenes.  It's a superhero movie and not Disney

:/ Staying optimistic though! This definitely deserves to win Not Disney/Pixar

The voters don't even fucking know of half the nominees for this category, it's bullshit. I remember a quote from one of them saying how he voted for a Disney/Pixar one because his kid liked it and he doesn't care for ""Chinese things nobody ever freakin' saw"", which was in reference to a Japanese movie.

Edit: Very happy to be wrong btw The Lego Movie wasn’t even nominated. :-/ Legitimately the most visually impressive animated scene I’ve ever seen.  That genuinely made my jaw drop in the best way! In the school I was like what the heck did they just rip Blackalicious's beat or does this just sound really similar... And then they readded the lyrics and I was like ohhh this movie just has a great soundtrack. He was perfect casting for Spider-Ham.

> ""This could literally not get any weirder.""

> ""It **can** get weirder!"" Did not expect the doozy of ""You can't save everyone"" to come from him. Somehow that made it hurt even more lol STREETSMARTS! Looks like they all should have gotten engraved money clips. [deleted] > all the intro sequences for all the Spider-People were a fun way to give backstory for each character

It also let them do that bit where Miles' origin story ends up on the pile too! The best thing about Nick Miller Spider-Man was they struck a nice balance by making him jaded and sort of a slob, yet still supremely skilled at actually being Spider-Man.  Seconded ! I don't know much about spiderman, and I have grown a bit tired over the years of getting the same story told and retold through the various reboots... Even homecoming feels a bit ""meh"" in my opinion (at least not as awesome as people make it out to be, IMHO).

But this one, holy shit they nailed it perfectly. I felt like a fucking child giddly whispering things like, ""Omg that's Green Goblin"" to my girlfriend next to me.  Great explanation and exactly how I felt. 

It stands complete as a film with a wonderful story filled with (surprisingly powerful) emotion and character, but man, you got to appreciate all the little things they put into this movie as a comic book fan. It just goes next level with all that added in.

 A pure love letter to Spider-Man. I’m totally ok with Sony continuing this own universe. Especially considering they teased Oscar Isaac as Miguel!
 [deleted] I wonder how much food Peter B Parker was eating that allowed Spider Man to gain enough wait to get pudgy in the tummy. I imagine his Spidey powers help his metabolism and his constant fighting bad guys would help keep him in shape.  That upside down shot from the trailer of him falling over the city is amazing The shot of him upside down falling was pretty incredible I think the reason it feels so different is that due to the fact that there's usually only one hero per movie, they have to have a suit up sequence fairly early on when we're still learning about the character. Because they had 5 other characters to do the heavy lifting for most of the movie, when Miles finally gets his chance to be the Hero, it feels like he as well as the audience has earned it and it's both an acknowledgement of his arc as his own individual Spider-Man as well as him taking his friends' well-being into his own hands.  That scene had my eyes welling up and then I got immediately hit with the memorial and Mary Jane speaking, seeing all of those people wearing the mask...literally had tears running down my face. 

I think that’s a big part of why I love superheroes so much. They unite diverse groups of people and motivate them to be a little more selfless and push themselves a little harder. The ending of the movie was so perfect, anyone could wear the mask. If anyone got those powers and were faced with a daunting task like that, they have the potential within themselves to conquer fear, get hit and get back up, and make sacrifices to help others. 

Everything in comic book movies is fiction but the attitudes.  ""It always fits"" had me real close to tears. I teared up. His line ""I'm going to miss him too"" felt like a stab.  It have Alchemax letter on it, Alchemax is a Mega corp in Spider man 2099 universe(The blue spidey in after credit screen) The spider had 42 on it

Later on when Miles falls off a building trying to train the numbers 42 lie next to him They pull off half a dozen supervillians while having half dozen spidermen. And it flows all so smoothly it's crazy. Probably because the issue with too many villains isn’t the fact that the villains are present, moreso the inability to write the characters and putting them in anyway.

Spider-Man 3 had 3 villains, but only one was fleshed our (1 was in the previous two movies and then lost most of his interesting characteristics with his memory).  In contrast The Dark Knight us 3 villains but handled them all really well with good balance

The issue isn’t how many but how well they’re written He figures it out in the end! When Miles is thinking about them, he has a solved cube. Was curious about that. Is it that he can't see color or that he can see but his world is black and white so he just never knew what the colors actually are. There was the scene where he was pointing to the colors on the cube and they were telling him that he wasn't making correct guesses to what the colors were. I would watch an entire film of just Nic Cage as SM Noir. If I saw it right, I think he uses a piece of broken plate to arm himself lol This is one of those movies that make me so happy for everybody involved. These projects have so many bits that can fail. Lazy writing, rushed animation, boring soundtrack. But this side-stepped everything and came out *so incredibly perfect*. The Spider-Man of Miles's universe was so damn *cool*, man! It's like he was the only Spider-person to have their shit together and knew what was what. I wish there was more of just seeing him be a badass.  I could not figure out who was voicing the original Spider-Man and a few times I thought it was Jake putting on a voice.  I didn’t know Chris Pine voiced Miles’ Peter Parker until I checked the movie on TV Tropes. That means Marvel has all four Chrises now. I *loved* the billboard shoutout to John Mulaney and Nick Kroll's *Oh, Hello* (*Hi, Hello* in Miles' universe). People care about Spiderman. Who could possibly have enough of an emotional connection to make a meaningful Emoji movie? 

Don't answer that.  Sony Pictures Animation can make fantastic films when they are given something good to work with (see: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). It's the first to not only seem comic bookey, which was the greatest praise XMen Days off Future Past and GotG received, but to also FEEL comic bookey.

The story, the direction, and especially the animation all felt like I was watching an actual comic book come to life. The fact that it had an excellent story and great characters only made the movie better. 

Loved every moment and the movie deserves all the praise it's gotten. What psyches my up so much about this was how well the form met the function. In my opinion, Spiderman on screen is usually represented in a pretty straightforward way. Don't get me wrong, I loved Homecoming, and I'm a RaimiBoi for life. But this was the first time it felt like Spiderman was leaping right out of a comic book. This movie took perfect advantage of the camera, the animation, everything. It couldn't have been a comic, it couldn't have been a live action, it couldn't have been a TV show, it could only be exactly what it was. They had a vision and it felt almost perfectly executed. What a breath of fresh air! One of the best super hero movies.  One of the best animated movies.  Takes both titles.

 I loved when they stealthily took out the guards and Noir really creepily whispered ""*Sleeeeeep*."" God, Noir with the ""can you close off your emotions so you don't get crippled by the moral ambiguity of your violent actions?"" had me cracking up. If you pay attention to Miles’ contact list on his phone, you can see B. Bendis in it (Brian Michael Bendis is the creator of Miles Morales) Part of the style was the intentional low-frame rate of certain aspects of the animation which gave it an incredible great feel to accompany the comic book theme. This one hit me right in the feels...Stan Lee’s cameo right smack in the middle of the city and audience mourning Peter Parker.  For an animated movie, they truly didn’t shy away from the real world emotions of loss and death. I really liked this movie, much more than I thought I would have. Best Spider-Man movie we’ve gotten. With the introduction of Miles Morales in the Spider-Man game, I really hope they explore his character more in the sequel. The game had one of the best depictions of Peter that I’ve ever seen and the limited amounts of Miles were great too  I was so happy they referenced that. I loved old ""washed-up"" Peter Parker.  >Immersion ruined when the usb stick went in on the first try.

Did they not do a joke about ""I can never get this right-"" the first time he tries to pop the goober in? After watching the film, I realized why his uncle took Miles to that hidden spot in the subway tunnel so that he could practice his art. It's because that spot was on the way to the multi-verse machine, the uncle probably walked past the spot on the way to the machine and thought of Miles. I also like that the spider bit him there, all because the uncle took him to that spot. It's not like other films where the bad guy is somehow related to the protagonists by an insane coincidence.

&#x200B; That apartment scene straight up scared me.

Also, this was the first film I saw this year that had the entire theatre (from old to young) pin-drop silent throughout its entirety. Mesmerized. I seem to remember seeing something (albeit outside of the movie) that said he is supposed to be the 616-universe Spider-Man, which would in fact make him the ""main"" one. I know - literally handing over the torch and painting him as the huckster he really was at the same time. A phenomenal sendoff. ""We don't pick the ballroom, we just dance."" Here's hoping for an extended cut on bluray then. All the enemy designs were beautiful. Rectangular kingpin, robot-leg scorpion, plastic tube Doc. Ock. 

Just give these people money and leave them alone, Sony.  As much as I love Peter Parker, it was Prowler that got me. I mean, it was supposed to, but damn if it wasn't a powerful scene. Yeah I wasn't expecting an this much of an emotional ride with the movie. The moment with the original Peter dying really hit me hard too, as well with the moments with Miles and his dad. “Kid, that was adorable” absolutely sold me on Jake Johnson’s Peter. Of COURSE Peter Parker would be the embarrassing uncle figure if he ever took on a protege. This was Rodnney Rothman (Popstar, 22 jump street, forgetting Sarah Marshall) who wrote, directed and produced it. He had Phil Lord as a co writer and producer, but Miller had no involvemet in this movie at all. ""I'm gonna miss him...""

WE'RE GOING TO MISS *YOU* STAN STOP TALKING ABOUT SPIDERMAN FOR 2 SECONDS Double gut punch during the death of Spider-Man too. 😭😭😭😭 It amuses me greatly that Donald played Aaron Davis in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Brian Tyree Henry has now played Jefferson Davis. Fun fact: The Community scene on Aaron's TV was directed by the Russo Brothers. And Donald's 2010 bid for the role of Peter Parker was the inspiration for Miles' creation.  Apparently, that's the scene that inspired Brian Michael Bendis to make a black Spider-Man. Prowler's theme was absolutely beautiful. So much menace behind such a tragic character. Also Donald played Aaron in Homecoming. Yeah, there are so many little things like that. Gotta rewatch it.  ""Hey."" Miles’ best superpower is that he’s coachable.  His uncle said ""you have the best of all of us"" Infinity War, this, and what else? I played Spider-Man on PS4 in nightmare difficulty and watched Spider-Man die hundreds of times. Miles: [The Prowler is my uncle](#spoiler)

Noir-Spider: Damn thats a great backstory

😂😂😂 I think it was his only line that wasn't comedy, but it was very well done The fact that even Spider-Ham gave sincere, sad advice in that “My [uncle/friend/father] was killed” scene shows that the movie had a lot of heart. They could have just as easily had him say his uncle was killed by a falling anvil as a joke, which would have deflated the scene. Doc Ock wouldn’t be caught dead running something so inefficient  Not that I can recall. There is a female Doc Ock. I think she's Octavia rather than olivia. She looks basically like a gender swapped otto: short, overweight, bowl cut, metal arms. She's a good guy though and I like her.  She was giving me a strong Madame Web vibe when Miles went back to get his final suit. >great part of the character we see in the comics and we never see onscreen.

The Raimi movies dealt a lot with Peter being bad at Peter As a fan of animated films it saddens me people are surprised when they’re well written and well made. I wish more people have them a chance and didn’t write them off as “kids movies” or “cartoons” >He was good at being Spiderman but bad at being Peter - great part of the character we see in the comics and we never see onscreen.

You're so right.  I didn't realize how true this is.  Hopefully Kevin Feige will see your comment and implement that in the Spider film after Far From Home. ""i'm so proud of you Miles!  Wait...  does this mean i want kids?""

Fuckin lol 😂😂 I love how they all pretend to leave but are then just hiding around the window listening in.  If Miles succeeded and used his abilities on command they would have probably reappeared to congratulate him. I don't understand this yet. But I will.  ""Is this blue?""

""No.""

""Okay, what about this one?"" He probably 'invented' the rubiks cube in his universe  I like to light matches and let them burn to my fingers just so I can feel something.

\*Match goes out before reaching fingers\* YES. I thought the same and it was super unsettling  ROOOOWWWAAAAAHHHHHHHHEEEEEEELLLLPPPPPPMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I was waiting for it and totally missed it! Was it during the end credits sequence? I saw the spidey-desk one... yup they literally referenced the ""And I'm just sitting here masturbating"" meme in this movie. amazing. I thought the same thing after I watched it, and even checked his IMDb page to see if he voiced Timon.  I think he just sounds like that

Sort of like how he's taller than average but his self-deprecation makes me view him as small, and kind of in the same way he seems sneakily classically attractive (like a 50s movie star *almost*,) but his demeanor and comedy shroud this ""Sometimes I burn a match down to my fingers to feel something- ANYTHING!"" ""That's a hardcore origin story"" ""I don't understand this cube... but I will."" I really hope they don’t get involved. I thought it was pretty refreshing in this movie that they didn’t kiss at the end. I subscribe to Miyazaki’s notion that just because there’s a male and female protagonist in a movie doesn’t mean they have to end up together.  And a spin-off movie with Gwen and a few other Spider-Women:
https://screenrant.com/spiderman-spiderverse-spinoff-spider-woman-silk/ I loved that they did her hair up in a beehive that made her head the same shape as an octupus There's a quick line before they head into Alchemex when Peter assumes the head scientist is a man and needs to take a second to check his internal bias. Yeah i was caught somewhat off guard by that, i sorta just expected her to be the scientist mook who existed for 2 scenes. I also loved her suit design, doing something outside of the metal arms and going more with a sorta organic rubber for the tentacles and across the body to give it the feeling of Octopus skin almost. I thought I heard her say her name was ""Octavius"" during the part where Miles comes in late to his class, but it was so faint I decided to ignore it AND I heard her say ""Fisk industries"" or something and my fiancee and I got distracted by that lol. Such an amazing reveal. In a movie with such phenomenal and fleshed-out characters I'm glad they actually took the time to make the main villain sypmathetic. Outside of the minor villains like scorpion and goblin who are there just to kill spiderman or whatever, every character gets their moments where they develop and show nuance.

Miles' dad talking to Miles through the door made me well up with tears, and I felt the mix of heartbreak and the fear that Miles felt when its revealed that Prowler is his uncle.

Most of all though I gotta give props to Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker. He was incredible. He nailed every comedic scene along with every emotional one. The writing really helped, but his performance was top-notch. He was kind of based on the [second Ultimate Scorpion ](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Maximus_Gargan_(Earth-1610)) in my opinion. He was a bit of a mix.  I just love the fact that he's randomly there. “The good news is...we don’t have to steal the monitor.”  So good. Yes that was hilarious too. Noticing the bagel and not the PC...lmao I love that they went there. I'm a sucker for darker super heroes, and I did not expect any of that here. 

Noir Spidermans ""I let matches run down really close so that I can feel something, anything"" was also great.  Speaking of, did you see the PS4 suit on the left in his Spider-Cave? Reminded me of Green Lantern in Teen Titans Go! To the Movies. He says the same thing I don't think it's supposed to be taken that seriously, it's just a meta joke. Heavily inspired by that Peter It's just callbacks my dude. On PS4's Spider-Man he tries to stop a train with webs, Tobey style, and the web breaks and he says ""Oh man that totally worked last time!"" and he is in no way shape or form Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man.

They just use the multiverse excuse to have these little callbacks that make us feel good inside - and I, for one, appreciate it! ""This city"" If they bothered to get Oscar Isaac for the role I'm sure he'll be back.  I'm absolutely certain he comes back. The watch he was developing is how all the Spider-people are able to move through dimensions in the comics.  I mean, I feel that after credits scene was an obvious lead up to part 2. Miguel is going to unite the Spider Totems. The 60s cartoon was just a fun gag.  **""YOU'RE POINTING AT ME!""** They had that meme and Spider-Man at the computer.   This reminded me of how good the animated DC movies are. Like, this was top-tier Marvel. Which just means that, if this movie is as successful as it deserves, I fear that Sony is going to immediately shit the bed trying to wring every scent out of the Spider-Verse that they can manage. I really, really hope I'm wrong there, but the recent Spider-Man-less Venom movie does not inspire confidence. You pretty much nailed the line. That scene was on Venom's post credits and I loved that they changed it just enough that it still felt fresh and it amazing to watch IIRC, the in-universe comic Spider-Man had brown hair and I think was called “Billy”. There’s a blink and you’ll miss it moment where Miles is reading one of these comic books and a speech bubble says “You can do this Billy!” IIRC. Right, and in that same Ultimate universe, Kingpin gets back at Spider-Man by purchasing his likeness rights, so every piece of Spidey merchandise put money in the pockets of Wilson Fisk.  My uncle Benjamin died For me it was my uncle Benjamin.  the most tragic aspect about his origin is that he lost his life as a spider after being bitten by a radioactive pig, who was a pig Aunt May ([I shit you not](https://imgur.com/a/yNk3gAM)).   Lol there was that part during the credits where pigs in his dimension were roasting a human Spider-Man on a spit I loved it. I was expecting the standard old/frail/sad aunt may, but damn she didn’t take anyone’s shit. I was half hoping to see her suit up and spank kingpin down the street  It’s Ultimate May. Of course she’s a boss.  Remember when Dr. Ock almost married Aunt May? I assume that's still canon. Which for sure makes Superior Spider-Man even weirder.  I know it’s the Disney award, but I’ll be legitimately disappointed if it doesn’t get Best Animated Feature. This movie is one of the best examples of making use of the medium. As another commenter said, the movie couldn’t quite work as well if it were a live action movie or a TV show. 
Disney and Pixar set a great standard for beautiful looking animation, but this movie used the fact that it’s animated to its advantage! In the animated medium, anything is possible, and they did that here. >	""Chinese things nobody ever freakin' saw"", which was in reference to a Japanese movie

It was in reference to *The Tale of Princess Kaguya* and *Song of the Sea*, Japanese and Irish respectively. Both utterly fantastic films, too. Also, don't forget his law-breaking last line, >!That's all, folks!< Ohhh I hear it now Letting him take a serious beat was such a brilliant decision. You want it? Go get it! That was misleading from the trailer. I didn't expect the black section being Kingpin the absolute units  Yes! That was so cool, I loved how they brought it full circle that way ""And for 2 days, I've been the one and only Spider-Man!"" “holy shit it’s fucking doc ock” My time has come Depression can be hell. The guy was suicidal, hence why he was so willing to volunteer to stay behind. I'd imagine that after the separation he stopped webslinging and just sat around eating. [deleted] Also the music was hype as fuck  The music was also hype as fuck. It reminded me of ~~Killgrave~~Killmonger's throne-room entrance with how damn cool it was.  In my theater we always cheerfully hoot during Stan Lee's cameos. This time it was a heartfelt ""woooooaaaah"". ""It always fits"" had me chuckling given the immediate visual gag of the big in-store sign that said ""NO Returns or Refunds!"" Then it panned to the sign saying no returns or exchanges lol  Alchemax did exist in Miles' universe too tho. Maybe since they existed in both, it stayed in the same facility when it dimension hopped.  They also showed 42 on a lotto ball, and mentioned that Miles has won a lottery to get into the prep school.  Credits also had him put the solved cube up in a display and had wave of tourists and photographers starring at it.  It seemed like he could actually perceive the colors and the differences between them but had trouble remembering the names of the actual colors. He went from black and white to being bombarded with an entire color wheel. Besides Spider-Gwen? If i'm correct it was originally meant to be John Krasinksi (he was in the first trailer) but I guess they replaced him at some point in post production. I hadn't heard anything about Pine being in this and at the start of the movie by girlfriend tapped me on the shoulder and was like ""is that Chris Pine?"" And I was like ""No, they said Peter is that guy from New Girl. I think he's just doing a heroic voice thing"". She insisted it was Chris Pine though and whipped out her phone the second the credits rolled. I was pleasantly surprised but also now I lowkey want Chris Pine to voice Spider-Man in something for real Evans, Hemsworth, Pine, Pratt

Long ago, the four Chrises lived in harmony >Sony Pictures Animation can make fantastic films when they have Phil Lord/Chris Miller

FIFY

They really need to get those guys locked down, Meatballs was fun and Spiderverse was EXCELLENT And for the first time, the villains aren't grounded in gritty realism to make them believable to the general audience :o One of the best movies. Give it the Oscar. So many tiny moment like that sprinkled throughout.

When they were jumping down the elevator shaft, Peni makes an anime jump noise, Noir makes a silent *whoooosh* noise, and Ham makes a Looney Tunes *sproing* noise. ""We don't choose the ballroom, we just dance."" I liked near the end when peter says to miles ""I'm so proud of you!! Do I want kids??"". That had me dying! ""Where I go, the wind follows. And the wind smells like rain."" His dad's phone had Steve Ditko listed too. Sara Pichelli is just a few below his dad - she was the artist who co-created Miles. I thought it was great when aunt mae looks at him with a bit of disgust haha like you let yourself go peter.  ""pop the goober in"" soulds absolutely disgusting ""I was down here for an engineering job."" They already said 12-15 minutes of fully finished animation will be on an extended blu-ray  Jake Johnson was fantastic in this movie ""We're all going to miss you too Stan."" Now to complete the Atlanta trinity, we just need Lakeith Stanfield to play Rio Morales. They also used that rumbly theme for the misdirect with Peter & Miles at the cemetery. There was so much clever usage of the soundtrack cut between scenes and used alongside the animation's motion. Like how when Miles stands in front of the screen in class, his body obscures Olivia's last name You're not doing it right.

**Hey.** Gwen's flashback perhaps? (If that wasn't it, I would also like to know) All the times you die in Spider-Man PS4 Just came back from watching it he says  that's a hardcore origin story [deleted] What I liked about this movie is it has the Smash Bros. effect; it could easily be gratuitous crossover junk food that treats its references lightly, but instead it had this validation of the other iterations of Spider-Man. Like that Spider Ham was allowed to not only to interject his weird origin in but also allowed to kick ass on top of being a looney tune character was the best because if that’s your favorite iteration of Spider-Man, he was treated with respect. He could’ve easily just been played for laughs but they let him be his own character and that added a ton to the movie. Spider-Ham doesn't technically have any known real family in-universe. He was a spider turned into a pig when he was bit by scientist May Porker when she temporarily went crazy after irradiating herself trying to create the world's first atomic hair dryer. She then came to believe he was her nephew Dock Ock has telepathic mechanical arms and uses them to rob banks instead of selling them to the military. Inefficient is on the Octavius coat of arms. I was honestly half expecting her to be that dimensions Madame Web and be involved in the dimensional fuckery simply because she was so plugged in Let’s be fair, he wasn’t the best at being Spider-Man either. Homeboy lost his mask every half second That's my point exactly - due to the cost and effort of producing one, animated productions are scripted to within an inch of their life. I'm not saying they can't be amazing - see Ghibli, Disney, et al - but to take such a risky and experimental approach to humour and plot is fantastic. While I really enjoyed it in this film I don’t really think it would work in Far From Home. It made sense for this Spider-man because of how long he has been doing the job and where he’s at in his life. He knows everything about being Spider-man because he’s been doing it for around 20 years but because of his personal struggles like his failed marriage and his financial problems he’s lost the optimism and hope that makes Peter Parker who he is. I don’t think Tom Holland’s Spider-man has reached that point yet as he still just a high school kid.  Yeah, best end credit scene besides Deadpool 2 imo Wait what was the desk scene? I saw the pointing scene but don’t remember the desk for some reason How... how old do you think John Mulaney is??? And then the match goes out before it reaches his fingers and he’s all disappointed.  I often wonder if this was part of the script or it was Nick Cage being Nick Cage ""I don't understand this thing, but I'm taking it with me."" That line kind of encapsulated the movie for me. It was at the same time funny, heartfelt, self-aware, and earnest. I'm taking it with me He solved it though... Smart man.  They don't *have* to end up together, and in some cases it's not a good fit.

But I don't know, in this case I still **want** them to get involved and I can't exactly say why. I don’t disagree with you but this is Sony, subtlety in relationships is practically forbidden. Didn't even pick up on that until now. Good catch. She was one of the most badass parts of the movie I think there's even more to it, the guy he's sneaking up on is a diligent looking Asian man in square glasses, but the head scientist ends up being the frizzy haired, almost hippy-looking woman with big round glasses. Seemed like they were trying to flip the Dr. Wu archetype super-scientist on it's head, successfully imo, one of the very few villian turns I haven't seen coming recently. Yeah, the promotional material made her seem like she'd be the Alfred-type character, I love that it ended being Aunt May instead. Another actually well done trailer misdirect. When Jefferson Davis is talking to Miles through the door. Man. He doesnt even say whats happened. just “something’s happened”. You can feel Jeff’s pain about the distance he let grow between him and Aaron and that he’s scared he’s having the same thing happen with Miles. Especially cause the previous scene of Jeff is him leaving aaron a message saying “you know I wouldnt be calling if it wasnt important.”  For me the uncle scene. Miles' reveal just completely unraveled his existence because he likes that little dude so much, I was in tears. That movie fucked me up quite a bit, there was some really emotional stuff packed in there. I was scared Miles’ dad was gonna die too after that scene and it was gonna be the last opportunity they had to speak to each other. That would’ve really fucked with me.  Prolly was in the original cartoon episode but most of us have only ever seen the meme I lost it when he did that. Funniest part of the movie for me I laughed even harder when Doc Ock yelled “it’s proprietary!” Yea I'm not sure why even but that part and the snowman head had me almost doubled over laughing. They were both just so wonderfully absurd. 

 i literally told my friend before that, why does he steal the monitor, he doesnt need that.

then peter comes around and says that exact thing, had a good laugh at that Also just the absurdity of all these employees being locked and loaded in the cafeteria.  I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS, we don't need the monitor I immediately though of the game with that gallery of suits. Such a subtle, but great shout-out. Also starring Nick Cage as a meme But alot of the exposition during that scene was straight out of the original movies.. Idk.. In my headcanon it is the Toby Maguire Peter Reading all these in D'onforio's voice. ~~Which one do I shoot~~?

Edit: Just re-watched. The cop said ""Which one pointed first?""  During the credits scene! I was laughing like a moron at such references. The people in my theatre didn't get those at all. How good they were. The quality of the recent DCAU movies doesn't hold a candle to the earlier ones. I felt so bad for Peter Parker's face. Slammed into a tombstone, brick wall, moving train, cars, the asphalt. Imagine all the skin being scrapped off. Good thing they are durable and heal quick  Good catch! And smart of the production team to think of it. Nic Cage was the best casting choice of the year for this character. Every single one of his lines had me rolling.  This is the weirdest fucking timeline It passes by quickly but I love that they kept that as the origin in the movie.  You quickly hear him say that he was bitten by a pig. Yo when she kicked Tombstone through the front door haha that was amazing to see My sheltered children have only known Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, so I had to explain. But also, humongous props that this movie that was so relentlessly edgy and energetic and was also the most thoroughly PG comic book movie I've ever seen. My kids were enthralled and didn't hear a single curse or sexual innuendo. I loved it when she knocked Scorpion with the bat outside. She was not having any super villain shit that day  Exactly what I was thinking. Do you remember Doc Ock's full name in the movie? I can't find anything online. I think Sony wanted to keep it a secret this Ock would be a lady.  Are you legally allowed to say that?  Beat it bozo! i loved his pure new york accent.

usually his mannerisms are more ''refined''

but you could tell he grew into the city. My friends were probably wondering why I was so tense in every scene with the Prowler lmao.  I was the only one in my group who knew his identity. My favorite shot is him showboating at the end of the movie when he jumps onto the wall and the camera follows him and turns perspective with him.  That makes the joke even more funny because knowing the names of the colors is not needed to solve the cube.  Well she seemed somewhat traumatized be her Peter's death and was unwilling to open up to people until the end of the movie I mean comic book Spider-Gwen being a hot mess is kinda one of her signature traits in her intro run. It seems like Ghost-Spider Spider-Gwen is gonna have her shit together a bit more now, but idk if we can for certain say she's all there in this. > whipped out her phone the second the credits rolled.

Lol. Whipped out her phone during the credits...to check the credits. I'm still really upset they got kicked from Solo....

It could have been an amazing movie instead of the slightly  above-average one that we all predicted would happen once they got the boot.  A superhero movie that gets the fact that villains are believable when their motivations are clear and grounded.  I liked how Kingpin was just damned enormous. I really hope this gets serious Oscar buzz... This was such a good movie all around, I feel like it appealed to every demographic (except those that get dizzy easily)..

The superhero nerds will love it, and people who love good movies will love it.

It's crazy good  A silent noise, eh? ""That's a pretty hardcore origin story."" They gave Miles, Peter and Gwen awesome arcs. The other characters didn't get as much screentime, but were still amazing. Probably that ""You can't save everyone, just focus on saving one person"" bit.  ***Hey.*** It was gwen's flashback. [deleted] ""But i don't want to cure cancer, i want to turn people into dinosaurs!""
Villain logic In Miles' universe, Peter Parker/Spiderman is the maybe the best version out of all multiverses it stands to reason that we get the best/most badass version of aunt May too.  Apparently they *relentlessly* polished this one after the fact.

That’s not to say “scripted to an inch of its life,” kind of the opposite. Word on the street is that if a scene wasn’t perfect, they’d redo it. Probably Phil Lord’s doing, the comedic timing was great. Homecoming end credits with Cap was fantastic too  *Whoa, that tall child looks terrible!* They had good chemistry. > I can't exactly say why.

I can, it's because they're cute nerds and I'm hopelessly sappy Everything regarding the computer was the best hacking I ever saw. I didn't even catch the Sony self-deprecating meta-joke in that until this very moment. Well done, Sony. well, they were all kingpin employed. Maybe. Or at least prepared to be anti-Spider-Man. It was refreshing to see someone be prepared lol. Ten seconds before that line my wife was like, ""Why is he taking the monitor?"" But they had that hanging cars from the bridge scene that was in Amazing Spider-Man too True but this peter uses web shooters, maguire's comes out of his wrists Tobey Maguire was originally considered to voice Peter in the film too! Obviously Spider-man pointed first!! No when Miles and Peter steal the computer, Peter is also in behind the computer format  Kinda-technically *his own* tombstone, as well.

Speaking of, did they ever address Tombstone by name? I was wracking my brain the whole movie to figure out who that grey dude was, I’ve yet to see him in any of the comics I own so I’m used to the SP4 Spidey version of Tombstone. Well if basic viewers can pick that out I'm sure they thought of all internet conspiracy theories that may pop up with this movie I was so hyped for Mulaneys character and cautiously optimistic about Cages , but he completely knocked it out if the park. ""I burn a match all the way down just to feel something"" bahaha I was discussing this with my husband. I like the casting they had in the recent show because the character was so serious. I loved Cage in the role in the movie because he was able to be funny without overdoing it. Just perfect.  Watch the most recent animated series. Spider-Ham is like super successful in his universe, too.  I said, take this outside! /wack Sony: ""Bet you punks want an Aunt May movie now, huh?"" Pretty sure she smacked him with a bat through it haha Olivia Octavius was her name.  They really just hired Schrieber to do peak Ray Donovan  I had figured that he was probably the Prowler when we first heard his voicemail message. Him showing up in the apartment only confirmed that.

But damn, he looked badass with his mask off. Yeah, she's a bit stand-offish vs. Genuine and kind like og spidey. if it doesn't win best animated it was robbed A silent *whoosh* noise.  Everyone's heard that before. I love the terms “biscuit boxer” and “turtle slapper”. No no no,

**Hey** Yeah, I noticed that as well. That was the most realistic hacking I've ever seen in a superhero movie. No BS ""hacking the mainframe"", absurdly guessable passwords, or even a hand wavy ""virus on a USB stick"". Just good, old fashioned shoulder surfing. Prepared with the weapons but with stormtrooper aim I think its more like similar things happen in all these universes. iirc Spider-man is not upside down in the kiss scene and he's wearing his costume in two scenes where he should've been peter parker. Divorced Spider-man also does the upside down kiss as well.  Honestly, that would've been amazing. Yeah, this really underscored just how little I was impressed by Incredibles 2. Spider-Verse is such a fresh take on the genre, in every element. Meanwhile I2 was just... more Incredibles.

I'm skeptical the Academy will get it right, but I hope Sony makes the push to get the film in front of their eyes. I love the story the directors told about how they had Nick Cage just run through a long ass list of 30's slang they found online because it was funny to watch, animated a bunch of it, and only down the line did it occur to them to actually double check the phrases, only to find a lot of them weren't 30's slang but actually modern sex positions, forcing them to scrap the animation.

Always double check you work, kiddos.

Edit: Story [here](https://youtu.be/IOgiyGiVRBw?t=1805) for reference. Whole interview is great. ^*Hey* That and the insanely cluttered desktop sold that scene for me. Lord and Miller said that having MJ upside down in the kiss as well as other small tweaks were supposed to indicate that he was a combination of all the most popular Peters. Heeeyyyyyyyyy ",0
127,"Theres a thread that pops up here every once in a while about what people think is the best acting in one scene in a movie. Sally Hawkins in the scene where she's begging Giles for his help to rescue the Asset. Where she's telling him to say what she signs. God damn so good.  I want a del toro bioshock movie so bad that it hurts  [deleted] I seriously didn't think I would like Giles that much. I adore the close relationship he has with Elisa, and I really want to know how they first met. Man, did I cringe (in a good way) during that scene when he was talking to the pie guy. I felt *so* bad for him. 

I admit that I did like the little scene where Elisa basically tells Zelda that she had sex with the fish man because they could have easily gone to "" Oh god you had sex with him?! Eww! I can't look at you anymore"" angle. Instead, they basically had Zelda react as if  it wasn't *that* big of a deal, save for the whole "" Does he have a dick?"" part. Plus Zelda basically laughs like ""Wow Elisa I can't believe you had sex with him! You just went for it, huh? "". Weird for me to put into words, but it was nice that Zelda wasn't grossed out at Elisa? It just felt like a casual conversation between good friends.

I think one of my favorite scenes was at the end where Asset revives and stares down Strickland before killing him. Not because of Strickland getting killed, but because the Asset really looked ""like a god"", and it really felt like a ""You kidnapped me, tortured me, tried to kill me, and you killed *her*. How dare you."" vibe with his body language. Also props for the movie not making the Asset come back to life like it was a huge dramatic moment. IIRC, there was no music playing, and it was a nice touch to me. 

Not gonna lie, I stared at Strickland's hand each time it was on screen, and I did like how the fingers slowly changed colors over time due to it rotting. That said, I am kinda surprised that it didn't seem to affect his health with how black those fingers were near the end. I could have missed something, though. There were two I really loved about this film.

1. That poem at the end. So gorgeous.

2. There’s a moment that would usually be your typical passionate Oscar award speech when Elisa is telling Giles how desperate she is to save Fish Man, but that passion is only seen physically in her body, and on her face, due to Giles simply translating her movements sans passion. That was so intriguing to me. You were speaking Russian BOB! Oh my god that was incredible.

So what do y'all think? Was she a fish person originally, or did he just give her gills? “Can I offer you a nice egg in this trying time?” WHY DID HE HAVE TO EAT THAT POOR KITTY SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TELL THAT BITCH YOLANDA TO BE COOL I could listen to Octavia Spencer rant about Bruce all day. Fuckin Bruce.

Also I love this movie  I loved the scene where the monster escaped from the apartment and Elisa finds him alone in the cinema.   He was transfixed on the film playing,  which I believe was The Ten Commandments as there were slaves working on what appeared to be Egyptian monuments.  It struck me pretty powerfully because Elisa is this monster's Moses, breaking his chains,  hiding him from villainy,  and ultimately just trying to free him.   Wow.

Cold era fairy tale. The music was incredible and I loved the main theme over the opening water sequence. Loved the ASL. Loved the whole movie musical moment. Also, props to that door manufacturer for making such a water tight seal.  I'm really glad that Del Toro didn't go down the path where Elisa's voice gets magically cured- her character was just so perfect and although I was delighted by the solo song and dance sequence, I was worried that he'd undermine his own message by ""fixing"" her. And then I remembered it's Del Toro and I was just glad he gave us at least not horribly depressing ending! ""Sometimes I think I was born too early or too late for my life"" is one of the best lines of the film. Born too late to be an artist, too early to be accepted as gay. The editing on this movie was SO VELVETY SMOOTH. It was like butter. 

Sally Hawkins, have your Oscar nomination now (though I'm worried Meryl Streep is going to play spoiler to Sally & Frances McDormand's competition).

The Strickland peeing scene is maybe my favorite scene of the entire movie. Best laugh I had all year.

I really wanted to see the fishman's penis tho. *Disappointed* I'd like to talk about the ending. I personally believe that the ending may not be the ""true"" events (I am aware that this is a work of fiction) but are just Giles' mind fantasizing that they ""lived happily ever after"". This of course is a trick del Toro pulled in Pan's Labyrinth when [Ofelia sees her parents and the faun welcoming her back into the fantasy land but with the implication being that this may be just her seeing what she wants to see in her dying moments.](#spoiler)

I also found it interesting how just about everyone character in the movie has difficulty communicating with someone they're close to (Zelda can't emotionally connect with her husband, Giles can't communicate with the Pie guy, Strickland outright refuses to communicate with his wife), but Elisa and Sexually Thrilling Undersea Dude (S.T.U.D.) are able to communicate better than anyone else despite both lacking the ability to speak. I just thought that was interesting. Giles is just such a delightful character: erudite, slightly crass, so genuine. I loved his excitement at concocting a plan with Elisa, felt such heartbreak for him with his failures in his love life, and such joy when he got his hair back. He was really the perfect supporting player. 

Great film, loved it even though I had a few issues with the third act (it seems weird that Hoffstetler would give Elisa and Zelda up if he knew he was going to die no matter what), and some of the writing was a bit on the nose. Did anyone notice she lived above the Orpheum movie theater? A callback to the poet from Greek mythology, Orpheus, as well as the fact that she was an orphan. I really appreciated the name
E Probably goes without saying but...Michael Shannon is so so good in this. The bit at Zelda's house where he rips off his infected fingers is something that will stick with me for a while. I don’t care what anyone says, Abraham Sapien is definitely Elisa and fishman’s child.  Loved the movie. Doug Jones was wonderful as sexy fish man My absolute favorite thing about this movie was just how freaking gorgeous the color palette was. Specifically a lot of emphasis being placed on the color green, so I just wanted to ask you guys; what did you think the color green actually meant in the context of the movie? In addition to being probably the most prominent color, there are even a few lines about it directly in the movie. So what did you guys think about that? my girlfriend pointed out that toilet water would have merged with the water they were swimming in in that bathroom scene

 The movie made a woman and fish man fucking cool, so it gets a thumbs up from me.  Did anyone notice that Michael Shannon's family were identical to the family Giles paints for the ad... right down to the green jelly [deleted] Not my personal favorite of 2017, but in my opinion, this is the most perfect movie I've seen this year. I was entranced the entire time. It really feels like Guillermo del Toro's love letter to creature features, classic Hollywood romance, and cinema in general. The world he built was incredibly immersive and surreal, and literally every single performance was immaculate. I've seen and loved both Lady Bird and Three Billboards, but Hawkins deserves the Oscar. Stuhlbarg's triple-layered character is incredibly well-acted. He's a potentially sinister scientist--no wait, he's actually a Soviet spy--no wait, he's actually a decent person with a heart of gold. And he shuffled back and forth between these layers with complete ease. Richard Jenkins and Octavia Spencer play the greatest friends you could ever ask for, and Shannon is the perfect villain. And every single character gets a fleshed out backstory. I was amazed at how much story was told in just 2 hours. Not a single wasted scene. Okay, I feel like I'm ranting at this point. I need to see this movie again.

Oh and the creature itself. It was really incredible to look at. Doug Jones killed it too. When she turned her bathroom into an aquarium all I could think was: You inconsiderate bitch, don't you know your gonna flood the whole place? That scene where Elisa starts singing ""You'll Never Know"" and it transitions to them dancing in Black and White on a stage was so surprising and it's one of my favorite scenes in any film this year. Also when Elisa was convincing Giles to help her get The Creature out...goddamn if that doesn't win Sally Hawkins all the awards I loved that the escape from the facility happened during the middle of the movie instead of being part of the climax. We get more time with the characters to see their relationship grow, and the more realistic (and they did a fantastic job of making it feel real) love story can set in.  I think this goes without saying but it's a film for those who don't typically have a voice. A black women in the 50s, a closeted gay man , a Latin women who doesn't have the ability to speak and scientist . 

Those have the ability to speak are the ones who cannot communicate the best. The two characters that cannot talk communicate the best . 

It does all that and is a total genre bender that doesn't conform . I do think my favorite films don't have a specific genre but rather dip their toes into many in a great manner .

Shape of Water is something special that I am yet to even fully appreciate. Del Toro shows us his honest self as a filmmaker and it's beautiful. You just want to give that guy a hug .  Something I noticed is the posters in the women's locker room had foreshadowing. One said ""Don't waste Baltimore water (filling up the bathroom) many times over) and"" Loose Lips Sink Ships"" (Hoffstetler getting shot in the cheek and ratting them out.)  Just call me Kanye West cuz now I want that fish stick  The film was beyond amazing, it has left me with a very lonely feeling ever since I left the theater last night, but in a bittersweet way. The music is nothing short of a masterpiece, I was actually reading that Desplat approached the score as “a musical for those without voices”. The music gives it an added layer that makes this movie an instant classic. Richard Jenkins stole the show for me, he was one of the saddest characters I’ve seen but also one of the most likable, I was extremely happy he was basically the third main character. His rejection at the diner followed by his speech he gives to Elisa while crying was crushing. Sally Hawkins has everyone in love with her for good reason, she’s fantastic and charming. My favorite visual was the Asset standing in the theater. Also Michael Stuhlbarg gives a story worthy of a stand-alone movie. When he says “Please, call me Dimitri” to the group, it spoke volumes, being comfortable enough to give away your biggest secret to strangers. Michael Shannon was menacing as fuck and I loved how he brought the god aspect to The Asset, his final line “so you really are God” was crazy, like that simple line has so much impact on the whole movie. And finally I think this is deserving of any oscar it’s nominated for. It’s perfect

also the way the music is timed at the very end was satisfying as hell, when the screen and music are fading out, and then the music swells exactly as the title comes up. I’m leaving out a lot of stuff, like I could talk about every single scene it’s just that good. Michael Shannon’s gangrene fingers were fucking disgusting though. I could’ve done without seeing him sniff them, then squeeze an ocean of pus out of them. And damn Elisa does some hardcore masturbating starting with the opening scene  He fucking ate the kitties head. Guys. That's an automatic strike 3 in my relationships.  [deleted] Half my theater started laughing and cheering when Strickland’s car got smashed. Anyone else get a big theater reaction to that scene? Can anyone tell me the candy Michael Shannon eats throughout??  ""You *are* a god."" Probably my favorite ""last words"" of all time. This movie made me fall in love with Sally Hawkins.  I loved this movie!  It had a wonderful sense of surrealism like *Amelie*, or *Big Fish*, or *La La Land*.  I will admit, when Giles ended his story and recited the poem, I just started ugly crying.  There was so much emotion that came over me that I just let it all out.  There are plenty of morons here who keep commenting ""LOL FUCKED A FISH"" who are probably 14 and can't grasp the concept of subtext in a film. Shame those comments are getting upvoted because they weren't funny the first time and still aren't 20 times after either.

Regardless, fantastic film. One of my favorites of the last few years. Yolanda really needed to be cool.  Richard Jenkins is an absolute treasure.  Wow I really loved this film. It really felt like a sister movie to Pan's Labyrinth, and a return to form for Del Toro. Sally Hawkins was able to convey so much emotion and thought with just her face. I thought this was VERY well done. There was a lot that I truly loved in this film, but I had really hard time actually buying the romance. The Fishman really didn't come off as being intelligent on the same level as a human. We don't see it hold a conversation with Elisa, demonstrate any great emotional understanding, etc. It really felt like Elisa was just taking advantage of an animal. Maybe that was intended to be ""ambiguous"" but it didn't feel like the movie acknowledged the ambiguity in any way. Saw it at TIFF and the crowd went wild when Elisa and the creature were at the movie theatre because that’s the theatre that we were watching the movie in. 

I wasn’t a fan of Crimson Peak and I thought Pacific Rim was fine, but Shape of Water was Del Toro at his best and his creativity, and wonderful story-telling ability shine through in this movie.  I really, really liked this movie and it might be my favorite Del Toro movie.

BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT

I will always be required to simplify it to my general audience friends as ""I just saw that movie where the lady fucked the fish man.  It's really good, go see it."" I love how blatantly sexual this film is. First five minutes and Elisa is masturbating in the tub. Really set the stage for the kind of film Guillermo wanted to make and you are either on board or not.

To me the whole theme of this movie is taking sexuality versus sharing it; self versus selfless. Strickland just takes sexuality, his ideal woman is Elisa because she can’t talk while his dick is inside her, basically the ultimate form of selfish sexuality. Meanwhile Fishman at very least respects Elisa for herself, and cares for her on an emotional level.

I think this also relates to the way green pops up over and over, notably in comparison between Strickland’s lime candies and Giles’ fridge full of key lime pie. As Strickland notes he consumes the candies based on his own needs while Jenkins selflessly eats the pies despite them being apparently garbage because he’s seeking a bigger connection with the pie shop owner.

 I love that Michael Shannon represents old America. Everyone talks about making America great again, but this Shannon’s character is what that America entails. Did anyone else think the juxtaposition of the sex scenes was interesting thematically? We see Strickland have sex with his wife and it's very aggressive and he completely ignores her during it. However, the way the Eliza/asset scenes are shot it's more ""artsy"" and less concerned with the actual sex aspect of it. [deleted] Of all the questions I never thought I'd ask when watching a prestige Oscar movie, ""How will the mute girl shower-fuck the river monster when he has no visible dick?"" is right at the top of the list. 

Guiermo for best director though. Seriously, if you don't cry when Elisa and the creature have a 1940s musical you are basically dead inside. It was so heartbreaking when she slowly went back to reality at the end of the number. Just saw the movie and it was really good!  The only other Del Toro movie I'm familiar with is Pacific Rim.  I always liked that movie due to how anime it felt and this movie also I believe has some anime inspiration that I'll get into later in this write up.

First and foremost, Sally Hawkins did a fantastic job as Elisa.  Her scene where she was pleading with Giles to save the fishman was so incredibly powerful and she did not speak a word during it.  This years lead actresses is stacked, I still haven't watched I tonya yet but between Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird and Francis McDormand in Three billboards I believe Sally Hawkins had the superior performance.  Every actor and actress did a great job here, I can see Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins getting some award nods too.

If there was an award for best color design this movie would win it.  The pallet was consistent through out and knew when to include oranges for tense moments and reds for a variety of reasons such as the red Elisa wore that grew through out the film to describe the growing love between her and the fishman (she had a green headband first that changed to red, then red shoes, then at the end the red dress).  There were other uses of red too such as with blood mostly to draw the viewers attention (such as the fishmans trail) but also with other small details I'm not entirely sure of their meaning such as the red phone in Stricklands room (perhaps to represent danger?  I don't believe it'd make sense to represent love there as I don't recall him calling loved ones during work).  There was a clear contrast between the overall green/teal ""of the future"" against the reds.  Even with the jello changing it over to green because it was the ""in"" color.  

With the cadillac car I'm unsure exactly which model that was, but I believe the car included quite a bit of streamlining design which streamlining in industrial design, though the concept began in the 1930's, was a style that persisted through the 60's and conceptually was associated with prosperity and the future which was essentially what the car salesman described to Strickland.  Streamlining was a style included in all sorts of items and was essentially included to help sell stuff with the idea that the style was ""futuristic"".  That falsehood seemed to fool Strickland as he bought the car and bought into this idea of a futuristic and modern man/family being one that is materialistic.  I thought it also represented how Strickland's family on the exterior seems pretty and modern but is only that way from the outside.

What really struck me in this movie was the religious symbolism.  Strickland recounts the story of Samson who is historically believed by many to be like Jesus.  Symbolically, there are many depictions of Jesus as a fish and his followers as fishermen.  That is because in Greek icythus meant fish and was also the acronym for Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.  To recognize other christians, the symbol of a fish or icythus was commonly used in the past during times of persecution .  The fishman in the movie is described as a god so I am pretty sure making him into a fish-like creature was intentional to draw comparisons between him and Christianity/Jesus.  However, in the movie I believe they briefly mentioned him being worshiped by aztecs which the aztecs also had a fish god, so perhaps the creature is simply a mix of various stories.  Elisa also lived above a theatre called Orpheum, a reference to Orpheus who was described as a fisher of men prior to the fish symbolism becoming connected to Christianity.  So it's also possible the fishman is a reference to Orpheus?  

There was also heavy water symbolism in this movie to.  In Christianity, water is heavily associated with fertility(as is fish) and rebirth.  In a way, that finale scene with Elisa and the fishman in the water was a sort of baptizing, as the characters are immersed in the water they encounter a sort of rebirth as Elisa is reborn into what she truly is, a fishwoman.

As for anime comparisons it is well known Del Toro is a huge fan of the work of Mamoru Oshii (director of Ghost in the Shell).  One of Oshii's lesser known works was the movie Angels Egg (a movie Del Toro has said in interviews he has seen).  In terms of religious symbolism I genuinely believe Del Toro got some inspiration from Angels Egg, especially in terms of the use of water specifically in the finale scene of shape of water but also the way christian symbols are depicted.  If you haven't seen angels egg yet I'd highly recommend it, quite an underrated movie.

Overall a great film that despite all the details I have been able to uncover I believe with a re watch I could uncover some more. The score and soundtrack really add to the air of romanticism, to the point where The Shape of Water felt like a classic musical. Alexander Desplat's score is whimsical and swells with love, along with some of the songs del Toro chose for the soundtrack. In particular, the dance sequence is an emotional high point thanks to the use of ""You'll Never Know,"" despite the absurdity of a woman dancing with a man-fish.

Guillermo del Toro's conscious attention to the movie's color palette makes The Shape of Water one of the most beautifully shot movies of the year. The palette predominantly green and aqua, as del Toro chose those colors to represent the land, sea, and their union when the relationship develops. 

Overall, The Shape of Water is among my favourite movies of the year and will be a serious Oscar contender.

Some side notes, this was one of the coolest screenings I've been to since the theater I was in was the same one below Elisa's apartment, so it felt rather surreal watching the theater I was in. Plus, Guillermo del Toro did a Q&A afterwards and he had a lot of interesting tidbits. He mentioned the significance of the use of color, how the creature was 95% practical, and how he was surprised he was able to pull the movie off on a $19 million budget. Another thing though, del Toro won't be recording a commentary for this since he believes the movie speaks for itself. Easily one of the best of the year. Beautiful and gentle. I was expecting more fish sex. [deleted] Before I walked into the movie I thought Giles would be helping Elisa cause he had a crush on her or something so making him gay and just having him help her cause they were friends was a refreshing change from the norm. I really liked how the main set of characters had some sort of problem with love. Elisa couldn't find love cause of her disability. Giles couldn't find it cause he was a gay man in the early 60s. Meanwhile, Zelda was married but unhappy cause her husband was useless and just dormant. 

Micheal Shannon was supposed to be the perfect man with the perfect family, but he always wanted more. Trying to get with Elisa, wanting another car, not really caring about his kids.     I liked the movie but I wasn't blown away by it. The acting, set design, and music we're all fantastic though. My big complaint is that the we get about 3 minutes of her and the fish man interacting in the facility. I thought it would have been neat to really dive into how someone could fall in love romantically with something that's not human. We get her giving him and egg, playing music, and a little montage. There was almost nothing to that part of the movie at all. We she is talking to Richard Jenkins and she says something similar to ""he sees me for who I am, and not the things I'm missing"" but we don't see anything meaningful like that happen between them. I really wanted the bulk of the film being her sneaking around and the two of them getting to know each other and learning from each other, but we get 3 minutes of that and a sex scene.

It's a good movie but I was hoping for me and I definitely plan on rewatching this one in the near future. *Copying and pasting a review I've posted for this before*

Absolutely beautiful. That's all I can really say.

Guillermo del Toro really achieved something special here. You can tell how much love was put into this.

Kind of felt like an R rated disney movie.

Truly though it's a love story that pays homage to the horror movies of the past. Sally Hawkins was incredible, the whole supporting cast was great really, but Sally stole the show. You really believed she loved the fish monster. This is her story most of all it feels like, more than the monsters. I only wish we could spend a bit more time getting to know the monster a bit, and feeling that love he felt for her, as much as we feel the love she has for it.

Still. An amazing movie. Do yourself a favour and see this in theatres if you can. Unbelieveable. Girlfriend and I loved the movie, but I think the romantic development between Elisa and Sexy Fish Man could've been fleshed out a bit more in the beginning. We get a couple scenes of her feeding and dancing infront of him and thats about it.  Did anyone else notice the amount of ""green"" references? I feel they directly relate to the life of the fishman. Giles first ad depicts a family enjoying RED jello. However, when he brings the jello to his boss, Giles is told that he should change the color of the jello as GREEN is the way of the future. 
Strickland is constantly eating GREEN candies.
Strickland at first calls the Cadillac he purchases GREEN, however he is corrected that it is TEAL, showing that he is against the way of the future.
Did anyone else pick up on these things? I loved this movie. And one part is really tantalizing. The little speech that the five star general gave to Michael Shannon about how he would disappear if he failed was interesting. Something about a hole in the universe in the shape of him and he would go to an alternate universe of shit. He would be unborn, unmade and undone. I took this on two levels. One on the surface where he's just saying ""I'll end you"" and the other which is a high level operative in a top secret government facility housing who know what else supernatural assets. Maybe he wasn't being figurative. I liked that. 

Also, this movie is kinda like Free Willy except the boy has sex with the orca and then runs away with it. Even so. Best movie I've seen in a long time.  Sorry for the necro, but I just saw this film. Does anyone think the way Strickland drags the russian scientist by the hole in his cheek is representing a fish stuck on a hook? My biggest gripe with this movie.  
LET ME FUCKING SEE THE FISH COMMUNICATE. LET ME SEE HIM SAY OR DO SOMETHING NICE FOR ELISA. I FEEL NOTHING FOR THIS FISH.  

God! So much wasted potential to make you root for the poor fish. If halfway through the movie the fish had died, I'd have felt nothing for him, and I blame the director for this. she fucked a fish lmao [deleted] I think someone could write a whole essay on the use of red and green and what their meaning in the film is.
My current theory is that green represents isolation/loneliness and red is love/ connections.

Examples: The creature is almost entirely green. It is represented as living alone all the time. A god in some circumstances. Gods are usually quite isolated. 

As the mute woman grows a connection to the creature she picks up more and more red. First her hairband, then lipstick, her heels, and finally her coat once they do the deed.

The neighbors work: he initially draws a red gelatin with a typical happy family around it. When he hands it in he is told that isn't what they are going for anymore (commentary on modern times?) and told to make the gelatin green and make the dad more 'happy'. Does this indicate that in our growing isolation in modern society we put on bigger and bigger smiles to cover it up like the dad? 

All the government cleaners and buildings, as well as most people homes are green. Does this indicate everyone is in jobs they don't like and lack a 'love' (red) for it? Hence mute girl wearing more red as she 'wants' to go see the creature? The micheal shannon character and the coworker lady both have unhappy home lives and their houses were very green (lacking in love). 

Mute girl and neighbors hallway is half green half red. They are great together and are probably the only source of love in each others lives (red), but they are also not the ones to fully fulfill each other. Neighbor guy cant have his romantic relationship and mute girl does not get the connection she desires as an incomplete person. 

Lastly, green and red are opposite colours that that really stand out from each other. Does it indicate that alot of the main characters also stand out or feel different in someway?

I feel I could go on but maybe I am making a fool out of myself and it doesnt mean anything lol. My only complaint is that Elisa and the Fishman fell in love to quickly, but apart from that, it was an amazing movie. I read all this stuff about GDT putting so much effort into getting this movie made....so I was expecting a much more I don’t know...compelling? Story. I mean it was good but all these accolades it’s getting I was expecting more.  Probably an inconsequential question, but this one is puzzling me: Why did the neighbour store the green pies in his fridge? I get that he was attracted to the guy selling the pies and so frequently visited the shop, but why did he buy the same green pie if he did not like them? And why store them later? Saw it last night. Didn't show the creature's fishstick.

0/10 I’ll just add I love how openly ambiguous the film is. It’s an adult fairy tell but del Toro is incredibly smart about leaving the film open to interpretation. He never makes it 100% clear if the creature is truly intelligent or just mimicking Elisa in order to get food and safety. The end especially is beautiful and ties in with Giles’ whole ideal, the happy Jello family. Ignore the violence and racism and sadness of reality, just eat Jello. It’s his gift and he gives it back to us the audience. Maybe Elisa was so desperate for love she fell in love with a wild beast that never loved her back and brought her into the ocean to die. But don’t you prefer the alternative? Isn’t that the story that you’d much rather be told?

**Edit:** I guess I should make it clear I do think the creature understood and loved Elisa, just that there was ambiguity there and I don't think a reading of it one way or the other is incorrect. Am I the only one wondering why this area 51-esque facility has cameras in the loading dock area but not in a room that houses a god-like creature??  I was left with and intense feeling of emptiness by the end frases, the way he uses the word “believe” I have a strong filing that the end where her scars turn into gils, is nothing but the mere belief that Elisa might have being alive after the two shots. Belief means not being able to prove that something is a certain way and despite not being able to prove having faith it it... so perhaps they lived happily, but maybe they did not... and this is a possibility from how we see the use of fantasies around the movie, like the little dance and singing bit in the middle. That really left me thinking that it might be a tragedy in the end instead of  the happy ending we’d all like to have ...  I loved Sally Hawkins performance. There's this certain presence and warmth she conveys from the films I've seen her in that's so intriguing to watch and she manages to do it here without saying a single word.  

I found the use of nudity and sexuality interesting. At first I thought I was getting quite a generous amount of Hawkins on display that I couldn't tell was necessary or not. However later I just thought to myself well the creature itself is by default naked, that's just it's natural state of being. So thus when she goes nude again I started to see it as her doing much the same.  

It was an enjoyable film. I was easily drawn in and sold on the concept despite its absurdness although a few side plots here and there added nothing to the film in my opinion. Pie guy and Strickland's wife told us a little more about Giles and Strickland's mentality and problems sure but nothing that wasn't already evident.   Seriously. Del Toro is like a modern day Aesop, or Hans Christian Andersen. I don’t think anyone crafts the fairy tale/fable type film nearly as well as he does.  I have a theory. Giles is an unreliable narrator. Maybe none of the characters existed except Giles and the bartender. Maybe none of the events happened except the scene where Giles is rejected.

Elisa's character is an expression of how it felt to be a gay man in the 50s. Elisa cannot speak. Giles also feels like he has no voice. He cannot express an important part of himself. He can't tell the bartender how he really feels.

The creature represents the bartender, or maybe just a relationship with another man. Something that the rest of the world would see as unnatural but perfectly natural to him. It is a mystery to her, but also alluring. Although the creature can't talk, she imagines that it must have feelings for her as well and tries to set it free.

The scene where she is sitting across the table from the creature and tries to tell it how much she cares (the song was ""You'll never know how much I care""), while the creature stares down at its food and seemingly doesn't hear, that also captures what it feels like to sit across from the man he is interested in.

Strickland is the overly masculine caricature of what a man is supposed to be. He mortally wounds Elisa, which is symbolic of Giles' rejection. But in the story that he would like to tell, the creature brings her back to life and they live together in their own world.

I posted a few days ago about how her character and her love interest in the creature didn't make any sense to me. In this light it would make a great deal of sense. Can anyone corroborate that? I petition that we refer to the asset by his deserved name, Egg.  This is hands down one of Sally Hawkins' best roles of her career and she never even says a word. We know how Hawkins sound like but just to see her flawlessly express her dialogue through sign language is magnificent. There is a scene where she’s acting her ass off as she expressly explains how she feels about The Asset and it really just gives give you chills because all of her dialogue is in sign language. For a long time, you’re so drawn to her performance that you believe that Hawkins is mute. In a MoMA Q&A I attended, del Toro revealed that he made Hawkins study silent film legends of the past including Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin to help get a sense of the character and how her performance should be. Well now knowing this kind of makes one convinced that Hawkins stayed up for weeks studying these films like it was a college assignment and it all paid off.

If all we’re going to get from now are on are R-rated films from del Toro, then I would want them to all feel like this where it is realistic and has a human theme within the realm of weirdness. Its as if del Toro saw “Beauty and the Beast” and literally said that his next film would be, “The Mute and the Missing Link Monster.” On the surface, this might be a strange story especially considering that there is an intimate scene between Elisa and The Asset (Don’t worry you don’t see any creature-human sex scene) but some way the romance between Elisa and the monster is believable. It earns your emotion for you to root for them the entire way through.

Director Guillermo del Toro does a brilliant job displaying characters motivations and fleshing them out at on a complex degree. Some of their arcs are done by the second act, and then some go on for a while, but it does progress the story and the urgency. The film has the visual beauty of ""Pan’s Labyrinth"" mixed in with ""Crimson Peak"" and the comedic tone of a ""Hellboy"" movie. While some of his past films were imbalanced with more thrills than a steady tone, this knows what it's trying to go for and excels at it. There is a balance with both the thrills, the humor, and the intensity. The story is predictable but the lengths it goes by having all of these likable characters helmed by a remarkable performance by Hawkins.

[I met del Toro at a screening on Sun](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57b35bff46c3c465f6192fcc/5a1dfe7353450a9c54d744bb/5a1dfe73085229dccc35dc4b/1511915127939/IMG_0431.jpg?format=300w)[and Hawkins when she came to my job months ago for Maudie but I found it relevant for this obviously](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57b35bff46c3c465f6192fcc/5a1dfe7353450a9c54d744bb/5a1dfe9a24a694106d17eb5f/1511915174506/IMG_20170607_114357724.jpg?format=300w) Saw the movie last night. It was so gorgeous. This is the first Del Toro movie I've seen and won't be the last. The colors were lovely and rich and felt like you were kinda underwater (not just the parts that were clearly underwater). 

I didn't know much going into it besides having had seen the trailer. I liked that the movie took you to a whole new place for the 2 hours of it. I felt transported to their world and saw a glimpse of their lives. The pacing was spot on, and the acting was believable. 

I also literally got goosebumps when the light focused on her while she is sharing a meal with her in her home and she changes into Black & White before dancing.  I thought it was interesting how Strickland explained Zelda's name meaning but not Elisa's. It's worth noting that Elisa's name in Spanish means ""Consecrated to God."" This film was beautiful, odd, dark, and touching. Peak del Toro for sure--another great dark fairy tale from him. It slowed down a bit in the middle there, but I wasn't bored at all, I just loved being with these characters in this world. I was immediately invested in it from the beginning. i was really hoping that the monster would heal Shannon's hand and cause him to see the error in his ways and redeem his character.  nope.  slit his throat and his kids grow up without a father. Man they really went in a different direction with Free Willy 4 This movie shows three marginalized characters- -a mute woman, a gay man, and a black working class woman--save another marginalized character, the Creature from the Black Lagoon. They prevail over the combined forces of the US government and the Russians. In that I found it uplifting and inspiring.

I want to make one other point concerning reviews I read about bestiality--what a double standard! Captain Kirk can screw every Alien Space Babe in the galaxy and no one says boo. Elisa has a committed, monogamous relationship with Mr Frog Man and suddenly its bestiality. Brilliant.
Best scene has got to be when Elisa tells her friend Giles to repeat what she signs and really listen to her. She makes him and also myself understand and take her love for the Amphibian Man more seriously.

Also, from IMDB's trivia 

> Elisa was a left as a foundling baby by a river, is mute like the Amphibian Man, prefers to express her sexuality in water, and lives in a home with scale-print wallpaper. All these point to the fact that the marks on her neck were never scars, but are undeveloped gills, suggesting that she is descended from someone like the Amphibian Man.

Elisa's scars are too similar to gills to just be a coincidence so I obviously noticed that connection but I didn't think about how she only had sex in water until seeing that. Looks like a good theory. I have one unanswered question ? Did his wife smell soapy and washed hand or ""man smell"" ?  [deleted] [spoiler spoiler](#spoiler) everything after this is going to be a spoiler so stop reading if you don't want it spoiled

Here's my theory. I believe that Elisa is possibly the same species as the Fishman but has undergone metamorphosis, similar to how Axolotls can very rarely undergo metamorphosis and turn into salamanders.

According to [this website](http://www.axolotl.org/tiger_salamander.htm),

> The Axolotl is a ""perennibranchiate"" salamander (it never loses its gills).

Elisa was found in near a river at a young age and has had her gill scars ever since she was young.

> An axolotl that metamorphoses prior to when it begins to reach sexual maturity will usually lead a somewhat normal life. It will eat the same food and behave in a similar manner to the Tiger Salamander

Elisa could have metamorphosed into a human, lead a somewhat normal human life and ate the same food and behaved in a similar manner to humans.

> Axolotls that change after they have reached sexual maturity tend to be very weak animals... They frequently become disinterested in food and it may be difficult to get them to feed at all.

I recall, during the first scene where you see Elisa, feeling as if the person I was seeing was someone who was malnourished and did not eat often or much.

> Perhaps most noticeably, they absorb their gills and their lungs develop in capacity to the extent that they can breathe air directly from the atmosphere.

Anyway, I'm not sure if it's concrete enough. I did read someone's comment saying they read the wiki and the Fish dude just had super powers and turned Elisa into an underwater-breathing creature but I'm going to just pretend like this theory is true because it makes sense to me.

Also, unrelated to the theory but just about the movie in general, I felt it was amazing. I have not had an experience where I went to the cinema and had such a good, wholesome time. We had a small audience, maybe only 20% of the seats filled but we were all sitting in the good section (middle to back) and only a seat or two at most between other people. The majority of the audience were cute couples old and young. Everyone there laughed together, people reacted well at other people's reactions. Everyone just had a warm, great time and for once, I didn't feel like I was in the cinema with strangers but I was in the cinema with other humans all thinking and breathing the same story unfolding in front of us. It really made the movie something special for me, for it to have that much of an impact. It literally made me go home, jump on reddit and post about it and I don't really post that much.

Anyways I've talked for too long. Hope the editing on this comment is good cause I had to learn how to put in links and quotes. 
 Honestly I feel like this movie is more Hyped than it should be. I mean there are some huge issues with the film.

1. Eliza accesses the top secret room way to easy. She accesses like it is her own house. No security or Camera's around. It just felt ridiculous. There was more security on the laundry docks which LOL was also terrible for a top secret base. Just push it to the side. Not even joking.

2. The Love story between Fishman and Eliza was rushed and there was no build up. Where was the Build up? I have seen better romances in comedies. There was no epic romance.

3. Useless subplots where the time could have been used to better develop Fishman and Eliza.

4. They beat you over the head the Strickland is a Villain and scum of the earth. They even add a scene where he hits on Eliza that is absolutely useless and pointless. 

With that being said I still gave this film an 7-8/10. Beautiful Art, Beautiful music and the plot wasn't terribly bad. The plot was just kinda of bland. All the actors did an amazing job. 

I did like a Quote from Strickland which said something along the lines of: ""Just because it thinks, look sorta human and can feel we shouldn't kill it yet we kill soviets everyday in war""  

 I'm intrigued by Del Toro's takedowns of the typical male leads from older eras. The villain was truly a wretched man, privledged but still suffering under the expectations of society and masculinity. The whole film is a reminder that America wasn't ever really 'Great' at this time in history, especially for people like our mains - the women, POC, LGBTQ, fish people. And yet it was stifling for white men as well, an era of artifice, where those in power were lesser by their homogeneity, lacking the camaraderie of those they oppressed and disenfranchised. And that's only a small part of what you can talk about. Sigh. I've fallen in love with another film. Del Toro always delivers. Truly one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen in theaters. If you told me the plot beforehand, there's no way I would've believed that this was a good movie, but it is an outstanding movie.  

For one, this was my first del Toro movie, and man, did he make an impression. This film was aesthetically gorgeous from the second it began to the moment it ended. The pacing, camerawork, etc. were amazing. I have to admit that I was upset when del Toro beat Nolan for Best Director at the Globes, but del Toro puts forward a really incredible effort in this movie.  

Second, the acting, across the board, was amazing. Hawkins, Spencer, and Jenkins were all as good as advertised and deserve all the awards recognition they're receiving. My friend and I both walked out of the theater ranting about how good Michael Shannon was, and then it just extended into us extolling each actor's work. Really really incredible work.  

A thoroughly captivating and original movie about loneliness, and that desperation we all feel to make connections. Loved it (which is still weird to me). They were both from the same river in South America. My thoughts...
I feel like this movie did a lot of things right but never saw anything all the way through.
I liked that the side characters got some sort of a background (ie Giles art and painting) but that had no relevance to the movie which is weird....
I did enjoy when Strickland's [wife brought out green jelly...that was a tasteful easter egg] (#spoiler)
A lot of things were missing. There was no build on the space race or the USSR vs. USA, so another aspect of the movie that had no significance...
 I don't understand why people are so amazed by this movie. 
I had a hard time feeling anything while watching. The whole love story is so unexplored, she sees the creature and suddenly they're in love! Without any build up so we should understand what she saw in him. Hmm. Clearly wanted to be an emotionally powerful film but fell flat for me. Completely predictable story at every point. The relationship was rushed and I didn’t really feel it. Didn’t like the main character, I don’t know what it was but it seemed like she was just horny and a bit creepy rather than sympathetic and in love. 

The side characters weren’t very memorable (why did they even spend any time at all with Giles painting career?). The villain was incredibly cliche and corny levels of evil. It seemed like the film didn’t know what it wanted to be, like how long it spent kind of being almost like a spy thriller on the escape and with the Russians. So much time that could have been spent actually developing a relationship and making us feel something. 

Cinematography didn’t even seem *that* special to me. Definitely nice at times but not even the best of the year by a long shot in that regard. 

The very end scene of the film was pretty cool but it was like 20 seconds of the movie and completely unearned. 

Maybe my expectations were wrong, but I was watching this thinking it was going to be a real arty romance film when most of it was like a *really* generic blockbuster movie. It was a bizarre feeling of a film that could have been aimed at children but included loads of nudity and fucking. I went out of my way to see The Shape of Water before it got the full release, not knowing it was going to get one. I regret nothing. It is my movie of the year. It's feels like it was specifically designed for me. I love the way everything looks. The vibrant colours, the 60's cold war culture and societal paranoia. The fact that it Stars a Mute character and it's use of sign language. The creature design that harkens back just enough to Gill-Man to elicite my earliest memories of watching Creature Features with my Grandpa. The beautifully handled and told love story that under different direction would come off as creepy instead of sincere. That black and white dance sequence when Elisa Tries to sing is beautiful.

It was an absolutely fantastic movie the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time. It's going to be a classic down the line This movie is incredible. It manages to be sweet, without being cheesy and it is weird while also being grounded.  Knowing it was a love story between the two, I kind of figured at the beginning that her scars looked like gills. So I got that right. Yay me!

Also Strickland (Michael) called Zelda (Octavia) ""the help"" and I had to chuckle a little.  Just finished the film. All I could think of was how could such a flimsy towel hold back all that water. And how long would it take to fill that whole room. It takes half an hour to fill out bath tub!  Doug Jones really does some of the most impressive physical acting for nonhuman characters I've ever seen. Start of the movie, every movement and reveal of his appearance is just pure shock factor, a hand here, a shot of his face there, just always thudding movement.

For the mid-part of the movie he's basically an animal, both when he's being tortured by Strickland or befriended by Giles. And then of course he's at his most human when communicating with Eliza. 

It's only at the very end when he [absolutely ends Strickland](#spoiler) does his body language completely change into a being that is beyond animal, beyond human. He inspires *awe*, the same effect I've seen in much larger movie monsters, like Godzilla or King Kong. In my opinion, if you are looking for a fairytale it was really good but if you are looking for a movie of the year then its not there. The awards it won except the best picture make sense I guess but the storyline is just not that interesting or original, this is a normal happy ending movie I honestly thought the film would have had far more of an impact if the last minute or so was cut out. Wasn't a fan of the whole him coming back to life, ""you are a god"", and them living happily ever after. 

My head canon is that the last couple minutes are her last thoughts to try and comfort herself in the face of death, but that's just me. It is a fairytale type movie after all This film uses the colour green and its opposite, red, in an obviously intentional way. But why? What does it represent?

Some green things I noticed:
- much of the film is shown through a green filter, especially Elisa's apartment and the military compound where she works. 
- her clothing is usually green but the pair of shoes she covets are red
- the asset is green
 - green lime pies
- the advertising Giles painted promoted something green
- the antagonist had a teal (i.e. green) car. He eats green candies, and his wife makes a radioactive looking green dessert

Also, after Elisa has sex with the asset she begins to wear red. Clearly a positive sign of transformation.  I absolutely loved this movie. My favorite thing about it was that it wasted no time in the ""reveal"" of the creature. I was worried it would be dragged out but nope, we fall pretty quickly right into the actual plot. I thought it was a beautiful movie and the acting was incredible as well. It was so beautifully weird.

I can't wait to see it again and again. And that Beauty and the Beastesque dance number was one for the ages. Michael Shannon is the true god The toilet scene with the guy washing his hands before peeing is a reference to the spanish movie Torrente When the sex scene came out of literally nowhere I was laughing for like 5 minutes straight and was wondering why del Toro decided to throw that in there. After all was said and done I thought this was a fantastic film and that scene that made me laugh felt right in place by the end. Almost like a modern day beauty and the beast but w tiddies and a blatant fishman sex lmao. I was wondering why it was called the shape of water but the last 10 seconds of the film were absolutely beautiful and answered that for me the best way I could have hoped for. 
Still didn't show fish stick 4/10 Anyone else have children at their screening due to the Christmas season? I had a few, poor kids' holiday is gonna be ruined by nightmares There was a moment where I was thinking: ""No, please don't go there movie you have been amazing so far!"" and it went there and it was way more beautiful than I could ever imagine. Second favorite film of the year! I liked this movie but a detail is bothering me. Why did the Asset need to live in water with 8% salinity when he was found in the Amazon? 

Which part of the river would be that saline? Not even the oceans are that salty.  I liked the movie. But I didn't clicked 100% with it.

The love relationship between Aquaman and Eliza felt rushed, and the lack of reaction of the side characters to the whole relationship felt out of context for the 60s or 50s. Shannon's character was one dimensional and overly cartoonish for my liking, and the advance that Jenkins's character made on the pie guy was totally out of place for me. 

But the premise and tone of the story is original, the OST was on point and the directing and overall visuals of the movie were superb. 7/10 for me. 

 I hope Guillermo wins an Oscar so that when he talks to his Mexican director friends and they're all like I won an Oscar for a movie about a play done in one take, and the other says i won for a movie done in one take about a woman lost in space , Guillermo can say I won for a movie about a woman who fucks a fish Is it just me or this movie screams Bioshock all over the place? I mean look at the set design and the surrounding! My biggest issue was the ending of the film. I believe it would have been so powerful if the creature would have went over to Shannon and cured him, then leaving him to think for the rest of his life about what he’d been doing to such a powerful being. Shannon’s death was easy. It was so quick.  After the movie my boyfriend and I got into an argument and I was crying because he laughed at the scene where Aquaman and the woman dance. Then in the car I realized I'm 24 and wished I was in love with a fish person from a movie instead of my actual, human partner. We made up after that. The Russian in the film was wrong. None of the actors spoke Russian natively and butchered half the words. Even the script sounds like it didn't get checked over by a native Russian speaker - it's like they used Google translate for some of it. It's hard to believe that they couldn't hire some Russians to actually make it believable if you understand Russian. Anyone underwhelmed? The movie is basically the trailer. With Del Toro helming I thought the third act would be insane but nothing really happens. It remains a simple love story with Michael Shannon attempting to stir trouble but being dealt with with ease. 

Gorgeous cinematography and good characters but not much to the story plot wise.

My nitpick: I thought it was odd that they would occasionally show the creature acting like an animal. The cat scene and others like it were so awkward when followed up with the main character sleeping with him. I never felt like he was above the intelligence of a monkey, and I'd take issue with someone having sex with a monkey. Wish we saw more intelligence displayed. 

Michael Shannon trying to go after the creature solo was very silly and led to a very unfulfilling climax. I'd have loved to see the creature be a real monster and present some more moral questions such as is the rampage justified and did all those government agents deserve to be maimed. Instead it's just one villain that really seems to live to be villainous getting his throat slashed after shooting people. 

It's mostly worth watching for the visuals and homages. 

 This movie had some interesting parallels to GDT's other masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth. I didn't think they'd go *there*. But they did.  And I was okay with that.  
PS I thought Shannon's performance was great too. I was not expecting to see Sally Hawkins completely naked going full on Emma Watson in the tub within the first 5 minutes The Aesthetic really reminded me of the Bioshock video game series.   I felt like this was a new take on Abe Sapien, as though he was far less human. A very interesting story, if a bit flat. I really wanted to see the romance build more, rather than the insta sex, but otherwise I was satisfied.  This is a great film and it's my third-favorite of the year so far after Blade Runner 2049 and Logan. All of the performances are incredible. Sally Hawkins does a great job conveying emotion despite being unable to speak. Michael Stuhlbarg gives a great performance as both a cunning Russian agent and an impassioned scientist. Michael Shannon is a perfect villain who has just the right about of ham in his performance. Richard Jenkins gives a perfectly heartwarming and heartbreaking performance that I'd say deserves an Oscar. Even Doug Jones was great. The dialogue flows perfectly. The story is beautiful. The romance is convincing and the spy plot is a perfect addition to it. The movie also looks great and has some incredible set pieces. And the score is great and carries the film since our protagonist can't talk. It's just such a perfect film. GUILLERMO DEL TORO MASTERPIECE!!! I have been waiting for this post to show up. 

Loved the film. Michael Shannon & Richard Jenkins killed it. 

Also Hawkins got cake.  I just saw it a second time, and I think I liked it even more. The colors and symbolism pop even more on a repeat viewing, Sally Hawkins and  Michael Shannon are just great, the musical number is so surprisingly well-done, and the score by Alexandre Desplat deserves an Oscar. 

Two questions: 
(1) Does anybody know the author of the poem at the end of the movie? As far as I can tell, the words are ""Unable to perceive the shape of you, I find you all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with your love, It humbles my heart, for you are everywhere."" I've tried every nook and cranny of Google, and can't find the source. Maybe it was a specially written for this movie?

(2) Why did Elisa have to release the creature in the dock? I get that rain fills it up to sea level, but why couldn't she just release him in the ocean and bypass the dock altogether? Maybe he's a freshwater creature so he needs water in the dock to adjust to the ocean's salt levels? Or is he not going to the ocean at all, and to docks lead to a different freshwater source? For some reason, this bothered me on a second viewing. ocean man, take me by the hand... Why set the story in Baltimore if you're going to have this ""when the rain comes, we'll put him in the canal so he can swim to the ocean"" farrago?  You almost can't turn around in Baltimore without falling into the huge bay that divides the entire state. Wow, pick a landlocked city in Virginia or something.... it's beautifully filmed and acted but there romance between the main characters just didn't translate. ""he loves me"" and straight to sex? It only takes boiled eggs to get laid? I honestly thought Amphibian Man was going to end up having the cat on his lap or something but no he actually ate the cat's head off.....I love Del Toro  Only Guillermo Del Toro can make a beautiful movie involving a Fish Man and a Horny Mute.  
  
Top notch everything from cast, directing, writing, editing, cinematography, etc.  
  
Also, something about Sally Hawkins I can't help being attracted too... So alluring. I absolutely adore Guillermo Del Toro as a filmmaker. However, I think this was my least favourite film of his. I was so sure they were going to wrap up Giles' (Richard Jenkins') story with his artwork finally becoming famous/respected/purchased once he saw the creature and created the artwork for The Creature From The Black Lagoon (which came out in 1954). Or was this implied and I missed it? With so many critics liking it I thought this movie would be bad. The trailers and concept seem weird and stupid to be honest. It was fucking weird I'll give it that. The creature was ugly as sin but that's kinda the point. But man its classic del Toro and the acting was top of the top. How she described how the aquaman saw her for her and the poem at the end had a couple of tears out that I havent seen since forest gump. Im a 35 year old man for got sakes. Maybe its because im butt ugly and my girl loves me for me  so somehow I relate. I felt the roles could be reversed with my girl in other aspects of our relationship where she represented the creature and I the human. But anyway, Shannon always turns in a great performance, but the star was definitely Sally Hawkins. Also Jenkins was hilarious the whole movie. The Poem at the end closes out the whole movie perfectly giving you so much more meaning to the title. Hope this movie gets all the awards it deserves. They made this for 20 million and somehow respected my time more than most 300 million dollar movies. If you didnt like it go watch the dark tower and come back and apologize to me.  Sure the story was somewhat cliche. I went it not knowing much but was expecting a fucked up movie and I got one. A really great one.  This one just came out on theaters where I'm from.

It's amazing. Every scene had me going ""there's never going to be another movie that will look and feel like this again""

Totally unique, totally captivating. It deserves all the the awards and nominations coming its way. I liked the visual part. The main plot...not so much. I was kind of weirded by human/non-human sexual pairing. And for a highly secure facility and top secret asset, Elisa sure did spend a lot of time alone with the creature (even bringing record player and playing music to it). Movie was unapologetically del torro. Do you like fish sticks? Best editing and best score are all but guaranteed come oscar night This movie is hard to describe for me. The great parts were great but there were also some glaring issues. While being a 2 hour movie TSoW somehow felt rushed while dragging at the same time. I felt the focus was in the wrong spot. They needed to have a lot more time spent on Elisa and the creature bonding/getting to know each other. Instead we get an egg, some music, then kidnapping and a sexual relationship. The feel of the movie was wonderful though. Soundtrack and performances were some of the best of the year along with some really cool underwater shots!

Also were we led to believe that Elisa wasn't really 100% human to begin with? They said she was an orphan found by the water and had scars on her neck where gills would be. Also the movement of water on the bus window.  I think my main tiff with this film is that there's not a whole lot of tension. The middle part had a lot of sweet scenes and it's not like the story suffered from not having enough tension (because there was a lot of tension in a few scenes) but I feel as though there should have been a bit more tension and pressure to find the Asset. 

But perhaps that's just my perception of generic movie formula getting in the way of what is supposed to be a fairy tale love story. Although I feel as though there should've been more tense moments in there, the story did not suffer from not having as much tension.   Alrighty I'm dumb, but could someone explain why Strickland was so obsessed with Elisa?

They had one or two run ins, like in the bathroom with Delilah and also giving his fingers and ring back, but other than that there was nothing. Was it just Strickland enjoying being more powerful? 

Cause in that scene with his wife, he makes her silent as they have sex and later on he harasses Elisa in a bit to get with her. Just a power thing or? If the sea creature can heal, why couldn't it heal the girl's vocal chords? The film wasn’t without its errors and was pretty predictable plot-wise but I have to mention how beautiful it looked and sounded. The entire film was colour-graded and lit in a way that always made it reminiscent of being underwater with deep blues and ~~greens~~ teals. Obviously there’s a very overt amount of water-imagery but I thought the cinematography was exceptionally clever. All credit to Dan Laustsen, who again is exceptional when he collaborates with Del Toro. Desplat’s score is also worth a mention. The seamless mix of golden era Hollywood scores with the quiet recurring themes was really enjoyable. 

Certainly not the best romance of the year (I give that to Call me By Your Name), nor Del Toro’s best (Pan’s Labyrinth) but a thoroughly creative and enjoyable film. 

Edit: I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the exceptional creature design on Amphibian Man, one of Del Toro’s most beautiful and subtle designs.  I saw this movie two days ago and I have not been able to stop thinking about it since I walked out of the theater. Just an absolutely beautiful film in so many aspects. The score, cinematography, and acting were all phenomenal. Definitely one of the best films I’ve seen all year.  Everything about this film was so beautiful. The visuals, the score, and the performances were what  stood out to me in particular. 

I hope Sally Hawkins gets proper recognition for this role. It’d be so easy for any other actress to play a mute woman who speaks in ASL over dramatically, but Sally’s nuanced acting with the role really held the film together. I can’t wait to see this again!  I have nothing bad to say about this movie. All of it is amazing... But, I have a cat a home so I was so sad when the cat died.  Abe Sapian origin story i swear.

I'm really happy they got to be together at the end. I wonder if Eliza is gonna get all fishy now. What an original movie. I was so happy to have watched it. I haven't been entertained so well by a movie in a long time. I love the feeling when you leave the theater in a different state of mind -- contemplating the emotions and themes of the movie and looking at things in a different way. I thought the movie was essentially all about .... what I want to say is femininity, for lack of a better word. More like receptivity and the female polarity. Some of the ""facts"" of the movie were so strange -- you could never fill a bathroom with that much water -- but the emotions were so real that to me I didn't feel cheated by the logical questions. It wasn't a logical movie. I thought the ending was great because it just put the whole story in lens of it being a fairy tale. It's not supposed to be a story where the facts make sense. It was about the emotion. I read some of these descriptions and have a way different viewpoint. Eliza wasn't lonely at all -- she was a happy person. The monster wasn't lonely. The monster was a powerful, spiritually connected being.  So its sort of just a straight up old fashioned story...with new creative elements. I dunno , that type of sap is just kind of boring to me.

Everything is so black and white, the good people are angels and the bad people devils. It just seems so adolescent. 

I though it was really well done, acting, directing, art, etc. It just wasn't pulling my strings or keeping me interested.

The model for this movie feels like such a throw back. I guess the hook is the monster love story, but I'd rather see all of those elements but in a different style of story telling, less cliche.

I guess the classic and cliched elements were intentionally juxaposed with the progressive and usual elements, but to me I'd rather someone Tell a story in a unique...to match the unusual story. I just felt bored on the whole.

But if i think about it....i do have an appetite for classic illustration, nostaligia and other things. This was no doubt Guellermo at his finest with directing, I always enjoy how he handles period and this was no exception. Maybe I just wasn't up for a love story. In fact the rain at the end made me want to go watch 2049 again, that tells me something. I just saw this last night (it's only just come out in the UK).

I enjoyed it, it's beautiful to look at but my biggest problem with the film was how little it developed the relationship between Elisa and 'The Asset'. 

I thought they would show him learning more sign language and them connecting more and more but it just never seemed to happen, how do you fall in love with someone who can only say ""egg""?

I love Guillermo del Toro's movies but I wouldn't rate this as one of his best. Man that scene where Strickland and Elisa are alone in the office was some tense shit. I just finished watching it and I enjoyed it.  For Guillermo del Toro films I still prefer Pans Labyrinth but this had a lot of great visuals and storytelling. Based on the final scene and the fact she was found by a river I’m assuming it was implying that she was somehow half fish person already which is why she couldn’t talk. No offence to Guillermo but I think this is his best film in a while Despite its simple and relatively predictable story, this is a technical masterpiece. The production design is gorgeous and Dan Lausten's cinematography is stunning. The editing is also constantly creative and jaw dropping.

The performances all round are brilliant. Sally Hawkins gives a nuanced and charming performance as Eliza. Shannon is also goes all in and is incredibly menacing as the villain.

It's a beautiful love story that del Toro himself called a fairy tale. It really feels like his love letter to cinema and it's always brilliant when he's able to go all out on a creative level like he does here. https://iwandm.wordpress.com/2018/01/14/the-shape-of-water-review/ Thought that it was beautiful, and the acting in the film was truly fantastic.  I was truly impressed by just about every actor, and could very much feel their struggles.  Wish that we saw more of the romance between Elisa and the fish-man, as in the end it just felt like they were... well, y'know, just screwing.  I didn't feel much of a romantic connection there. This movie was beautiful, well-acted, and nicely weird like I have come to expect from Guillermo del Toro, but it didn't do anything for me. Didn't laugh, didn't cry, didn't excite me for a moment. Every beat was right on time, but predictable. I both get why people like it and don't at the same time. [deleted] Damn good film.  Very weird film. Feels like there are deeper meanings to it.  Want to think about it more.  That's gonna be her Oscar reel scene for sure. I'm not sure she can beat out Frances McDormand (or even Saoirse Ronan) for Best Actress, but she really was fantastic. The fact that Sally Hawkins was able to pull it off so well in a language she doesn't even speak without even saying anything was jaw-dropping.  I want her to win Best Actress so badly because of that scene. Her entire performance was absolutely incredible but goddamn was that scene absolutely beautiful.  Literally brought a tear to my eye. Not one to cry often.

Related so well with my current relationship. The feels. He’d be the most perfect choice to bring the Big Daddies and Little Sisters moral dilemma to the screen. It’d be a big deal for studios since they’d have the first truly great video game adaptation in their hands  Parts of this movie seemed like literal homages to bioshock, especially the font during the credits sequence Get Tom Hanks as Andrew Ryan, and it's legit! Seriously!! I hated that he just gave them up - but the scene with the hole in his mouth and dragged by it.....  I was waiting for him to say ""you just shot them."" He probably thought the asset was already safe It was consistent with Dimitri's character to have one final F YOU to Michael Shannon. One final parting shot in the measuring contest.

The previous two scenes in which Michael Shannon makes Dimitri re-enter his office and knock because of protocol and later where Dimitri has Michael Shannon refer to him as ""Dr."" because of protocol was a clear set-up for why Dimitri could not help himself but to give one final F You. It probably did affect his health, it seems like he started coughing towards the end. Also people regularly commented that he didn’t look great (the scientist in the car), he looked sweaty and pasty the more it rotted. The amount of painkillers he was popping made it more bearable. I think the fingers are just simple symbolism of him losing his edge essentially. In the beginning he’s being praised for capturing his asset and delivering by the general. Next thing he knows it’s going down hill after the amphibian man bites off his fingers (which makes it a bit ironic that the amphibian man can actually heal people).  I felt the same way about the sex reveal too. I bet a lot of people thought it was strange and maybe even unnecessary, but I thought it was a touching and appropriate remedy for Elisa’s life as a lonely person who felt no connection to anyone but him. The fact that Zelda was so loving and supportive towards her shows that she’s an incredibly understanding friend who is genuinely happy that Elisa got something she’s wanted.  He was definitely getting sick. Speaking as someone who's has had multiple infections over the past few years, Strickland was clearly suffering from a very bad infection. Instead of calling the it quits and getting the infected appendages removed he clung to them for appearance's sake which only allowed the infection to spread and weaken him. If the Asset hadn't killed him at the end he easily would've died from sepsis due to his stubbornness.  > That said, I am kinda surprised that it didn't seem to affect his health with how black those fingers were near the end. I could have missed something, though.

Towards the end, Fleming commented that Strickland didn't look well, and Strickland himself was coughing and acting increasingly disoriented. Part of that was probably the fact that his whole life and sense of identity were collapsing around him, so he was starting to lose it, but his rotting fingers were definitely taking a toll on his physical health, too. was Strickland trying to commit suicide at the end? it paid special attention to how he only would take a single pain pill at a time, then after the general threatened to fire him, he suddenly started consuming like half the bottle all frantically, then shows him do it again. I just didn’t see the significance of him overdosing at the end I legitimately teared up during that scene. > That poem at the end. So gorgeous.

I cant find it anywhere, I feel like Ive forgotten the exact words. I was expecting a [""Not great, Bob!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpUWrl3-mc8) at some point.  it was told from her friends perspective, so she could just be dead and he sugar coated the story with her getting gills. I like that it was left open ended.  100% she is a different species or subspecies of fish person. The asset's power is restorative not transformative... nowhere else does it make a change to a being's nature. An orphan found by a river with her throat ""slashed"" and she was sown up by well-meaning surgeons who didn't understand what they were seeing. She's mute not because of a deficiency but because she's not evolutionarily adapted to speech. And from the opening, when she sleeps she dreams of being underwater.

But I love that it's not explicitly stated anywhere and another viewer would be completely justified saying they don't buy it. Considering that IIRC she was found as a baby by the river, and the scars were a bit too ""perfect"" (as far as then turning into gills later with the Asset's help), I kinda feel like if she could be partially be a ""fish person"", although not to the same level as the Asset is.  I think she was always meant to be in the water (foreshadowed by her the beginning with her getting pleasure in the water) and so she needed her gills/personality to get discovered and opened up by the right ""thing."" Just my opinion though!  I love how the ambiguity there at the ends mirrors the ending of Pan's Labyrinth. Both end in very similar ways, but have vastly different circumstances leading up to them.  Well, this is certainly a possibility as the Asset was shown to have only the ability to heal people/give people back what they've lost, and not give people things they never had in the first place, so this makes me she must've had gills at some point and the Asset just gave her back what she had lost. Or possibly, this was just Giles' fantasy of Elisa gaining gills so she could be with the Asset forever rather than the more likely truth that she simply died. This could also stem from Giles' feeling that Elisa and the Asset were ""meant to be together"" leading to him constructing an ending to the story that shows that she was always part of the same species as the Asset.  Always Sunny! I love when he's hangin with the cats afterwards once we gets them, but Giles plays it safe with the ""hey hey hey let's not play with the kitties"" and the Asset just gallops over to apologize  When the credits rolled, the two chicks behind me were like ""I don't see how she could bang that fish creature... *he ate a cat*"" :D He had too many cats anyways. 🤷‍♂️ Giles gets his cat eaten: ""Nah, dude it's ok. It is your nature. We're cool""



John Wick gets his dog killed: Goes on a murder spree, kills the city's mob boss and spawns a series of awesome action movies. I've seen too many things made in the past couple of years with cats dying. Why. STOP IT. Cause Elisa told her ""Tonight you get to eat pussy"" and he took it literally. We're gonna be three little Fonzies. We're gonna be cool...  Finally saw the movie today, wanted to thank you for this comment! For real, fuck Bruce. Sitting on his ass while she's in obvious need of help. Waste of space.  I'm a day late but was his name not *Brewster*?  > It struck me pretty powerfully because Elisa is this monster's Moses, breaking his chains, hiding him from villainy, and ultimately just trying to free him.

She was also found in a basket by a river as a baby. That was the moment that moved me the most. The image of him standing there in the empty auditorium, transfixed by the screen. It felt incredibly personal - like it spoke to the heart of the film's imagery. A quintessential del Toro moment.  I loved the theater scene too, and the Moses connection to Eliza is nice. But I think the movie that was playing was a different Biblical movie, ""The Story of Ruth"". Eliza's devotion to the creature has similarities to Ruth, as her story is also one of love and devotion. Ruth says at one point, ""For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried."" It's not hard to see Eliza or the Creature saying something along those lines in the final scene. 

The other movie playing in the downstairs theater was ""Mardi Gras"". Does anybody have an idea how that ties in to ""The Shape of Water""?  It wasn’t the Ten Commandments that was playing; it was The Story of Ruth, which Shape of Water shares many thematic elements with (a woman falls in love with an outsider, gives up her old life to be with him, even helps him escape when he’s captured by the enemy).   Why would the creature cure her voice box if she's already perfect?  I didn’t think he could. If his only ability was to heal then those were gills all along. She could never speak in the first place. On the flip side, he could've been moderately accepted or atleast ignored as gay several hundred years ago, or he could have been a successful furry artist today.  My boyfriend and I left the theater and I said “I paid $13.75 and didn’t see fish penis??” Loved the movie though  Thank you! No one ever compliments editing when it’s done correctly. Film editors are unsung heroes when they do their jobs well. I liked the match-cut dupe: while she's reaching for the security camera and we're expecting her feet to slip off that cylinder - then it cuts to his baton slipping off the counter, which (for me at least) caused a ""OMG she slipped!"" reaction for an instant. I thought that too, because I wasn't expecting a happy ending. But... everything about Elisa implied that she either wasn't human or was only half human. She dreams about living in water, she is an orphan who was found in the river, she has the unopened gills, she was drawn to the creature before she even knew what it was, like she sensed it was like her. So the happy ending makes sense if you see her as the fish out of water being put back in the sea. Didn't GdT confirm that the magic was real, and that the ending of Pan's Labyrinth was also real?  > Sexually Thrilling Undersea Dude (S.T.U.D.)

Thank you for that. I had the same feeling about the ending as well. I felt the “true” ending was the tragic one where they both died. Then there was the Hollywood ending afterwards. Reminds me of the last two episodes of breaking bad.  I loved it when at the end, he took the creatures hand and put it on his head to generate more hair. It was so heartbreaking to see him at the diner so desperate for companionship and rejected. That diner scene also helped to solidify that some people are outsiders.  One of the themes I took from this is we had a cast of characters who were pretending to be things they aren’t. 

Michael Shannon puts on this mask of a decent family man; perfect little house and family, driving around a fancy new Cadillac to present the image of someone he isn’t. Because at his core, he’s just a nasty little man who gets off on controlling others (quite literally, in once case).  He’s desperate to convince even himself that he’s a winner, but even his own fingers betray him. 

The Russian guy is obviously pretending to be someone else, in that he’s a spy; but he’s also presenting a false image of himself to his Russian cohorts. He’s not some battle hardened loyal soldier at all. He’s just a softie who wants to protect the weird water guy, and literally gets caught with his pants down. His comrades have guns, he’s hiding a butter knife behind his back. 

Giles is a closeted gay man who’s forced to portray the role of someone else. He wears a hairpiece and loves creating these fantasy worlds through his art. Unfortunately for him, reality doesn’t want what he has to offer. He wants to draw beautiful advertisements, but the world wants real life photographs. But what’s more real—the drawings, or the posed photos?

We see the same theme in other minor characters as well, such as the pie man who puts on a phony, folksy accent but is really a racist from Toronto. 

Ironically enough, the character who’s most true to herself is the one who can’t talk.  Richard Jenkins is a national treasure His character could be such a trope too. A closeted gay man who loves old Hollywood musicals. But he was so honest and beautifully drawn. The way he switched the TV over from the civil rights matches to the old musical spoke volumes.  He gave them up because he wanted one final victory, to laugh at and mock the man who was killing him. Was lucky to have Jenkins at our screening after the film. Lovely dude  There were a lot of little mythology references in there. Strickland had sphinxes on his tie, and Elisa was woken up by ""sirens"" (which also ties in to the water references). Seems to me like he was written as the living embodiment of America's worst qualities at the time: violent, nationalistic, gullible, racist, and fetishizing women who are silent. When he squeezed the pus out.. good god. I was so worried he was going to jam the fingers into Zelda or Rooster’s eyes. He kept bringing up Samson getting blinded

The only thing I was disappointed about is that I remember reading an early review back in September that said his death was extremely violent, so I was expecting The Asset to like rip him apart or rip out his spine or some shit, it was underwhelming just seeing his throat get cut anti-climacticly  His performance was actually my favorite in the movie. The bits of his actual life and trying to be decent to himself and his word really struck me, and especially as a villain that's more than one dimensional.  It was hard for me but Del Toro made me hate Shannon in the film . He's so electric as an actor and I'm always drawn to him when he's on screen.  So funny to watch this movie then watching Pottersville. Shannon really is at his best when he plays unhinged.  He made me really want some of the candy he was eating. It was a bit jarring on the first watching because I love Abe Sapien and you see the fish man and you just want to hear him talk . That's just the bit of me that loves Doug too as an actor  I mean abe has his own backstory that wouldn't make sense but they do look extremely similar and are played by the same actor! Amazing that he could put forward such an impressive performance all while running a Senate campaign at the same time. I felt that a running theme throughout the movie is conformity.

The Asset, Eliza, Zelda, Giles, Dimitri are all outsiders in some way (monster, mute, black, gay, communist), and they oppose Strickland, who personifies the stereotypical white American male values and beliefs during the Cold War era.

To me the teal represented conformity while red was nonconformity. Strickland is a “conformist” in that he is driven to succeed and be a decent man in America. The teal car attracts him because someone tells him that it represents success. His teal candy reminds him of the simpler times of his past and he obsessively consumes it to reinforce his belief that those times still exist. The research center is teal everywhere, as are all the workers, all there to support aerospace development to help America become the most dominant force in the entire world, especially over the Russians.

Red to me represents rebellion/nonconformity. Some examples: Eliza’s shoes/headband, the desire for green pie instead of red pie with Giles art, the cop lights tinting Zelda and Giles red as they look down at the dock, and the Russians and the “red scare.”

The Russians in particular convey an anti-American way of seeing society, which ties back to the conformity/nonconformity theme. All the characters live in a world that is dominantly teal, almost like they are submerged in the ocean. In the end, everyone is forced to live in the world they are presented with, and must conform to it just as the shape of water conforms to its container. Ultimately, the “outsiders” reveal themselves in blood red in the teal world. The color palette was beautiful! I definitely noticed the emphasis on green and felt there were some possible contrasts with the color red as well (Giles's red jello ad being rejected because green was the ""future"", Elisa's hairband change from green to red, the scene when she's on the bus and windows are reflecting red/green) but maybe I'm reading into it too much haha

Can't wait to see what others have to say too. The color green = future... this was emphasized throughout the film (at least three times). “Green is the future!”

Red (I believe) = love. 

My theory: green represents the future people predicted. There are several characters who emphasize this: the security guard was persuaded to buy the green car because it was “the future color of driving machines”. The advertisement agency turned down Giles the first time because the jello wasn’t green. Once again, the future is green. Red is out. 
In reality, green was very much a color of their time (literally), as were their mindsets. The characters who emphasize green the most were oppressive, bigoted, cruel people... but they were very much a product of their time. They assumed, incorrectly, that they would determine the future. They would always have control. That things would remain the same: green. 
In reality, the color that triumphed (in the end) was the color that all the protagonist/kind principle characters wore at some point: red. All of these characters were loving, strong, open-minded people. Red, the color of love, is the future. 
In other words, the world will become a better place in time because love always triumphs in the end.

I believe the film was a very strong current social commentary. 

Edit: I also believe this film will win Best Picture at the oscars, due to the social commentary aspect of it. It makes a loud statement. > green

That's teal. Meh. That doesn't bother me so much unless the toilet was dirty. We get so many gross germs from all the door knobs and money we touch that a little toilet water in a room full of water isn't the end of the world. another point: if you've ever poured a bucket of water into a toilet you know know that after a certain volume/pressure, the toilet flushes.  So, as the room filled up, the toilet's valve would have released and the water in the room would've drained down the toilet's pipe.   

Unless she closed the lid. :) I think that might be the first time I've seen sex scenes that didn't feel sexual to me. Even her masturbating just felt so real and I guess it helped me better understand that she's just a sweet girl with needs like anyone else. And then the actual sex with fishman I just felt happy for her. Nice body though, she got a phat ass ;P [deleted] I just wish they’d made the initial romance a bit more believable. Even if the Asset is an intelligent creature, I have difficulty believing it would be able to quickly get over being roughly dragged thousands of miles from home in a sardine can and brutally tortured by humans on the regular just because one human brought him a few hard-boiled eggs.  And kept it from feeling either gross or erotic. That underwater scene of them both has got to be my favorite clip from the past year's films. I didn't like the movie that much for plot reasons, but that fucking scene just enchanted me.  It's the future ya know! Maybe, but I think Zimmer and Greenwood are still the front runners. Either way, this has been a great year for film music. Yeah I think even the other frontrunners would be cool with him getting it. The music was more about the characters, he said the whistling is representative of Elisa’s voice and the accordion is the creature’s. It feels like way more of an achievement and instantly iconic The best actress race is brutal this year.  I keep going back and forth between Hawkins and McDormand, and I haven't even seen Lady Bird yet.

I thought the ensemble cast was A+++ in this film.  Every single actor nailed their part.  Was so surprised it wasn't nominated in Best Ensemble Cast for the SAG Awards. I was so on edge that whole scene. I was panicking like ""This is going to ruin everything, or at least destroy her apartment."" Nope. Everything was fine after that. I’m glad you mentioned the genre bender part. That’s something that really appealed to me with this movie, and a lot of others. It sounds contrived, but Logan is another one that had a similar effect on me.

I do want to give Guillermo a hug. He seems so sweet. [deleted] ""Loose Lips Sink Ships"" was definitely a theme! Not just Hoffstetler, but Zelda and her husband too. Zelda's shouldn't have told her husband, and her husband's loose lips give Elisa away to Strickland. Getting *fish hooked* away by Strickland? Hey man, I just want you to know that this was a really enjoying read and I appreciated how much thought you put it.  I love how Giles was like ""Oh well. What else can we expect of him?"" Yeah but fish dick I think they fell in love quickly because they both had a huge lack of real connections and so they latched onto each other quickly. 

She may have been the first person to show him any semblance of kindness and that humans aren't all heartless.  [deleted] Yeah same here I felt like I should've loved the movie but I couldn't. And completely agree with feeling bad for her and her attachment to Gil-man. Felt like she was projecting something that wasn't there and it was a healthy relationship for her. 

The movie had phenomenal performances, amazing directing and I was in awe of the production design. But the script felt predictable (dumbed down?) and far-fetched. 

Plus things like her singing in black and white with Gil-Man didn't help. Just took me out of the movie   I think it would have been great if Gill-man had spoken to the head jerk before slicing his throat. That would have eliminated any doubt that gill-man was an 'animal,' At the one I went to, it was mix of laughs and ""I hate this guy, but man I feel so bad for him right now just he just bought that car"" cringing.  That was seriously the most boring looking candy ever. I could just taste the shitty lime flavor. But he’s a man of simple tastes, not like all this fancy candy like nougat  Looked similar to lemon heads except lime flavored.  I imagine her fanbase has exponentially exploded after this movie. This woman is now a treasure!  > when Giles ended his story and recited the poem, I just started ugly crying

It me.  I’m one of the people who laughed during that scene and I understood the subtext perfectly fine. Don’t get me wrong, it was a beautiful message on love and loneliness, but at the same time you have to be honest with yourself to see that her sexual interest in the creature is somewhat ridiculous given how superficial humans actually are when it comes to sex. It’s not moronic to see that and laugh. And just because you laugh at something that was intended to be serious doesn’t mean that you can’t appreciate the value of it either. Sally Hawkins is such a tremendous actress. Deprived of one of her best assets, her lovely voice, yet she gives such an incredible performance. Such an expressive face, though did a lot with her hands and body movements too! I felt like the climactic scene at the docks [was the first real time that showed the creature could actually comprehend what Elisa was saying (based on his reaction when she said ""without me"" in response to his ""you and me together""). Before that, he was mostly just repeating the signs she made](#spoiler).

And then to build on that, [when the creature chose to save Elisa and bring her with him, rather than just escaping to the sea alone, I thought that showed that he was truly reciprocating those feelings of love. Not only did he protect her from Strickland, he actually appeared to resurrect her (or at least heal her, if she wasn't already dead)](#spoiler).

I do think those moments [were meant to be reveals and that we weren't supposed to know before then whether the creature was as intelligent as Elisa wanted him to be. But I personally think the answer was a resounding *yes*](#spoiler)!

Edit: Corrected spelling of Elisa I sort of agree. This movie wanted to be so much more emotional than it actually was. The characters were good and multi-dimensional, but the romance was not. Some of it just happened too easy. For the payoff to mean anything, there has to be more struggle, and I don't think there was enough struggle.  That's pretty cool! I saw Her (too late, I know) the day before seeing this, so I had the pleasure of recommending my friend see both a movie about a guy in love with his computer and a movie about a woman in love with a fish man. Not sure which is stranger. Definitely loved the color palette as well, I also noticed something too (reposting from an earlier comment I made):

""I felt there were some possible contrasts with the color red to green as well (Giles's red jello ad being rejected because green was the ""future"", Elisa's hairband change from green to red, the scene when she's on the bus and windows are reflecting red/green) but maybe I'm reading into it too much haha"" It's intriguing to watch del Toro tackle sex in his films. From my memory his filmography was very prude in a way. Then he starts making Crimson Peak and talking about how sexy that film was. And you have a sex scene or two.

And then this film just starts with Elisa stripping naked getting into the tub and masturbating. And there it's just describing the kind of person she is and her daily routine. It's interesting that he isn't using it for pure pornography. I mean, damn, he made human on fish sex not weird. 

Sounds weird to say, but I'm interested where he goes next with sex. > I love how blatantly sexual this film is.

Shit. I can basically give up on this movie getting a proper release in China. 

It's going to be *Lust, Caution* all over again. A shitty sanitized version released on a few screens and straight to VOD. Probably going to have to import the fucking Blu-Ray.  I honestly thought their relationship progressed a little too quickly. Maybe I'm just a prude. But the scenes in movies where the humans are communicating with another sympathetic species (Avatar, District 9, Arrival) always make me emotional, so I would've loved a bit longer of a montage like that in this film.

This one was more like ""*This* is an egg! *This* is music! Wanna bang?""

Still a charming romance movie though. Definitely feels like the happy sequel to Creature from the Black Lagoon. An interesting thought when you consider the protagonists: Eliza (disabled), Zelda (black), and Giles (gay).

The Russian spy is a bit murky in this type of consideration.. he was fantasizing about the mute girl (hence the ""silence"") - but yes, just another illustration of his desire for dominance/success.

the Eliza/Fishman scenes are certainly more artistic, even more so that her solo scenes earlier in the film, which are just as routine as the married-couple sex could be seen as. I saw it as more of a cultural thing, haha. How would the fishman know that they were keeping the cat as a pet, or even be aware of the concept of pets before that? For all he knows it's just some random animal skulking around. I think I remember the scientist mentioning that he needed a high protein diet and since he was freshly recovering from his escape the first thing he would've wanted would be meat. The cat was just unfortunately in the wrong place at the wrong time. :/ Am I the only one who found it odd that the friend didn't act surprised or weirded out by the fact that her friend had sex with a sea monster? They actually address this in the movie, when she’s talking to her friend she explains how his penis work. it felt pretty out of place. wasn’t an emotional moment for me.  When it ended and you get to hear what she sounds like, damn that hit me hard. It sounded like audible words but without a voice, and then as she finished singing, on the last line a speech bubble came out of her mouth and turned into subtitles. Man GDT fucked me up with this movie, it’s perfect   That is one of my favorite scenes in the movie. Like, I feel that the dancing part ""should have been bad/horrible/cheezy as all hell"", but it was really sweet and cute. And then when it goes back to reality, it hurt my heart.  That dance sequence was when this movie became my favorite of the year I was definitely expecting more based on early comments/reviews. A few people said this movie wasn't afraid to ""go all the way"" with sex stuff and I assumed that meant that actual penetration would be shown. Not that I'm disappointed that this wasn't the case, because the stuff we got was tasteful and intimate, but I am wondering what the hell people were talking about. > Also in this world many people are very okay with Eliza fucking a giant man-fish.

They were just happy for their friend! I felt no romance at all. There was no bonding. Just a silly scene where elisa does some stupid dancing shit, and done.  
I know nothing about the fish, about his personality. At no point did I see him doing or saying something meaningful for Elisa. What a waste.  
I'm honestly mind blown this got an oscar, some pretty terrible competing movies I guess. Also, all of the walls in the facility are green. And the punchcards they use to clock in. And the car they use to break fishman out. And the pies they eat. And the walls of the pie shop. And the buses. And the flakes they have to put into the water with fishman. And the cleaner's uniforms, and the headband Elisa is wearing. And of course fishman himself. It's the greenest movie since the Matrix.

The only visible not-green parts of the story is Shannon's home life which is offensively yellow, and Elisa's head band and apparel changes from green to red (passion) after she makes some sweet wet love to fishman. he ate a cat. I felt that after that he deseerved to die I didn't see how their performances were Oscar worthy.  Just finished it. Film felt flat. Unique but yeah it didn't grip me by any means.  he was just incredibly strange. i didn’t understand how he was so calm with the fact that his cat was beheaded  How was there any notion that the amphibian is mimicking her just for food and safety? I get that the asset repeats certain gestures back to her, but overall I thought it was pretty obvious he showed genuine semblances of care and affection for her, and I don’t see any point in playing that aspect of the story as ambiguous.

The only ambiguous aspect of the film was its ending.

Edit: on second thought, that’s an interesting interpretation because it makes Elisa’s forbidden love more tragic. I still don’t think it entirely works since from my memory the Asset shows a fairly advanced level of emotions, but this will definitely be on my mind when I give the film a rewatch. I really like your interpretation of this. Having both main character be mute but for different reasons was really an amazing element of the story. Only through Elisa’s expressiveness can we feel her love for Mermaid Man ^^^and ^^^Barnacle ^^^Boy, and we’re left to hope that his physicality in turn implies reciprocation. Also holy shit, this movie was shot and scored exquisitely. What I would give to see the world through Del Toro’s eyes, if even for a day. EXACTLY! I just watched it and the officials kept saying it was one of the most important asset and shit yet a cleaning lady can just walk in day in and day out without drawing any suspicion? Especially after the first interaction she had with Ocean man both her and the black lady was only given 20 mins to cleanup I'm glad they showed her jackin' off at the beginning. Most male directors would've desexualized and infantilized her, but the movie immediately establishes that she isn't naive. He said this movie is a culmination of his decades of filmmaking and it truly does show on the screen. The movie took four years to write and is truly something magical .  pretty sure they’re better off without him as a father. and there’s no way he was ever redeeming his character. Then you were not paying attention. He was not simply misinformed about the fish man, he ignored all signs of intelligence, and ignored the doctor who knew better than him. Even if it was somehow a misunderstanding, that wouldn't make up for sexually harassing a woman, torturing a man and the fish man, and almost torturing a woman, among his general racism and assholery. So not only would it be completely out of character for him to go ""jk, we're all good,"" it would be a bullshit copout ending if it excused all of his behavior beforehand. well the creature recieved some shots to the chest, and shot his girl too, even the most pious person would struggle to forgive such a thing. I felt he couldn't help but mock Strickland for thinking it had been some crazy elaborate, multi agent operation. He wanted to throw it in his face just how wrong he was. At least that's how I read the situation. Oh, and to move the plot forward haha Yeah, she was totally a, mermaid? We’ll call it that. It’s funny how in some tales, when a mermaid becomes human, or loses her tail, she also loses her voice.  Exactly. It's like her bar was set super-low: ""Must breathe air (at least sometimes) and be fine with sign language."" (which she already has two of - one good female friend and one good gay friend who both seem to love and understand her). Eliza and the creature never seem to have any meaningful conversation in any language, however, indicating to me that her bar was really so puzzlingly low. Made the neighbour-being-gay trope ring false -- like it was only written in because him being gay is the only thing that stands between them being a couple. If he were straight, the whole story would fall apart.  To my understanding, the ending dialogue by Giles was intended to present the ambiguity of the ""happily ever after"" ending... I interpreted it as him leaving up it to his own imagination and hope that Elisa were to remain alive, despite him knowing the true circumstances (she died after being shot). Forget get about the adult content. This movie would be boring for children. Why do people drag kids to movies they are too young to appreciate? The pie guy being super homophobic and then racist all in a span of 20 seconds was also a bit heavy handed.  Wasn't it a nod to Shannon telling Zelda the story from the bible about that dude getting his throat cut? Or am I remembering it wrong.  Holy shit, really? Wow, that's pretty embarrassing for a multi-million dollar film.  Not trying to say that you're thoughts and feelings are invalid but what's wrong with a simple love story? 

And about your last point; I saw an interesting comment yesterday saying since we don't actually know Strickland's fate. Was he alive or dead? It's possible that him getting his throat slashed was symbolism if you believed he lived. He got off on the silence of woman, telling his wife to be quiet and the same was he was attempting to seduce Elisa, and now his vocal chords are slashed and he himself is the quiet one. It may have not been a bombastic ending but it was one that left it interesting and ambiguous with the best of his films. What is Strickland's fate? What is Elisa's fate?  Agreed. I kept waiting for it to develop into something more. Some side characters got attention and there were a couple beautiful scenes, but the main plot was basically the trailer+happy end, no twists or surprises, no universal meaning beyond the obvious. I was only underwhelmed due to hype. Comparing it to Pan's Labyrinth? No. Pan's labyrinth is in a class all its own.

I thought the movie was good (although I did find some scenes cringeworthy). Unlike most people I thought the dancing scene was cheesy and I laughed, I don't think it was supposed to be funny! I do think it's overhyped but mainly because most people are unfamiliar with art house films. Jean Pierre Jeunet knows how to mix a clever story with beautiful visuals and mesmerizing details. Del toro makes beautiful movies, but sometimes the story isn't as strong as it could be. Yes  
She wanted that frog dick  
Enough to fill her bathroom with water, dude you know how much that's going to cost to fix?!! She fucked up the floor forever for some frog dick this movie makes 0 sense He likes his women silent and so a mute girl is alluring to him. He basically says as much. 
Story-wise it's a good way to have the hero and villain interact when they otherwise would have little cause to. You could also argue it blurs his perception in suspecting Elisa and Zelda later on.  For what purpose? I think the creature didn't see her as broken As much as I like Saoirse Ronan, her acting in Lady Bird just wasn't as good. She was charming and pulled off an american accent surprisingly well, but it's not like she gave the character a level of depth another actress wouldn't have been able to give her.  This is probably the first year where I think every actress who has significant talk of nomination deserves to win. I can’t even imagine choosing between Sally and Frances. I really liked 3 Billboards, and I love Frances McDormand. It's just that in every movie she plays the surly, smart, stubborn, lady. I'd like to see Sally get this win just because Frances seems to always play that character. I'm not even worried about Tomb Raider because I assume it will be hot garbage. At this point, Bioshock is the only thing that could save videogame to movie adaptions (or maybe Life Is Strange) I hate living in the universe where this doesn't exist 😩 >Tom Hanks as a villian

I cannot see it! Yeah and if I'm remembering correctly didn't Strickland say he was going to die no matter what? Would make more sense with how his character was up till that point to tell him to piss off or something. He drug him like a fish on a hook... I mean, he was a spy for Russia. They tried to make him more sympathetic, but he wasn't necessarily disloyal to his country; just this particular aspect of what they wanted him to do. If he could have used Z and E to steal the Asset to Russia, he would have. 

This actually felt very realistic to me. If he's going down anyway, why not burn two American ladies and allow the Americans to sow chaos among themselves?  One thing I was thinking was that Strickland is against all of the movie's misfits, and he envisions himself as an ideal. So he's keeping his fingers attached, even if they're rotting, because, given his psychology, he'll be GODDAMNED if he's going to become a cripple. Nope, gotta keep those fingers, got to be Normal. Everything is fine. I'm the model American man. I got my wife and two kids and missionary sex and cadillac. Nothing out of the ordinary here. I think that was just showing how his health was in fact being affected as his fingers continued to rot. I think he was just in a lot of pain but trying to keep functioning. Same here. The imagery, with the reading of the poem and the music playing just destroyed me. It was the most beautiful moment I've seen in a film in recent memory. “Unable to perceive the shape of You, I find You all around me. Your presence fills my eyes with Your love, It humbles my heart, For You are everywhere.” Yeah, in my mind, she died there.  I just get the sense with all the violence throughout that there probably wasn't a happy ending.  It really sounded like he was trying to deny reality at the end.  Also wouldn't she have contacted him at some point later to let him know she's okay?  Overall the movie was a blend of hard reality with a fairy tale quality.  It's ultimately up to the viewer to judge which won out.  I guess I veer towards the more realistic end, but I'm a very pragmatic person, so perhaps it's just a reflection of me.

 But yeah, completely ambiguous and wonderfully done.  Judging by what Del Toro thinks of the idea of Pan's Labyrinth theories, she probably has gills. I’m sure that if she died there they would have found her body Also, the scene where she is controlling rain drops on the train's window.  Dang you're right. Found by the river and sliced neck and they see it up. See up her gills. Makes sense.  Holy shit you just blew my mind. Thank you for writing out your thoughts. That makes me appreciate this movie even more.  That is some good insight. I would have never thought that but it seems so obvious now. I think you're absolutely correct. Your theory makes so much sense.  There was a theme of healing through the film, too. 

Eliza was framed early on sitting on the couch which was covered in Egyptian hieroglyphics. She (in)directly shows him to be confident (by staging a heist to remove the asset ""I'm so not good at this""), to draw his best work (with her and the asset), to realize that he is *not* alone (she's with him nearly the whole film). 

I might just be making it up, but it certainly felt as though Eliza was also healing the people around her. Where the asset had actual powers, Eliza used her kindness and compassion.  Yeah, she even said so in the film, that everything that happened in her life led her to the Fish Man that’s why she had to save him. But he saved her too.  And circling back to the intro. He loves his frames. Totally.  And what's interesting is I interpreted Pan's ending pessimistically and Shape of Water optimistically. ""No, don't play with the kitties"" made me laugh pretty hard. The fishman clearly felt *so* bad about it.  Well I think that’s probably pretty low on the list of reasons why that was a bad idea, but I get where they were coming from.  TAKE THAT BACK ""You got lucky."" Honestly I didn't even realize it was a different cat each time until I saw two more of them later together next to each other. Otherwise I am not even sure if there was more than 1 cat on screen at a time Well he had a herd of cats. Wick's cat was the last gift from his dead wife, it was more than just a pet to him To be fair Giles had a bunch of cats, so he probably wasn't as attached to them as most pet owners would be.  It's difficult... what could he do? Think of the implications and current culture of 1962. Crazy ass white guy from the secret government comes in to your house and starts threatening your wife, who is withholding info you know about? I feel like 10/10 I would say what ever I needed to to get my wife out of the situation. Better than what, just trying to kill the dude and at BEST getting away with murder? IDK man, you could get yourself and your wife killed. I think Brewster made the only choice he could have made.
 I was really nervous for them both in that scene where Strickland is in their house looking for info.  You're correct. I thought it was like ""Bruce-ster"" but I was wrong This is why I come read these threads because I love reading these connections that just go over my head  I’ve been waiting for someone to appreciate that one [deleted] Hmm, do you think this has to do with the reason Elisa lives above a movie theater. While a hollywood film of the time would usually end with a happy satisfying ending, Elisa's story is ""above that"" (if you will) and is more complex, leading to an ending that doesn't work out the way you might hope.  That's not why, that was just their version of a hug since that's what they did after the cat incident. Exactly, it's that scene which motivated him to help Elisa - they are both outsiders, as you say, but they have each other to help out. It was a blessing in disguise that he got rejected. Diner guy was a bigot.  I think the racist homophobe from the pie shop was actually from Ottawa. Seriously one of my favorite actors. He often plays a sort of similar role to this but he does it so well and it's so believable.  Good catch on the sirens. I didn't make that connection until my second viewing (tonight). > at the time

 What are you talking about? Strickland was the protagonist in the movie. A career-oriented family man has the one thing that could beat the Russians when a poor janitor lady steals it because she’s so lonely and desperate that she degraded herself by forming a sexual relationship with it. She did this well after Strickland offered to give her some of the attention she desired. And then like most monster movies the evil creature wins in the end.

                                                /s? Yeah, it was laid on thick. The movie should have cut his scenes by 75% and spent the time fleshing out the romance relationship. The irony there being that he sees himself as Sampson, but Fish-man was the Sampson here.  Yea I though the death would be more shocking since he told the Asset you are a God so I expected the Asset to do something like kill him without touching him or have decay from his fingers spread throughout his body. I liked the balance at the end of Strickland getting his throat slashed while the scars on Elisa's neck became new life.  I actually liked the way he died. He fetishized Elisa's silence and was eventually silenced himself by the (man?) that Elisa fell in love with. Yea and the scene where he's asking General Hoyt how many times does a man has to prove himself to be decent despite a fuck up. You understood his motivations. I love Shannon playing bad guys, I love Shannon playing good guys. I love Michael Shannon. Also the scene where they're first eating the pies, Giles buys her two slices of (extremely green) key lime pie, where he enjoys it more as he's trying to conform to the pie shop (a growing franchise that exemplifies the art he's trying to give to the world). She rejects it simply because it's not for her, she doesn't wish to conform in the way Giles tries to. The scene where he's kicked out of the pie shop is where he's eating a red pie and finally says something in revolt when the owner kicks out the African American couple, ""you shouldn't treat them like that"". That scene was just all encompassing of how he's ready to join Eliza in passion instead of conformity.  I saw another post in this thread about green representing sexuality that was very insightful, [check it out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7llz2i/comment/drn85rx) She did clean for a living  And also rooms aren't water tight.  That bit was clear fantasy. I agree. It seems like del toro showed us nudity not to just show nudity, but for it to be normal and regular. Which it should be. The nudity was not sexualized in this movie and we really need more of that.  I'm for both, I just thought it was wonderfully done.  Prior to that it was worshipped as a god so sexy fishman’s human interactions are probably still net positive.  It was pretty erotic tbf. > or erotic

well shit, now I have no reason to see it. The guy at the car place told him he was the man of the future. Interesting. Except that Gile's painting is rejected as too-old fashioned. Maybe too ""50s"" for the forward-looking 60s? I guess his boss went with a photograph instead, it isn't explained well.  I loved the movie but that scene had me thinking, “you want to destroy the floor? Because that’s how you destroy the floor”. Too many DIY flashbacks! No she wasn't supposed to be latina. Her last name, Esposito, was tradionally given to abandoned children. Thats how Strickland knew she was an orphan.  Esposito in Italian is kinda a 'no-surname'. I am from South America and had a neighbor with that surname (probably a descendant of Italian immigrants).  I think Zelda's husband happened to overhear his wife talking and not that Zelda told him directly. thanks man, that really means a lot Yes! I was pleasantly surprised at how understanding Giles was. I was expecting him to be furious and kick him out or something. If sacrificing your pet cat to a fish god in order to solve male baldness, cats would be extinct. [deleted] I felt the same exact way. The movie ended and people were clapping and crying and I was kind of sitting there like ""...huh."" 

I never felt emotionally invested in the main plot- their relationship never drew me in, really. I kept feeling like something was missing from it, or like they never presented a great reason for them to see each other sexually. Adding in the musical number was clearly charming to others but I found it really out of place and odd. 

In addition, I found the plots going on *around* the main plot to be more compelling than the main plot itself. I cared more about Giles than I did about Elisa. I felt like she was the side character in his movie and when it ended without real resolution for him, I was disappointed. 

Still a wonderful movie, gorgeously cinematic and beautifully made. But certain elements of the plot were definitely less satisfying to me than I had hoped. 
 A lot of people like that FuFu shit. NOT ME BOB! Never has an actress made me smile as much and instantly love her than when she starts tap dancing by herself as she’s leaving for work at the beginning  Color is used a lot in Del Toro's movies as another layer of symbolism (see: Devil's Backbone and Crimson Peak). Something also, Michael Shannon's character's candy was green.  Nah definitely a red/green motif throughout.  Not weird! 

Del Toro and Taylor seemed like they had something to say about sex in this film, and it sounds like Del Toro has been inching this direction. Maybe he was cautious because he might be nervous about that topic. I’m so excited to see if he stays on it for a bit.

I love seeing someone explore something they’re interested in. Something they may have been hesitant with before. I get to reap the benefits of their passion. In fact, Del Toro may be able to say things that many people are thinking, but don’t know how to communicate - myself included.

 Damn, you can't have sex/sexuality in movies in China? The spy saw himself as a scientist first, before all politics (per his scenes). If the characters are a commentary on current affairs, it could be that his character represented the politicalization of scientific inquiry (climate change, evolution, vaccines, reproductive health, hormonal role in gender identification, etc.). Ah yes, the four most vulnerable minorities

* black

* disabled

* gay

* fish Ah I didn’t catch that he was fantasizing about Eliza on that viewing.  She knew it was coming  I realize I'm super late, but I just watched this. I'm with you on this scene. I wasn't really a fan of it at all. Seemed weird to me.  I agree, should have been cut out entirely. Felt cringey and out of place.

Loved the movie but the pacing was a bit slow and the run-time was a little too long. Yes! I honestly did not like the musical number itself, but the fact that it went back to her just barely squeaking out what she wanted to say made the whole scene so worth it. It was true alchemy. All the moments of movie musicals and tap dancing before set us up for that peek into her heart at the moment. It was telegraphed in the most beautiful way.  >actual penetration

“Back to the lab, full penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Full penetration. Crime. Penetration. And this goes on and on and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of ends.” Considering how some people had over-exaggerated the cat death part prior to me seeing the film, I wasn't too surprised that the fish sex part ended up being ""somewhat over-hyped"" as well.  well, the guy does explain to Elisa later that it is not the monster's fault, it is wild and saw the cat and was hungry. And later as he gets his wound tended, he tells the monster again that it is okay he isn't angry at him. 

He is just a very rational guy, understands the creature is acting on his wild instincts and doesn't know any better.  If you watch his response especially after the musical number it definitely looks as if he is not responding to her at all.  Yeah the build-up of their relationship just wasn't plausible. There's no way she's able to have lunches with this creature as casually as she's able to. That room would be on 24/7 lockdown with security around the clock.  the heroes murdered a guard for no reason Someone over on r/fixingmovies suggested that it would have worked better if the black couple had come in thirty seconds earlier. Skip displaying the homophobia and the gay man acting very uncharacteristically bold, but show that the dude he's crushing on is actually a dickbag. Makes the character stronger, too, because he's not helping because he was rejected - he's helping because he realised he's a decent person. I thought it paralleled nicely with his telling Elisa that he could make her squawk. > it's not like she gave the character a level of depth another actress wouldn't have been able to give her.

They're all professional actresses. Who's to say that only one actress can give a certain level of depth to a specific role? Hanks can look the part but I don't think he has the voice. I'd prefer Jon Hamm.  Would you kindly check out [this picture](https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/image_1bf414aa.jpeg)

[Andrew Ryan for comparsion](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bioshock/images/0/00/Andrew_Ryan.png/revision/latest?cb=20151030102044) I think he was mocking Strickland more than giving them up. Like, ""You asshole, you're so fucking dumb, you got taken by the cleaning staff"". Yea Strickland says something to the effect of you are shot in the stomach and you are going to die. Then he gives them up (after a few shocks though). I think it was consistent with the way his character is sort of single minded in his scientific interest and awe of Fish Guy. Like its the same sort of action as when he kills the guard to break them out (and I don't remember him seeming particularly remorseful then). He doesn't have an enormous respect for human life and doesn't really know what Elisa and Zelda's motivations are. Helping them was more of a hail mary for him than an act of compassion I think.

It did make me angry though because he was usually so sympathetic And threw him onto a pile of salt He pretty clearly didn't dislike them, though. He seemed like he wanted to save the Asset over his loyalty to Russia though. That's why he risked his life by first not destroying the Asset and then lying to his superiors and saying the Asset was destroyed. I’m not sure I buy this. He clearly liked the American ladies, and even if he didn’t, he was pretty intent on saving the mermaid asset thing.  His loyalty to Russia died the moment he found out his superiors didn't want to learn, they were also okay with their rival not learning (and killing the opportunity) I think I like this explanation the best, combined with his composure literally decaying There's some credence to her living due to his demonstrated healing ability, but I think the gills thing is totally up to interpretation.  Here's a quote from an interview he did about it 


MG: I'm glad to hear you say that. This is the dispute going on among people who have seen your film. Was Ofelia in her fantasy world? Was it a real world? I keep saying such questions pose a false dichotomy.

Del Toro: Yes, of course. And it's intimate. If the movie works as a piece of storytelling, as a piece of artistic creation, it should tell something different to everyone. It should be a matter of personal discuL.pssion. Now objectively, the way I structured it, there are three clues in the movie that tell you where I stand. I stand in that it's real. The most important clues are the flower at the end, and the fact that there's no way other than the chalk door to get from the attic to the Captain's office.

 How does he feel about them? But the canals opened that day, the body would have been washed out and at best a Jane Doe in another location. Yeah, seems like most people missed that she was moving them against the wind. 

Also, I believe her diet is very protein heavy just like the doctor recommended for Fish Man (wish he had a name). That part was unclear to me. I thought either she was imagining it, like in the musical scene, or if there was a fantasy element it was because she came in contact with the Fish Man. It never came up again though. Also, she always masturbates while in the bath. Definitely has a love for water. I found Pan's ending optimistic in that the happy ending would wait for another generation and another time.

Captain Vidal's son will grow up never knowing him and his generation would help to ensure that fascism in Spain would die with Franco. Should have given him even more hair then lol. Though that is a nice gift It was a dog.  Especially the crazy ass white guy who just ripped off his fucking rotted fingers wtf. He was probably scared shitless and I really don’t blame him. Just because a character doesn’t act like a super hero protagonist doesn’t mean he is evil or a cowardly. I think its impressive he even kept calm. He could get off his ass and answer the damn door I've seen it four times now, so I've had a lot of opportunities to pick up on some of the smaller details 😁 > I think they established the healing abilities of the creature well enough that I believed that he could plausibly have healed himself

Especially given that they specifically mentioned the ""thick cartilage plates"" in his chest, I thought it was clearly set up that The Asset could have taken those shots. Elisa, could go either way  I took it as both, kind of like ""goodbye, nice knowing you, maybe give me a few more hairs while we're at it"" To me it seemed he was hoping for one last burst of hair magic, but when nothing happened he accepted it and touched the creature's head as a gesture of thanks  Also remember that he had previously turned a blind eye to the plight of outsiders. When Elisa had the civil rights riots on tv he had her turn it off. *sigh* the one time Ottawa gets mentioned in a movie and the guy ends up being a racist homophobe :P Saw this movie in Ottawa, theatre chuckled at the mention  >*at the time* god YES. My girlfriend and I were complaining about this. I loved Michael Shannon's acting but dear LORD why did I have to see him fucking his wife? Why did he have to be in so many shitty scenes? Less angry 'murica guy, more fish and woman romance Fishman wasn't Samson, Fishman was God. He literally gives Samson his hair back.  I can’t get over how perfect that “you are a god” line was. It’s like he’s admitting he’s been wrong the *entire* time It showed sexuality as such a beautiful and human (and I guess fishman) thing.  Fair point, I hadn’t considered this. I guess the eggs could be construed as an “offering” of sorts.  Yeah we all started jacking it at the theater  It is, however, erquatic. I thought that was the boss guys being nice to him and letting him down easy. I think they were forcing him out because someone found out he was gay. All the signs we see and other art in the movie are all painted. I didn't notice anything that was actually a photo to support what the boss was saying. I enjoyed it too :) thanks.  You know what's funny? Rogaine is very poisonous to cats, so a lot of balding people with cats are confronted with that decision (No fish-God involved, though) Same. I enjoyed their romance, but wish there were one or two more scenes showing the evolution of it. I could easily see why Eliza felt she was in love (connecting with a voiceless outsider, her love for fantasy and movie musicals, a bit of the Florence Nightingale effect of rescuing/nursing the creature). But it would have been nice to see more from the creature's perspective. If his vocabulary had expanded beyond ""egg"" and ""music"", maybe we could have seen a deeper expression of his love for Eliza. I agree with you that it would be really nice if we saw more of them bonding throughout the movie. I can easily see why some people don't believe them being actually in love (at the very least in the Asset's case). I can't remember how many days had passed between them first meeting, and Elisa attempting to free him at the docks, but I had just assumed everything had happened ""off-camera."" 

Maybe there were some scenes that were cut? I am wondering if there would be any extra scene in the eventually BluRay/DVD release. And you can feel her joy after her and the Asset consummate their relationship - like you feel her smile it's contagious. It's usually deemed pornography, sadly. It's strange because it seems right up my alley (a musical moment out of nowhere that breaks the fourth wall so the character can belt out her I Am song) but I didn't feel much in that scene at all. Maybe I had been turned off too much by other elements of the movie. The only thing over the top about that sex scene was how no one seemed to give a shit that it happened. That whole conversation with Zelda kind of left me wondering why the only question of any concern to her was the logistics of it. Probably because she's signing things very quickly that he doesn't understand. Plus he's eating so he probably just zoned her out. I also didn't get the feeling that the creature was just mimicking, as even the Russian scientist immediately realized that the two had a deeper connection and reported it to his higher ups. There’s no doubt to there being a beastly aspect to the Asset, and he also isn’t on the same evolutionary scale as Abe Sapien.

That scene does reinforce distance between the two characters, and a slight sense of tragedy to their forbidden love.

But I still don’t see the Asset as a cold, simple animal that hadn’t eaten Elisa only since she was protecting him. That would require an odd sense of calculated manipulation from him throughout the movie. 
 Yea and they keep stressing the Russians were after that asset so It makes absolutely no sense to have no security around it or a record of ppl entering  Ok, I'll phrase it a little differently: I have seen other actresses do what Saoirse Ronan did in Lady Bird with around the same level of skill and effectiveness. I have never seen something like Sally Hawkins' performance. I feel like Jon Hamm could be Jack. That's the way I took it. I think Dimitri thought he was too stupid to figure it out. Which, granted, is an absurd thing to gamble, but I can see why he would try to mock him one last time I suppose it might have been instinctual then.

By the way, quite the Boardwalk Empire reunion for Rothstein and Van Alden! Her friend also said she was found by water with those marks on her as a kid, so she may have been a fish the whole time. Idk something me and my friends came up with. “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”

- Albus Dumbledore  He believes in the fairytale ending instead of the depressing 'realistic' one. So in his eyes Ofelia really is reborn as a Princess in the Underworld instead of just dying a miserable death at the end of the movie.  That happened right after she fucked the merman, which implies that she got some of his powers through him. If you take it out of the story structure, then sure, what you're saying makes sense. 

She also ate half an egg sandwich for breakfast, and another half for lunch (packed into the brown paper bag), which is nothing in terms of protein.  Her couch was hard as fuck. I don't blame her. Nah you're thinking of a different movie or something. I'm talking about John Wick, the Keanu Reeves movie.  Also, the ""SIT. DOWN."" was fucking terrifying  I don't think he had Elisa change the channel because he didn't care about the civil rights riots happening, but it was more of a ""seeing that depresses/bothers/upsets me, so I don't want to  watch it."", hence why he had her turn to one of the music programs instead (since watching those programs really cheer him up). 

Plus, he actually got at the pie guy in the diner for not allowing the black couple that walked in to sit down and get something to eat. So I don't think he was really turning a ""blind eye"" earlier in the movie.  There is an Ottawa, Kansas. Let's pretend he's from that one. There was wayy too many fish sex scenes for me. I didn't need more. His portrayal of that reaction was great. Like he definitely realized he fucked up and was wrong. It happened at your theater too? At the end of the movie, we do see him repeat the ""you. and me. together"" part to Elisa when she was trying to get him to leave the docks, and he was even hesitating to leave her, which was a nice touch. But still, there really should have been a few more romance scenes from the Asset's POV. Also, had Strickland not found out and gone to the canal, she would have never been shot, meaning she would have never been saved and would have left alone, which would have ruined the beautiful and well-earned storybook ending. It still could have been done a bit better with him dropping his notebook or some other clue rather than him just spilling the beans!  He was a spy so you have to imagine he had nerves of steel and trained for serious interrogation (even if he was a scientist). Like when he was questioned before he deflected well to Strickland and was ready to kill the other guys with a butter knife.

Yes it was an amusing reunion! They pretty much spelled that out. The only thing that doesn't make sense is that she didn't need a specific salinity or that other seaweed looking stuff. She could be the product of a female fish-god and male that went through a similar thing in the past though. Only way I could see the theory working.  Yeah, John Wick had a DOG.  That’s just Michael Shannon ""Turning a blind eye is an idiom describing the ignoring of undesirable information."" I'm not saying that he wasn't aware what was going on, but he wasn't interested in learning about it. Furthermore I think it would be an incomplete interpretation of the movie if you dismiss the diner scene as a pivotal point in his character. I thought it was mandatory  Oh shit.. I dont think the storybook ending really happened It was also further reinforced by his initial refusal to help the creature.  Out of sight, out of mind -- but he had an arc that changed him by the end of the film.
 But all the rest of a giant anthropomorphic sea monster did? If you believe that then I think the ending is totally plausible. Exactly. He didn't identify with the other until that part. But if this was all the fevered dream of a reclusive artist in decline and only cats for friends, none of it really happened.
 You telling me he ate his own cat? ",1
171,"I loved how the dream sequence, while was hilarious, was just setting up for a even BIGGER laugh in hotel when Gosling was looking for Crowe's ankle gun. A stroke of genuine comedic genius in the writing right there. I haven't laughed this hard in awhile, that Nixon scene caught me completely off guard. you know what I really appreciated about the movie? Neither of the leads had a love interest. That felt refreshing I thought all the goofy mishaps by Gosling were going to get old and stale after about 30 minutes of it. Boy was I wrong. Shit just kept getting funnier and funnier every time.  Gosling preparing himself behind the corvette and not realizing the platform was spinning might have been my favorite movie moment ever.  [deleted] The movie was great all around but I was astounded by how well Holly was handled. So often trying to include a tween or young teen as an active participant in an adult oriented adventure movie rings false to me. Like, what parent would allow that? Thanks to the writing and acting not only did Holly belong, I can't imagine the movie without her. The young actresses' chemistry with Russell Crowe legitimately made me believe the threat of silent treatment was enough to make badass Healy spare a scumbag assassin's life.

EDIT: Autocorrect created the new actor Russell Crowd. ""Detroit killed my daughter.""

""Yeah. Whole city had a vote. Everyone showed up.""

I laughed *so* hard. The entire film was stupidly hilarious and really, really solid. It's nice to see Shane Black do a film that calls back to his roots.  I firmly believe that this movie should spawn a new Oscar category just to give Ryan Gosling an award for that magical 'discovering the corpse' scene. That was pure art.

This film was absolutely excellent. Great upbeat noir feel, great music, incredible chemistry between the leads, and a spunky kid sidekick that is not only not painfully annoying, but one of the best parts of the movie. There's nothing I can say about this movie that will stand out from the rest of these comments, but it was a really great movie. All of the actors nailed their characters, the jokes were smart, and the story was clever. 

Go see this movie.  ""Wait so you made a porn movie and the plot was the point?"" Did *not* see Amelia dying... 
The actress that played Holly was fantastic. It's nice seeing Ryan Gosling taking on these different types of roles, he played the comedy really well. His and Crowe's dynamic was hilarious and super fun to watch and stuff. One thing I really appreciated on a second viewing was how well Black sets everything up. From the actual crime elements to the great comedic moments like the ankle gun or Nixon, he knows how to weave these bits into the film and never fall victim to obvious telegraphing like he made fun of in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

>Okay, I apologize. That is a terrible scene. It’s like, why was that in the movie? Gee do you think maybe it’ll come back later? Maybe? I hate that. It’s like the TV’s on, talking about the new power plant, hmm, wonder where the climax will happen? Or that shot of the cook in Hunt For Red October? So anyway, sorry.

Overall I really enjoyed this film. The film is as 70s retro as you can possibly get and I love it for that. LA in the 70s is a great time to set a detective story and the chemistry between the quite brute Russel and the over-the-top whiner Gosling is just perfect. I hope this makes a bit of money and Shane Black can do more cause I really enjoy this cast.
 I really enjoyed the running gag of Ryan Gosling talking about things never working out, and then the whole movie being a series of coincidences that lead to him solving the case. I also liked that no one explained that in the film. This movie kind of reminded me of The Big Lebowski and Boogie Nights. ""Jesus Christ!""

""Don't use the Lord's name in vain!""

""I actually found it quite useful"" Just got back from seeing this film and holy hell what a great movie! The story was fun and interesting, and Russell and Ryan had such great chemistry! I was laughing throughout! If anyone in here was on the fence please do go see it! We as a community should work to support more movies like these that aren't remakes or franchises,( not that there is anything wrong with remakes and franchises, but it is always nice to see an original movie do well) Ryan Gosling was great. Loved the falling jokes Really satisfied and impressed with this movie.  I was smiling and laughing pretty much the entire time.  Super stylish and slick buddy-cop-70's-comedy.  I was surprised how I couldn't really predict where the story was going.  When Matt Bomer shoots Amelia, I was dumbstruck as to what the hell was going to happen next.  The gun in the ankle sequence especially Gosling's reaction and then the daughter's attempt at saving the day with the coffee pot posing as room service might have been one of the funniest sequences I have seen in film  
  
I love how Black fucks with those action movie conventions, e.g. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with Russian Roulette How the fuck does this film have a B- Cinemascore while Angry Birds has a B+? This movie was hilarious and stuff. Better than Kiss Kiss Bang Bang IMO ""I'm the head of the Department of Justice.""

""Oh, great, that tells us absolutely nothing."" I thought Ryan Gosling absolutely KILLED it in this role. Like, he was so amazing in my opinion, not to discount Russell crowe at all. The chemistry between them was also marvelous. The film was great. A good, original film with great chemistry between leads (including holly). Oh man Goslings lines with the kids were fantastic. ""You're sisters such a slut."" I don't think I've been this impressed with the buddy cop genre in a long long time, which makes sense because Black also wrote perhaps the greatest buddy cop film of all time (lethal weapon). It was a great film, and I'd recommend anyone to see it. dude just tossed that bitch out the window damn Loved the movie, but I cant help and think that Keith David was greatly underused. TIL I learned that the guy who plays Chet is Val Kilmer's son, which I think is kinda neat since Val Kilmer was in *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*. Also did anyone else think the 'Blue Face' henchman really looked like Sasha Baron Cohen?  ""Your sister is such a slut!"" ""I'M NOT HERE TO HURT YOU! I'M JUST LOOKING FOR MY GUN"" You know who was just following orders?....Hitler I think this is one of those movies that will be good for watching again to catch all the background dialogue and visual jokes.
One of my favorite lines: ""Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate.""
 I loved every second of it. One thing I noticed was early in the film, Gosling gets punched and falls to the ground, and for a moment you can see his wife's wedding ring on a necklace. I don't think it's ever noted, but I loved that little detail. Incredible film Young porn lady - Gosling 

I lost it.  ""-Where is your ankle gun? Where is it? 
- What ankle gun? 
- Fuck that was a dream"" 

I dont remember if that quote is nearly accurate to the movie's one , but that really did the trick for me since i forgot he only saw the gun in his falling asleep behind wheel dream. 
Overall this movie isnt a masterpiece since it got setup very standard way and it is the same way troughout it. We got car accident to put the audience in the middle of the action, then we meet our protagonists, they meet each other, etc etc. NOT like it is bad, but with that said you never feel like either march or healy going to die in next scene or if the girl is Not supposed to solve criminal cases in the middle of a porn party. Or Maybe i watched too much michael mann or Game of thrones lately. 

Summing up this is really good goofy 70' criminal movie. It had a vibe of PTA's Boogie Nights, and ofc kiss kiss bang bang. I Also liked the duo, they got very good chemistry.  This movie was fucking awesome and the billboard showing Tim Allen at The Comedy Store was a nice detail. Crowe's character reminded me of his character in LA Confidential. The hit man ""John Boy"" was pretty funny, he looked/acted like a mix between Don Draper and Ramsey Bolton, with the addition of a Richard Thomas hockey puck mole on his face.

After the movie was over, I realized that the giant mole was the only reason they called him John Boy, due to the popularity of Little House on the Prairie's popularity. Even ol' Blue Face called him John Boy. (Blue Face was a great character too and the what lead up to his death was classic.)

I gotta go watch this again. how refreshing is it to see a movie like this in the middle of all these giant superhero movies? THIS is what I wish summer movies were like. 

loved this one. it reminds of me of all the Hollywood action movies I grew up watching, like Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout etc etc. I hope this movie makes lots of money so Hollywood will start making more movies like this again. all hail Shane Black. Great fucking film.  Hilarious.


Holly MVP You wanna see my dick? They did such a good job of incapsulating 1970's L.A.

Killer Bees, pornography, arson, Nixon, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch of other stuff This is the type of stuff you hope for in a Shane Black film. Loved it.  Gosling going for the ankle gun was one of the funniest scenes from any movie in recent memory. Goddamn did it have me howling. I was so grateful the trailers left at least one good bit as a fucking surprise.  I literally couldn't stop laughing. The opening scene cracked me up way more than it should, and I basically lost it when March tried to punch through the glass and failed.

I had a very fun time with this movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it. What concerned me though was the lack of audience. IMO Neighbours 2 cannot be funnier than this movie, and it's a shame that such a great comic cannot get a full theatre on its opening night.

If you're on the fence about this, go see it. I was 3 hours ago, but dragged myself to it and do not regret it one bit. Was Misty driving the car completely naked? I almost thought that part was going to be revealed to be a dream sequence. 

Anyway, this was one of the funniest movies I've seen a long time. So many good lines (""Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just looking for my gun"") I loved it, Gosling was comedy gold in this and a great idiot, I want more from him like this.

The scene where he goes to break the back door and cuts himself was so simple yet beyond funny. Almost like a wink to every other movie that makes punching through glass look so easy & fool proof. The third act was by far the best closer in any movie I've seen recently. 

""You were on the roof, did you fall again?""

""Yes. I think I'm immortal..""  Gosling was a damn riot in this and Crowe killed it as well. Together, they made probably one of my favorite team ups I've seen in a while.  So stupid me didn't realize the Hollywood sign was actually in disrepair like that in the late 70s so I thought the movie was taking place in some alternate time line more crime ridden Los Angeles. Turns out the sign was just like that and LA really was violent.  I thought it was a stroke of genius that everything Crowe and Gosling did was, quite literally, for the birds. Couldn't save Amelia, couldn't put her mom away, but they did get those catalytic converters off the market, which, the activists claimed, were ""killing the birds"". Absolutely hilarious.  Really good movie. Gosling is a comedic revelation. Could be the start of an excellent detective duo. Would've liked more character development for Healy and Holland, they don't grow much or cause much change. But the whole enterprise is all in good fun. Throughout the entire movie I found myself thinking that Holly (Angourie Rice) was pretty much a carbon copy of Penny from Inspector Gadget. Constantly upstaging the adults while giving off a facade of being an innocent child-And not handled in an obnoxious manner either.

That really obscure thought aside, it's a great movie. Really took me back to the buddy cop movie genre which died a while back. They executed the 70's theme excellently and a good chunk of the theater was laughing constantly.  What a god damned movie. Was consistently laughing throughout the whole thing, and the story was original and fun. Hell of a flick.  Loved everything about it. It could've been a great 70s throwback gritty neo-noir movie even without the humor, or even the tight action scenes, but the witty writing and Ryan Gosling's (sometimes subtle) exceptional physical comedy (the man has such an incredible range, one of the best actors alive) and comedic timing elevate it to another level of awesomeness. Haven't seen The Revenant yet, but so far it's my movie of the year and best action comedy since the Jump Street movies, if not better. 

Also loved Russell Crowe's John Goodman thing that he had going on, and the girl that played Gosling's daughter was great too. So much fun.  Anyone else have theories on the significance of the Bees? Killer bees were mentioned, March hallucinates a bee and a bee showed up at the very end Great film, and I also thought there was something very interesting going on with march in terms of his relationship with his daughter. It seemed like he was absolutely terrified of her growing up and seeing a lot more of the evils of the world, like he said disdainfully when that arrogant kid offered to expose himself, or dealing with the pornography industry, or even that he was concerned with birds and bees (the colloquial phrase about budding sexuality) and possibly losing his daughter. Shane Black has done it again with terrifically nuanced, and flawed characters. I really didn't want to see this film based on the trailer. It was just too forced. And (spoiler alert) much of what is in the trailer appears in the first five minutes or so. It just ruined what should have been surprising jokes.

Once those were out of the way, this is a messy, fun, enjoyable movie that got several laugh out loud moments for me and I'm normally pretty picky.  Yes, we've seen the buddy movie before, and many of the standard things are there and yet they are not.

I once saw Shane Black speak and the one takeaway I remember is that a movie should be nothing more than setup and payoff, setup and payoff. It's great to see that Shane practices what he preaches.

There is all the quirky dialogue and plot points and fantastical elements that are earmarks of a Shane Black film and somehow he pays it all off. He gives the audience all the little throwaway information early and then loops back to the smallest of detail later that makes watching this so enjoyable.

Nice to see Gladiator and Gosling having fun. But the real scene stealer is Angourie Rice as Gosling's daughter. She more than holds her own and (in setup and payoff) gives the film a satisfying emotional payoff in the climatic scene.

I only hope that when the inevitable sequel comes along, it will be an honest attempt to make an enjoyable movie and won't be phoning it in like the Lethal Weapon sequels.

Go see it. Can't believe I haven't seen anyone here mention it yet, but when we're introduced to the mother I immediately thought of Chinatown and assumed she was the bad guy.

Great movie, favorite of this year. This film is everything I wanted Inherent Vice to be Was waiting the whole movie for something Christmas-related, finally got it at the end.  Holy shit when the blue face guy is hit by the van, I could not stop laughing. There were a ton of really funny bits in this movie that worked and Gosling can really pull off physical comedy.  Still, for all the buddy cop/detective/noir movie tropes that Kiss Kiss Bang Bang totally flipped on their heads, this movie seemed to come back to all of them in a totally unironic conventional way, all the way down to the ""frenemies band together and start a PI firm together"" happy ending (I mean, compare that to the ending of KKBB, which literally apologizes for its cliches in a way that totally subverts them while being hilarious).  It felt like a movie that didn't realize KKBB, a movie that covers all the same ground in a smarter and more self aware way, already existed, which would be more tolerable if it weren't written and directed by the same guy.  Overall I liked it and laughed a lot but I expected more given the gold Shane gave us before.

LOVED Ryan Gosling gradually shaking like a terrified dog more and more as the elevator went down.  And the ""ankle gun""/cold coffee scene was hilarious. I would love to see Ryan Gosling get nominated for this. He is a really good actor and stuff. The whole movie was meta as fuck. I'm pretty sure the whole ""someone else will just take care of Detroit"" scene was put in solely to make the movie even more meta: a statement about Detroit hidden in a movie about a porno that does the exact same thing. Loved it! My favorite thing about this movie is the comedy that comes out of nowhere. So may hilarious things happen that are just out of the blue.

I lost it during the Nixon scene. I just wasn't expecting it.
 Fucking Chet... I noticed that there was one tiny historical inaccuracy. In the scene where Amelia is laying down in March's room there are two posters next to his bed. One is ""Nevermind the Bullocks"", which makes sense (released in 1977), the other is a poster of the album cover ""London Calling"" which actually wasn't released until late 1979. Although the poster doesn't include the title ""London Calling"", the picture of the bassist was taken in September of 1979... and the movie takes place in 1978. Just thought I'd throw that out there. I loved the movie though! Fantastic! As a huge fan of noir, I LOVED Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. This seemed like that but in the 70's so I was sold. It definitely delivered! I love Shane Black's style of ""Here is how the scene is an how it would play out in a normal cookie cutter film. How would it play out if the characters were incompetent?"" That made for some truly hilarious scenarios(ie. half of Gosling's situations) This is probably my favorite film of the year with Green Room. [deleted] It really annoys me that people aren't seeing this movie. Then they want to complain about there npt being any good movies out that aren't Marvel.  Super funny. Chemistry between the two was great. I wished they didn't show that many of the jokes in the trailer though. This movie felt more or less like the film Inherent Vice wanted to be. A ""Big Sleep"" set in the hippie era with memorably off-the-wall characters. IV had more inventive and interesting cinematography, but NG had a miles better story and characters. 

I pretty much loved this movie. It was just a lot of fun.

It also felt like a writer at the peak of his powers. It's important to note this is not Aaron Sorkin or David Mamet, but Shane Black. I don't mention that as a sleight - they're just different writers. Aaron Sorkin at the peak of his powers will write about some grand or epic topic, like a US President or the invention of Facebook. Mamet will create a taut (and occasionally boring and bland) thriller. Shane Black is gonna have a lot of fun, give you crazy twists and turns, and memorable characters with memorable dialogue. You never get the sense in this movie that he's being lazy and making things easy. When March goes over the balcony and finds the dead body, it seems convenient, but really its Shane Black going, ""He needs to stumble upon a dead body, which is a genre trope I want to see here, but it has to happen in a way that works with both the character and bizarre tone of this story.""

My local movie theater is a bunch of money-gauging motherfuckers, but I was glad to spend the money on this movie. I may have missed this, but why was Amelia's film so important? I know she was trying to expose her mom, but why would a teenage girls porn film be considered trustworthy whatsoever? I found that part of the mystery a little far fetched If Val Kilmer had showed up as Gay Perry's dad this would have been an impossibly great movie.

That being said, it's a great goddamn movie. I thought it was great. I thought the chemistry between Healy and Holland was great and Holly really blew me away, she was great.  
  
I really like the tone Black set from the beginning of the film especially when the kid covered Misty Mountains chest when he saw her die. Just came back from watching this movie, enjoyed the movie immensely. Why? First of all it actually felt like the 70s, and it was a parody slash realistic portrayal of the decade. Second of all, Ryan and Russell have the best chemistry I have seen in a long time. I don't know how to explain it, they just fit well and actually felt like they were having real conversations. Third of all, I never got bored and there was a chuckle every minute or so. I loved dead pool, but felt the movie had a joke every 5 seconds and they were trying to make it funny to much. This movie did add comedy to a lot of moments but not just through dialogue but also physical comedy. It's just fun to watch.  I greatly enjoyed it, but WHY OH WHY would both Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe fall for Yaya's ""Hey help me move all this money"" after they JUST heard Amelia say her mom and staff are crooked?? I feel like this is The Big Lebowski of this decade.  ""Why are you wet?""


""I was interviewing the mermaids""  I loved the duck drawing on the cast. I'm thinking that was a callback to The Long Kiss Goodnight [phallic duck drawing](http://imgur.com/KXCLTio)? Did anyone else notice any other Shayne Black references to his older stuff? Spotify Soundtrack Playlist for those who want it--
https://open.spotify.com/user/sirantonius1/playlist/7z6IHbZthCCzoQIZKjy1Je
spotify:user:sirantonius1:playlist:7z6IHbZthCCzoQIZKjy1Je Holly was just fantastic, she played off of Gosling and Crowe so well I have been waiting for this movie for so long. I can't wait to go see it. I don't care about anything besides this one for the time being  Fucking Chet Man I near pissed myself after he punched the glass!! The build up was perfect! rewraps his hand and steadied his arm then...

Having seen the after effects in real life I truly appreciated the humour and the accuracy lol [removed] [deleted] OK- One thing that bugged me was Holly's bedroom posters. The Clash poster was from London Calling, which came out in late 1979. She also has a Sex Pistols poster, but Never Mind the Bollocks came out in October 1977, but wasn't released in the US until later (they only signed with a US label in October). Nitpicky, but it still bothered me.  Genuinely a fun movie,  I enjoyed it a lot. I absolutely loved it, though the ending did feel very similar to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Not really a bad thing. I only caught Tim Allen's name on the Comedy Store signs, who else was on there? [deleted] [deleted] It's been a while since I've seen a movie that is able to handle both hilarious comedy and good action. 

That whole projection room scene was absolute gold too, when he didn't realize she was in on it, and the ankle gun scene. I laughed a lot more during the movie than I thought I would.  This is a total dad movie. See it with your dad like I did, it's the proper way to enjoy it.  how do you like my car, big boy ;-) Absolutly loved the fact that there wasn't a standard 

""oh this movie is set in the 70s? Back then, Cocaine was everywhere!"" scene.

Such tired and lazy writing - really applaud them for not including it.  I loved the film. The scene were he was like I dont think I can die, I may be invincible was straight up hilarious.  So did nobody care about death and murders in the 70s?? So many people died in this movie haha. I gotta say, I didn't like it. I had just watched the trailer and it seems like a classic case of all the funny moments given away.

The bee scene was great though, and the acting was great, but a lot of the humor was lost on me -- and I laugh at everything. I didn't like this movie as much as the rest of you, I thought the humor didn't really fit in well with the tone of the other scenes of the movie, which kind of took me out of it more when I should be laughing. I ended up wanting to love it more than I actually did, Ryan Gosling was amazing though, and some of the humor sections were genuinely great, the crowd I saw it with wasn't getting into it very much though which may have clouded my view. Out of all the movies this week, The Nice Guys is definitely my favorite. 

I went in watching the first trailer, so mostly blind in terms of plot and who was involved outside of the big two and had an absolute blast. 
Gosling and Crowe had such amazing chemistry together. The plot was over the top, in a good way, and not terrible hard to follow. 

The little girl also did a fantastic job holding her own. Which is great, since her previous role was the terrible [Walking With Dinosaurs](http://gorgview.com/walking-with-dinosaurs) film. 
 
This is the movie to watch this week. If you want to read my full review, you can [see it here!](http://gorgview.com/the-nice-guys) :) 
 I can only wish that one day my non-existent daughter will be half as badass as Holly. I had high expectations for this movie and it exceeded them and then some! It was super funny and had great action to boot as well as the best use of an under aged dick joke I've ever seen Very funny, there were some very strange pacing/editing choices for me but overall a very solid film. One of my favorite of 2016. Loved loved loved it. The chemistry between Gosling and Crowe was off the chart. Also loved the daughter too. The 70's vibe was so amazingly put to screen as well. Certainly need to see it again as soon as possible. 

*also, seeing a little girl get thrown out a window just was so....funny yet so wrong.  Really fun movie. I thought it had just the right amount of physical humor. The only thing that fell flat for me was the ""Thanks buddy."" ""How'd you know my name was Buddy?"" joke.  Official Hitler Joke Count: 4 Ryan gosling speaking German is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. The shit made me laugh like hell. And the whole falling from balcony scenes.  Can someone tell me what happened in the first 20 minutes?

I mistakenely went into the wrong auditorium, and didn't find out for a while (Was in someone elses seat :( embarassing tbh). Amazing movie, but I don't think it'll gross that much, which is a shame. We need movies like this. Just saw it finally. huge huge shane black fan and I was entirely satisfied. Definitely felt very KKBB but with a lot more Last Boy Scout than I ever expected.  I haven't enjoyed the background of a movie so much in years. Stuff like billboards for Jaws 2 and Airport 77 tied it to the time period really well. Shane Black should direct a Grand Theft Auto movie. Best movie of 2016 so far Just saw it on release day here in Australia, what a genuinely funny movie. Few movies can keep you laughing through the entire runtime! Overall I thought The Nice Guys was a good film but it didn't quite do it for me, it was enjoyable,

- but it took too long to build
- it couldn't find the tone it wanted to be
- The mystery didn't quite really pan out

But boy the chemistry of the three leads was great and really pulls you though some of the films rougher edges.

[Full review](https://tldrmoviereviewsblog.wordpress.com/2016/05/27/movie-review-the-nice-guys/) That yell Gosling let out lol pretty funny shit.  I really hate how the writers felt the need to incorporate the daughter in every scene. Her insisting not to kill the people that were just shooting at them is ridiculous as well as her sneaking her way into every scene of the film. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie and thought it was smart and hilarious but it could've been so much better and way less corny without her in 90% of the movie.  Quite possibly my favorite film of the year so far! Shane Balch hits it out if the park with yet another great noir style pulp crime film. The chemistry alone oozes off the screen between Gosling and Crowe. Right from the initial retro title card, I was enthralled in the film and was not let down at all. When  I thought about it post credits, the only thing I really thought could have improved would be Matt Bomer's rather bland antagonist? But by Odin's Beard was the film and 70s LA GLORIOUS! Terrific soundtrack, style, and overall vibe to the whole film.  

I certainly paid $20 to see this and didn't get ripped off by Nixon showing up! 

[Quickee Film Review](http://quickee-film-time.tumblr.com/post/144635144366/at-least-nobody-got-hurt-well-i-mean-they-died) Damn good movie..... and stuff  It was perfect. I had totally forgotten that the ankle gun was from the dream sequence, so I was just thinking that March was a fumbling idiot and Healy was playing it cool so she didn't find the gun. Then he says ""Wait did I dream that"" and I busted out laughing. God this movie was hilarious. That was a fucking fantastic misdirect on a chekhov's gun.  The was my favorite part of the movie. I haven't laughed that hard in a very long time ""Wait, did I dream that? Fuck, I did didn't I?"" That fucking giant bee, man. I just lost it. I thought the same when you see Crowe leave his knuckle duster behind on his TV, as he leaves his apartment. You think that's going to matter, but he decides to just beat up Gosling anyway. The actual Chekhov's gun was that in that same shot you see him turn out the power of the apartment, rather than turn off lights and the TV etc, which lets him distract the two goons when he comes back later. Some very nifty writing! ""This one takes the fuckin cake"" killed me.  ""Wait, did I dream that!?"" > Gosling was looking for Crowe's ankle gun.

The best scene of the movie. And that Bee scene too... [removed] Nixon was the part that had me howling the loudest. Great film.  The black secretary?  Gosling had a thing for the not-a-murderer-I-mean-deep-down hot chick though. But yet a fully realized female role.
Goddam that 13 year old can act.
Love how it was a daughter character instead of a love interest. The dude literally slapstick-comedied his way to catch a bad guy at the end of the movie. He just kept falling and bouncing off things until a car literally launched him at his assailant. It was fucking marvelous. ""I'm invincible. I don't think I can die."" followed by a sequence of him stumbling, falling through a glass ceiling and getting hit by a car. I nearly spit out my drink when he punched the window and split his arm 😂 I was laughing hysterically with the revolving platform and car bit. Fortunately there was no one else in the cinema.  It's really human too. I can totally imagine me in a high stress situation chucking a gun out the window Hahaha.  I knew it was coming. As soon as I saw the cars I said to myself that joke would be done. 

It didn't keep me from laughin my ass off.  I loved that about the movie. Invested a good amount into March's drinking and how it affected his work and his relationship with his daughter, and pointed out that Healy doesn't drink, only to have the happy ending being them drinking together. A+ I was expecting ""The Unforgiven"" style scene where Russell starts drinking at the beginning of the third act and you think ""awwww shit's about to go down"". Took me by compete surprise when he does it at the end of the movie. Genius writing.  ""Yeah, I feel great."" 

Fantastic dialogue throughout.  Yeah, I wondered about that. Do you think that he was a recovering alcoholic, and fell off the wagon due to the influence of his alcoholic buddy March? One real nice touch was in her bedroom she had a bunch of Nancy Drew books on her shelves. I love how Aliyah, or the DOJ Assistant/Assassin, knew it was Holly pretending to be room service. ""You can come on in, Holly."" ""Real clever, Holly"" So condescendingly hilarious.  Watch The Last Boy Scout, another Shane Black penned but Tony Scott helmed ""buddy cop"" movie with Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans. Similar set up but decidedly a bigger action movie. Still, it has the same use of a PI's daughter throughout.  Speaking of the scumbag assassin. Matt Bomer's haircut was awful. Such a waste of a perfect face. While I really liked the movie, I have to disagree on this point. The actress was totally fine, but I felt like the character was constantly out of place and the film just ignored that fact entirely. Her gathering information at the party was cringeworthy to me, for example, and her casual attitude towards the action around here felt kind of dumb to me.

Again, liked the movie a lot overall so this is really just a nitpick, but it's the one thing that stood out to me as being bad, personally. ""Really big turnout"" The bit about nothing stopping Detroit nearly killed me. No one else got it :( Would you care to explain this to a non-American? I thought that Gosling's response there was very Llewyn Davis. This reminds me of Kiss Kiss Bang.

""She's been fucked more times than she's had hot meals.""

""Mmmm, I heard about that. It was neck and neck until she skipped lunch."" What was he doing? He was squealing almost silently and thumping his chest and chopping his hand through the air. Was that just how he freaked out? Don't say ""and stuff"" just say ""Dad, there are whores here"".

Parenting done right That scene got the biggest laugh from the audience I was with, myself included, loved it!  I have only seen 3 of Shane Black movies but his ""discovering the corpse"" scenes are always the most memorable moments in film for me.

If anyone is curious I'm talking about Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with RDJ. > There's nothing I can say about this movie that will stand out from the rest of these comments

You could say you didn't like it.  Seriously though, glad to see all the positive reviews.  Did you think it was better than Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang? ""Do you wanna see my dick?  It's big..."" ""Young lady. She was a porno *young lady*.""  >""That was mostly Holly, his daughter""  
""It's genetics""  

>""The Vegas mob is trying to spread its porn operation to Hollywood Boulevard, and I'm doing everything I can to stop it.""  
""Thank you. Porn is bad.""  

So many hilarious lines in this movie It's not a porno it's an experimental art film! Best line of the movie, easily  I kind of saw it coming, but the way it happened and how quick it happened caught me off guard. Looking back at it now, definitely made it feel more real. Did you run to the bathroom or something? She was annoying as hell I'm glad she died. I despite people like her, just listen for once you dumb broad! To be honest I kind of liked that. A lot of innocent people died and the bad guys won/walked away in the end. Just like real life, not everything has to have a happy ending. That's what she gets for not being careful and running out of protection. Don't say ""and stuff."" Reminded me a lot of Chloe Moretz in Kick Ass, really good young actress who's going places That girl is going to be the next big thing. She was quite the little scene stealer. I couldn't pinpoint where I'd seen her but she plays the little girl in *These Final Hours*, which was very imperfect but ultimately really enjoyable. It's on Netflix if you've got an hour and a half. > It’s like the TV’s on, talking about the new power plant, hmm, wonder where the climax will happen?

Which is funny, considering the first time we've seen the auto show is on tv in the first few scenes... One thing that I noticed after leaving the theater: The smog over LA that was in all of the shots of the city early in the movie. > It’s like the TV’s on, talking about the new power plant, hmm, wonder where the climax will happen?

Like the Auto Show being announced on TV at the beginning of the film and that's where the climax happens? Man, I love Shane Black's writing.  I also loved the scene where he says ""Thanks buddy,"" and the guy responds ""How did you know my name is Buddy?"" Perhaps I looked too far into it but I sort of saw that as being symbolic of R.G.'s character being so damn lucky all the time. Also their reactions when those moments of luck happened... I'm gonna need to watch it again but yeah, I'm 98% sure March solved the case entirely by accident, and through sheer dumb luck. Kinda like Indiana Jones being inconsequential in his own movie. I'd say it's a combination of The Other Guys and The Big Lebowski I think the Nice Guys would make a great double bill with PTA's Inherent Vice. Something tells me Doc Sportello and Holland March would really get along well together. Ok, I had this Big Lebowski impression  (with dramatic action scenes a lot like pulp fiction) for half of the movie, so I tried to rationalize it after. Of course it just added another layer of fun to the Nice Guys:

- The film starts with drama (peeing on rug/car crash)

- We got team of two with additional third one (Lebowski+Walter,Donny/ Jackson+Holland,Holly)

- Similiar names of Donny and Holly 

- Russel Crowe looks like John Goodman!!!

- Chilled, not so bright one (Lebowski/Holland)

- Sometimes violent, big, confident about himself (Jackson/Walter)

- Marginalized friend/child (Donny/Holly)

- Swapping the money in a bag

- porn industry :)

- ""artistic experiment"" that involves sexuality (vaginal art/porn for attention)

- Killer trying to waste the characters (nihilists/John Boy)

- Complicated intrique that generally is solved, but it doesn't matter anyways

...Some of them just had to be on purpose
 I DIDNT USE HIS NAME IN VAIN, *JANET.*

I ACTUALLY FOUND IT PRETTY USEFUL, *JANET.* ""Janet!""  JANET!!  I walked out knowing I'd be watching this movie many, many times in the years to come.  [deleted] I was indeed on the fence. People told me it'd be shit Yeah, the trailers really don't do it justice. It'll make you heave with laughter. The story itself is kinda meh, second act in particular, but it's still easily one of the most enjoyable movies released so far this year.

But yeah, marketing stunk for it. I loved the Hitler jokes. ""I think I'm invincible. Like I don't think I can die."" Gosling falling off the balcony was probably the funniest bit in the movie There was a bit at the end where Ryan Gosling is holding a cigarette next to the very flammable film stock. I was waiting for it to inevitably set on fire but it just cut to the next scene. Because God doesn't like good movies.  Audience expectations. Standards are lower for Angry Birds - lots of parents are just looking for something their kids would like (or their kids dragged them to it), so 'meh' or 'perfectly serviceable' get rated pretty high. I loved this movie. Laughed throughout along with the rest of the audience in the theater where I saw it.

But.......  The trailers might be a bit misleading.  Some of the people who gave it low Cinemascores might have been expecting a ""Funny, ha ha"" kind of buddy cop movie and not one where there is a dying naked porn star in the first minute and 12-year old kids talking about anal sex and showing you their dick.

I hope this movie finds its audience because it's funny but a lot of people might be deeply offended if they don't know what they're walking into. Don't say ""and stuff"", honey. I really liked The Nice Guys, but I disagree.  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang had much tighter editing. ""Equanimity...he accepted her betrayal with equanimity.""

""Dammit Jack I'm fucking your dad.""

""Wha...what?"" Your* I loved how so many extras were shot by those errant bullets and never acknowledged. 

""No one got hurt.""

""A few people got hurt, I think.""  Poor Janet. I just know that on the commentary we will find out just how hard he had to fight to keep that scene. Harming kids is big no-no for the MPAA. If you shoot a child, it's an automatic NC-17 (used to be X). And before you name an example that refutes this, go back and watch it very carefully - it might have been *implied* but you almost never see the actual bullet hit. On the commentary for ***Assault on Precinct 13*** John Carpenter talks about how just a year later and they would have given it an X-Rating for the scene of Kim Richards getting shot through the ice cream cone.  I really thought they were gonna delve into what going back to ""Michigan"" meant. Ah well.  OH SHIT I knew he looked familiar, he was in Palo Alto > Also did anyone else think the 'Blue Face' henchman really looked like Sasha Baron Cohen? 

I definitely thought it was him for a second 

 I thought he looked like Ben Stiller. Yeah, she is As a leftovers fan as well, I really liked that actress that played Jill's performance in this. She was way different than a brooding depressed teenager and pretty funny ""I believe he was comparing you to Hitler"" best line in the movie, and something Michael Scott could've said *wink* ""What do you call a guy with no balls?""

""Married?""

I lost it at that answer! You see it one or two more times throughout (whenever he has an open shirt on), but you're right, they never make a big thing out of it. Great visual storytelling. ""She's that porno actress, yeah?""

""Porno *young lady.*""

One of the many great lines from Gosling. Another good one was at the party:

""You went in the pool?!""

""I had to question the mermaids! What were *you* doing when I was working?!"" I actually had a strong feeling Gosling was gonna die at the end. After he got the film and flashed the pinky promise to his daughter.  Amelia did die though. Didn't see that one coming. Was there any significance in that besides ""Hey we all know Tim Allen, he was just getting started then""? Is he good friends with Shane Black or something? that and the Jaws 2 poster did it for me The Waltons, not Little House on the Prairie. You should be ashamed. 
>due to the popularity of Little House on the Prairie's popularity
 i got a rapey vibe from blue face. The fact that Crowe didn't use ""Good night, John Boy"" as a one-liner when knocking him out at the end makes me angry. Sadly it only made 11.2M this weekend, which placed it 4th behind a sequel, a superhero movie and a video game adaptation. > middle of all these giant superhero movies? T

You do realize that the only reason Black was allowed to make this film is because ***Iron Man 3*** was a mega hit, right?  there's a reason for that. shane black is listed as a writer on all of the lethal weapon movies. She's Australian as well. Great accent. Surprising high number of talented kid actors this year. That usually is the nail in the coffin for a movie but she was terrific.  She was the young girl in 'These Final Hours'; the trailer of which was pretty popular here on /r/movies a few years back. I already gave you twenty bucks  everyone is a drunk, stoned perverted degenerate. One of the reviews called it ""the most Shane Black movie Shane Black has ever done."" Don't get me wrong, this movie was great. But fuck those trailers. They showed off a bunch of the funniest parts of the movie imo.  I was like him, I forgot the ankle holster was shown in a dream sequence. > Was Misty driving the car completely naked? 

She had a thin robe on and that was pretty much it. Crowe...Gosling....birds.....

Just sayin' I think you've got that backwards- they got them on the market, right? That's the whole point of catalytic converters to filter the exhaust?  At least Healy starts drinking again at the end. That's some level of growth.  I'm actually okay with the lack of growth. Like, I didn't *need* them to go anywhere throughout the story. I just sorta liked learning about them as we went along. Russell Crowe isn't the scary hardass he's introduced to be, Gosling isn't a suave, well, Ryan Gosling type.  
  
I enjoyed picking up the bits and pieces of info they dropped about themselves as the film went on, and finding out who they were as opposed to really fixing anything about themselves. It felt different than most comedies because it took itself more seriously, and I thought that was a good move for it. I think it was about how distracted we are from the real issues. Like everyone in the 70s was worried about killer bees but we should have gave a shit about the horrific smog and pollution at the time. Well they are introduced three time I think? Firstly at the Earth Wind and Fire concert party in the hills, as Holl is getting a drink. ""You know what they say about killer bees? They kill"". 

Secondly, when Holl is dreaming behind the wheel, under the influence of alcohol. 

And thirdly, at the very end, on the bar table as the duo drink to their somewhat success. 

You could argue that it is tied to the theme of the alcoholism that Holl predominantly has (even though they're both alcoholics). Everytime Holl gets drunk, the killer bee is there to sting him and remind him of reality. i think the theme of this movie is the stubbornness of old polluting industries and their unwillingness to change? Bees are going massively into extinction as a result of pollution, and are a symbol for victims of climate change. Once the killer bees were killing human beings, now they are threatened with extinction. 
The last scene is a subtle joke, at least in my interpretation, when Gossling, after the whole struggle to get the tape to get that lady in jail, tries to kill a bee.  Birds and the bees. Woah. Never thought about that but so obvious now. Great catch! Had almost the exact opposite reaction. Seeing Inherent Vice again recently (and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, actually) really weakened this film in my eyes. The detective plot here was incredibly slight and pedestrian and when you take away the jokes there's almost nothing to chew on. Yes. THANK YOU!  Are you listening, PTA?? I am going to downvote you because Inherent Vice was exactly it should have been. I have watched it 15 times now and still it's fucking hilarious!  -guy in van opens door
-HOLY SHIT!!
-slams door and speeds away

This moment had me rolling for a minute straight.  The grown man sitting next to me audibly shrieked and hid behind his hands for the rest of the scene. It was weird and turned my outburst of laughter into a nervous church giggle.  > It felt like a movie that didn't realize KKBB, a movie that covers all the same ground in a smarter and more self aware way, already existed, which would be more tolerable if it weren't written and directed by the same guy

Possibly because that's exactly what happened. According to Black, The Nice Guys script actually pre-dates KKBB's. Nice Guys has more in common with Last Boy Scout. I loved the ending. Cliches are good when they're executed well. But the thing is, they were never enemies. That's one of the great bits about the script, both are just guys who are doing shitty things on their own with this tired resignation, and then when they start working together they realize that while they'll never be ""good"" guys, they can be at least nice.  Don't say ""and stuff"" just say ""He is a really good actor"" I didn't get the Detroit reference, can you explain it to me? At least *he* didn't die. I just wrote the same thing. I don't think the Sex Pistols were released in the US until 1978.

edit: I thought the move was set in 1977?  Also at one point you could see a poster for Airport 77 and Jaws 2 even though those two films came out a year apart I loved when Ryan Gosling and Keith David jump off the roof.  Then Keith David splatters on the ground and Gosling lands in the pool. give them some time it hasn't even been out for 48 hours yet. That is my same sentiment. Most of the funny bits were included in all the trailers so unfortunately I was already spoiled the great moments. Solid movie though. Will definitely go see again. Had almost the exact opposite reaction regarding the Inherent Vice comparison. I saw that movie again recently (and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, actually) and it really weakened this film in my eyes. The detective plot here was incredibly slight and pedestrian, if you've seen a handful of detective films you'll be able to see around every corner here. Every character that seems like they're hiding something, is hiding something. Nothing is surprising. Inherent Vice actually has a lot on its mind and is actually an effective genre deconstruction. But with The Nice Guys, take away the jokes and there's almost nothing to chew on, it feels really disposable. 

And Vice actually transports you to the era in which it's set. The Nice Guys feels really cosmetic in comparison. From her point of view, everything she does is important.  It's far fetched but so is everything else that comes out of Amelia's mouth. I saw her as a typical young hippie who thinks everything they do is important or noteworthy Yeah I kinda agree. I wished the whole tape was shown so we actually got a sense how incriminating the 'art film' was.  Val's son Jack played the projectionist kid, if you didn't know.  Downey does the same thing to a corpse in kiss kiss, bang bang.  Interesting.   [deleted] That did happen a little too suddenly. I expected Gosling to fall for it, and Crowe to not.  http://i.imgur.com/9H6XytL.gif I could see it. Lots of fun, very quotable, silly and serious at the same time. I'll definitely be grabbing this one on bluray in the future. I honestly had the opposite reaction. I thought the film started off really rough and gradually got better and better as it went along. She was secretly a time traveler, but they had to cut that scene for pacing reasons Buress is actually in all three new releases this week. He's in Angry Birds as well. That was one of the best part (against it being a usual Black trope you can point out): I rather see a smart kid character put in a movie rather then one that just nags along, annoys the ever living shit out of you, and is only there to cause mayhem. She actually HELPED them progress the investigation, and she was still useful when needed to be. But I'm glad you loved it like I did.  The direct's goal was to subvert tropes and this was a great one.  The coffee bit afterwards was also a nice add-on. Especially when immediately afterwards Ryan Gosling compliments his daughter on her thought process. Voiced by Hannibal Burress no less and that bee was HANNIBAL BURESS Definitely, the payoff for many of the jokes were really well done I think.  Nice catch, i completely missed that.  saw it with my friend and i figured it out and told him we both laughed hard

 also this movie is only 14+ in canada The timing and nuance of his physical comedy in that scene was pretty damned impressive.   yes. Oh god, the moment I saw Yaya Dacosta's name on the screen I had a love interest Yeah, but it made sense for his character, I think This was one of the few times I've seen a good, actual teenager take a good role of a teenager, and it was very refreshing. Speaking of which, I love when blue face got hit by a car and you think it's Russell Crowe, but it was just some random guy who drives away I loved how all of that happened *after* he basically called himself out for having plot armor. 
 >slapstick-comedied

I loved the Three Stooges bit when he found Hatrack's dead body. Although I do like the fact that the 3 thus ranges from manic incompetent (Blue Face), Professional (Older Guy) to utter cool under pressure (John Boy).  John Boy quickly came up with a distracting plan by throwing grenade under a  show car to clear the auto show to calmly trying to get the film reel.  We also never got their real name.  I mean, why would a paid thug say their name to potential witness? He wasnt on the job then. Any Johnny Gossamer? ""Why did you throw cold coffee on my Holly?"" And she was another foul mouthed young girl in a very foul mouthed movie. Kinda a Shane Black thing, and I love him for it since I love both of these movies. i really liked how they handled the daughter and thought she was a great addition every time she was on screen I think I was the only one in my theater to understand the line about asparagus. I agree! I felt like I laughed way more than most of the audience I was sitting with did.  I smirked the entire way through, but to be fair, the only thing that stopped Detroit was Detroit  What is it a reference to? Yeah you're so smart. As a guy from Europe, please explain me the joke. I didn't get it, would you kindly explain? I loved how she faced the camera when she delivered that line, like she was breaking the 4th wall. It was brilliant.  Was this a reference to how the city is in the shitter now and the auto industry over there broke down completely?  So, Detroit is known in America for being an extremely corrupt, violent city. It's also where a ton of of the biggest American car manufacturers used to be located, which is why people keep talking about it in the movie. 

Judith Kuttner, the head of the Justice Department, at the end of the film, says that, ""Detroit killed my daughter."" which she meant as a metaphor, as if the corruption and overall seedy nature of the city finally caught up to her and killed Amelia. 

But March took what she said literally and made a joke, saying that the entire city came together for a vote and decided on killing Amelia themselves, which would be ridiculous.  It was a classic Lou Costello slapstick gag. [deleted] A bit late to the discussion, by I couldn't hold the laughter at that scene. He was so scared he couldn't scream... man, laughs were had. I really liked The Nice Guys, but I wouldn't say it's as good as KKBB. It's a little looser, the jokes aren't quite as good, the characters aren't quite as well-formed. Still a really good movie, but KKBB is Shane Black's masterpiece. The main thing I included in my quickee review that separates me from the massive applause of the film would be that I didn't fully like Matt Bomer's John Boy. I thought he was rather bland and at best serviceable. I mention in the review that his time was indeed cut, shared between Keith David and Beau Knapp, but I was expecting much more off the rails. 

[Quickee Film Review](http://quickee-film-time.tumblr.com/post/144635144366/at-least-nobody-got-hurt-well-i-mean-they-died) Well there's nothing I could say to praise this movie that hasn't been said already.*

And unfortunately, I haven't seen Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, but I'll definitely be looking for that movie soon. The Nice Guys has attracted me to Black's directing.  I saw KKBB yesterday cause I was planning to go see Nice Guys today. They are really similar and both have their own flaws but I preferred Nice Guys. It's equally funny but KKBB tried to introduce too many characters that just appear on screen to die. Nice guys is better on that aspect. Also the duo Gosling/Crowe has better chemistry. ""I'll show you my dick for $20""  
""I already gave you $20!"" This scene honestly had me in tears. 

So bummed this didn't do better at the box office. Awfully done by WB.  ""Don't say 'and stuff'. Just say they were doing anal."" It was honestly so refreshing to just see her die like that.  Like, after all the stupid decisions she made, she finally made the wrong choice one too many times and paid the price.

In a lot of movies, an essential character can choose wrong over and over again, but never get punished for it so it was great to see it play out like it did. It was foreshadowed by the Richard Nixon/Angel story Russell Crowe tells a little earlier, I thought.  She was looking for an angel in a desperate time, instead she got her version of Ol' Tricky Dick. Just ask, ""Did you run to the bathroom"". Thanks dad. Just say they were doing anal Yeah the whole setup of the auto show / pollution scandal was a bit obvious Was Buddy the guy driving the black van? I kinda feel like the van driver looked a bit like him. Aim for the bushes?  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Man From UNCLE were my assumed similarities Fucking Janet... She locked herself in there first. what people fuck them I thought the marketing was FANTASTIC. The trailer really got the tone of the movie down as well as sold it as a buddy cop comedy.  I loved it towards the end when he was talking like a Nazi by Basinger. Did I miss something? Because Gosling kept making Nazi jokes throughout the movie, and it felt like he was setting up for a really big one at the end, but that just kinda went nowhere? You know who else was following orders? Hitler.  I saw that as a great plot armor joke.  I legitimately thought he was going to die at the end when he got the film cannister and was slow walking around. Game of Thrones has seriously skewed my plot view in everything... Reminds me of Archer when he says almost the exact same thing about his plot armor. They stopped using nitrocellulose film in the 50s; the new film is flammable, but not nearly as quick to burn up.  KKBB was cool but I preferred Nice Guys. I think my problem with KKBB was the villains. Like they show up one scene then die. And you don't give a shit cause you didn't have the time to care for them in the first place. Nice guys villains have more developed characters, you have blue face, michigan and the serious one. I also feel Nice Guys duo had a better chemistry. The way he said ""What?"" did it for me Jessica. The one you like. I think it was pointing back to Keith David's character working for the Detroit auto people, the same who sent Johnboy to kill Amelia.  So that *was* Jill! I thought it looked like her. She acted sufficiently different to confuse me though. And her makeup was different as well.

Also, good to see another Leftovers fan around. There is too few of us. ""You know, Hitler only had one ball."" So speaking of the visual story telling. Mrs. March died when their house burned down caused by a gas leak. Maybe the gas was ignited by Hollands smoking? He wakes up fully clothed and submerged in the bathtub when we're first introduced to him. He passes out on his diving board over a cigarette littered pool. Maybe he's terrified he'll pass out and cause another fire and lose Holly too? The first time Ryan falls off the balcony, he tells him that he was in the pool. Second time he falls, he ACTUALLY falls in a pool Pinky promise. But kinky promise probably fits the film's motif So glad it was a pinky promise instead of a kinky one. I thought he was going to die as well given the specific mention that film reel is very flammable, and the movie ends with him holding the film reel to his chest, lighting a cigarette, and placing it near his body, and then saying ""sometimes you just win"" as if they're going to go through with a ironic death by killing him in a moment. it was more for accuracy, if you notice the dates the movie takes place and match them up, all the names are who did play at the comedy store on those days He was also from Detroit. Not sure if that played any part though. You mean to tell me those were two different shows? TIL. I heard Gosling liking the script also played a big part in that Also, Iron man 3 was friggn awesome.

Also, superhero films have had a GREAT couple of years (especially since 2008). Age of Ultron, Civil War, Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-man 1 and 2 (in my opinion), Ant-man, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Dark Knight, The Wolverine, Deadpool, X-men: Days of Future Past, etc.

Superhero films are just another genre, like crime movies. It wasn't too long ago that westerns and gangster films were considered ""low culture"" before the new vanguard of film critics recognized the art in the projects. And Last Boy Scout writer on the first one, think he is just listed as the creator or ""based on the characters created by"" or something. 

He wrote a version of LW2 but it never got made and they tore it apart. He was talking about it on Doug Loves Movies the other week.

He did write the Last Boy Scout though Holy shit.  I really hope she gets more after this because she's a really good child actress. Wow, she was Australian, her american accent was perfect I thought the big dick kid was pretty bad, until he delivered the big dick line. He did that pretty well. > 'These Final Hours

I had never heard of this movie before your comment. Just watched the trailer. Is Jacki Weaver in this? I thought I heard her distinctive voice in the trailer but didn't see her in the cast list on IMDB.

Edit: Just watched it on Netflix. Nope--not Jacki Weaver, but James' mom actress sounded **exactly** like her, both the accent and tone of her voice. Wait why am I even saying this? Not enough Christmas though. I'm trying to imagine what their attempt at stashing that corpse would have been like if it hadn't been spoiled.  Plus it was revealed that she was murdered so she might have been forced in the car or drugged or something. I thought it was odd that she wasn't wearing pants or anything at first.  my favorite part.
''at least you're drinking again!'' They can't answer. They're dead.

What do you mean they're dead? Aren't the gas mask supposed to protect them or something? Also, near the beginning there was a newspaper with the front page warning of Brazilian Killer Bees. He was reading a newspaper about Killer Bees in the beginning as well. I think he's too busy making films that will actually stick with you. The Nice Guys was fun but felt really disposable, which is not something I'd ever say about Inherent Vice. ehh that's a little harsh. PTA's movies and Black's movies are very different even tho they may seem similar. I think Inherent Vice was pretty funny and true to Pynchon's novel.  He wrote it in 2003, a year before he wrote KKBB. The joke was that Detroit has really really gone downhill since the 70's. The character was way off, no one else took care of Detroit. The car show they go to had signs that said 1978  As I said in another comment, I want to say that the movie does this on purpose.

To Amelia, the whole catalytic converter issue with the automakers is a very black and white issue.

Considering that one of the main themes is the relativity of morality, I think it's very possible that the circumstances surrounding automobile issue were relative.

Her thought process is probably something like:
`catalytic converter breaks rules -> environment damage -> bad`

In reality, the reality might be a little more grey.  We never see the actual evidence that was gathered against the Big Three, plus you have to remember that Detroit's main industry is the automobile industry.  By crushing the industry with the iron fist of the Justice Department, the local economy might have never recovered.  That's also why Amelia's mom was talking about saving the Detroit she loved. *projectionalist Also, Gosling clearly blinded by his infatuation with Yaya (and also very drunk) would believe anything she said. Even after they realize its not really full of money, he still thinks that someone else switched the briefcase. I think I""ll be looking for someone to see it in theaters again with. Here's hoping for a director's cut The real reason she was hanging out in the field was that she was waiting for the TARDIS to pick her up. Damn. Make that money.  He's been all over the last few months. Plus he's one of the primary reasons (if not THE primary) that the Cosby thing blew up again. Which is funny because this reminded me of a similar scene in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with a hidden gun...=P Hannibal Buress' voice just barges into the scene so abruptly calling him an idiot that I looked around in the theater thinking he was actually there and heckling the movie out loud. A dream sequence with a cigarette smoking bee voiced by Hannibal Burress is just so damn good. I somehow love this movie even more. I'm just saying she was a love interest  For a guy that jumped into water tank for mermaids.  Definitely made sense.  You see the black van again, when they are taking a taxi home.  Then you think they're going to get out and help.


**door opens* *

""Oh shit!""

**door closes, car drives away* *

This movie caught me off guard so many times, it was impressive. ""Oh Shit!""   ✌🏻🚌💨💨 Doesn't he say ""Oh shit"" and just peels off?  It's even more hilarious that he was ***literally*** shielded by the film. ""I think I'm invincible. It's the only explanation.""  Three Stooges? Lou Costello is rolling in his grave. The bit in the bathroom stall is some of the best physical comedy I've seen since early Jim Carrey.  Upvotes too, for shame..

Here is a scene of Costello doing it in [Meet Frankenstein](https://youtu.be/l6NIVn6_m1c?t=136) John Boy was amazing. I'd love to see more of him. He's like The Transporter but evil and stuff.  That's how I took it. He'll drink when he's not working, but thought the film we see him on the job. That line fucking killed me cause it was just a throw-away background line  Care to explain? I looked over to my wife to see if she got it. It took her a second but that was one of many subtle dry jokes that I loved from this movie. What was the line? I dont remember hearing it To Detroit now Detroit basically ruined itself. The Big Three thought they were untouchable. Now Detroit has filed for bankruptcy and the Big Three aren't close to the same companies they once were.  She said that nothing can stop Detroit and the Big Three. IRL, Detroit and the Big Three very nearly killed themselves and had to be saved (other than Ford) by the government that they were controlling in the movie. Being from Michigan, it hit close to home. Yes! I think it was more of a sarcastic comment in response to her statement. He was basically saying that she was talking a load of rubbish. Absolutely.

https://youtu.be/l6NIVn6_m1c?t=2m15s
 Yes!  I'm glad someone else saw that.  I was literally slack jawed during that scene.  I love Abbott & Costello and that choice made me love this movie so much more.   Oh ok, thanks Agreed 100%. I have kind of a hard time not comparing it to KKBB, which is unfair because KKBB is so exactly and specifically up my alley that anything else that deviates isn't going to be as good to me. Still, Nice Guys was great, and I'd highly recommend it. ""Wait what am I saying"" Wait what am I saying? The hilarious part is that March *constantly* did exactly that throughout the whole movie. He kept making ridiculous mistakes and somehow survived. ""Sometimes you just win."" Great film with a lot more layers than meet the eye. That wasn't even a stupid decision! Getting the hell out of the house while a gunfight is going on and flagging down the first car you see isn't a bad idea! How was she to know the gunfight ended with the guy driving away in the exact direction she'd run? Yeah, for a character who was actually trying to help (as goofy as her cause was) she really was a dumb character. Almost infuriating. Wow, good eye on that. I didn't even make that connection. I thought it just demonstrated how stupid she was. She was basically just down the road from where the shooting was, and it was a dead end, who would be coming from that direction that wasn't March or Healy? Any time I'm feeling bad I'm just going to hit up /u/lonesomerhodes. 

""Hey, these mean people said my script was contrived.""

what people fuck them Yeah that first trailer killed and showed just enough of some of the best bits.  ""What is he doing?"" 
""I believe he is comparing you to Adolph Hitler.""

Best joke in the movie. I laughed the loudest in my theater, but then again Hitler Jokes are my kryptonite  He kept making the jokes wrong, like saying Hitler followed orders. I don't think it was a big setup, it was just an amusing character trait. One of my only problems with the movie was the plot armour, but then he goes and says that. I couldn't help but smile. Same here but I've never watched Game of Thrones. It was calm, and even tempered!  *splash* lol I know it was a joke but honestly that was such a realistic interaction between a father and child, with them not remembering which friend is which.  I think it's also left implied that they live in such a nice place because of insurance money? Holly mentioned something about they're ""not even supposed to be here."" Damn. Great observation. I didn't put that together. Just got out of a second viewing, and your theory holds up pretty damn well. Holly even mentions that Holland (Holly and Holland, godammit, how did I miss that before?) couldn't smell the gas because of the injury he mentions to Healy earlier. I think it's pretty obvious you got it spot on there. Ho. Ly. Shit. Good fucking eye. I also noted that he never finishes his cigarettes, when we see the bottom of the pool they're all barely smoked. I think he's trying to quit because of the fire but can't fully give them up. I like this theory a lot. It's not a ridiculous stretch like those insufferable ""fan theories"" you see on Reddit a lot. It completely makes sense as well as makes sense that the writers would have done it intentionally. He was in the pool the first time too. Chasing after mermaids.  What with the rimjob/rimshot moment Iron man 3 was a joke of a movie.It was Shane Black taking the piss on the source and bending everything as he deemed fit. Wikipedia doesn't even know her birth date, so she's definitely young. She did a great job. 

Also did anyone notice the kid in the beginning was the kid from Iron Man 3?  The last scene was during Christmas. I think Let It Snow was playing in the background  That was honestly my favorite part of the trailer haha Until you realize she was a Porn Star. Ah yes, and then he is immediately distracted by a commotion and cuts himself shaving. Wake up call. Yep upon waking up with a hangover, fully suited up in a filled bath tub. He then proceeds to get distracted Ted behind the wheel and cut himself shaving his 5 o'clock shadow. This whole movie reminded me of KKBB, and that's a good thing! Why'd you call it a faggot gun? Sounds like a skit from The Eric Andre Show. Pretty sure that was just more flirting. There was really no connection between them. And the hood is dented. Loved that. This scene is the one that put me in a fit of uncontrollable laughter Literal plot armor. Bravo Shane Black. That was totally Lou Costello. When he first started I was like, oh. That's Lou Costello. I didn't think I would laugh. But it kept going and gave me a loud laugh.  Reminded me a bit of Kramer (Michael Richards) as well. Don't say and stuff Supposedly, it effects the taste of a certain fluid. I don't remember it exactly, but something like ""If you keep on eating asparagus, I won't do it."" and stuff.  ""And I said, 'If you want me to do that you shouldn't feed me asparagus"" Mmm... I still don't get it Oh that makes sense. That is pretty funny thanks. He was invincible.  Said it himself.  God damn amazing lines Ryan had.  I disagree. I'd bank on the two guys hired to protect than run out into the open. Very dumb idea. Very much like Kevin Kline in A Fish Called Wanda Huh, I totally didn't pick up on that. My bad. you went and saw a buddy cop movie and had issues with plot armor? what did you expect Was it just me, or did the part where he walks out and all the bullets miss him not in the movie? 

Let me try and find the video.  

I might not be able to link it cause I'm mobile : 
https://youtu.be/MxW4LZCYfvs

Also, I may have been sipping on my drink so I missed it.  And then the film literally saves him from a bullet ""That worked out."" To be fair, when all of them are screaming in a crowd at the bowling alley, the faces sort of blur together. The house was just a rental though  It's also alluded to when Healy first goes inside Hollands house and says ""a PI can afford a place like this?"" Okay, I respectfully disagree. I thought it was a brilliant look at the themes of identity, perception, and misdirection. All of those themes, which I thought was perfect for the Mandarin it was a genuine surprise in Iron Man 3. And Jurassic world IM3: Which Shane Black also directed. Me too, then I googled the director's name and apparently he did that movie as well as his first movie!  Frik, I missed that!!
 Hahaha. I can't believe I used ""and stuff"" while talking about that movie. I'd like to say it was a joke setup but nope. I took it as a hint to golden showers because it makes your pee smell bad. Don't say ""and stuff"" ;) I think it's that no one in the film would have expected the Detroit motor industry giants to crash like it did in real life. Two guys with pistols she hadn't even hired against the maniac with a submachine gun? ""JESUS CHRIST!""

""*gasp* YOU USED THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN!""

""I didn't, I actually found it very useful."" Yeah no the insurance thing doesn't hold weight, they're living in ""a place like this"" because it's a rental—as they tell us halfway through the movie. Not only that, but it was the last piece in Tony Stark's character development. It was a perfect end for him... But Marvel had to bring him back for more movies which made his ending and getting rid of the suits look dumb and almost pointless. I wasn't going to respond, but then I noticed your comment is only 13 days old.  But really, if you're calling that a love interest, his character had about 10 love interests in the party scene. Frik? makes it taste bad too....or so they say They were good enough to not get hit *and* protect the other girls. So, yeah, staying in the house was the best idea. They're living in a nice rental right next to where their old place was to rebuild it. They can afford the nice rental because of the insurance money. It's Mormon for ""Fuck"". No it wasn't. Amelie just saw Jonboy exterminate an entire hotel suits wort of guys ...the insurance money that was never mentioned in the movie?

You guys are overcomplicating it when it doesn't need to be Damn dude. This was like 3 months ago. 

I'm still right tho. Girl got deaded. No, just trying to explain something that was left unexplained. Just for the sake of keeping this old thread goin': Nah, you're wrong. ",0
165,"I liked it. Made me go home listening to Golden Slumbers. It's not innovative,  but it's entertaining.


WHAT THE FUCK was that bull farting and shitting himself tho.  A solid 7/10-8/10 flick depending on your interest in music and singing. Plot was predictable but hey I wasn't expecting anything hugely different. Definitely worth the time to watch, I had fun Here are my thoughts on this movie. Please feel free to add your own thoughts. I like discussion. Additionally, this will be mostly spoiler free. 

I thought the trailers gave out most of the punchlines, which weren't very funny after the first time - if at all. They also, unfortunately, gave out a lot of the scenes where we would feel compelled to care but don't end up caring at all (or even as much as we should) because we saw it in the trailers anyway. The last half hour or so was better than the beginning, in my opinion, with a nice range of music in different genres that I enjoyed listening to. Because of the widespread amount of stakes with the varying characters, I felt like nothing was really at stake, especially since a lot of the problems ""resolved"" themselves. I saw resolved in quotes because I don't feel they really did resolve the characters' issues. I did end up enjoying it more than I thought. 

MINOR SPOILERS: Lastly, damn! Buster's happy cheery face as he stole water and power from the city cracked me up. Especially in the beginning where he nearly injured countless people with his bike riding!  The J-pop red pandas were great. I'd give the movie a 6/10. Fun, great music, no real depth, but a good popcorn flick. Gotta say, this movie pulled some heavy mood whiplash out when I least expected it. I was starting to get bored up to that point. It was brutal and completely unexpected for this movie. From the trailer alone, I was expecting just basically a 90-minute concert in Zootopia's Theatre District from some actors and a bit of life drama I already knew the end to. Oh, she IS good. Oh, the dad loves him. Thanks trailer. Instead, I left with feels. Imagine if they ended it right there. Would've rivaled Toy Story 3.

I liked Ash's original song and Harambe's final songs the best. So glad he didn't stay with ~~Won't Back D~~Stay With Me my god I hate that song. All Of Me would've been *ok* too but the one they went with was the best, I think it was Elton John.

Can anyone with a better ear for it tell me if Melodyne was used here for the singers? The voices seemed so natural and I didn't hear many artifacts (I heard some on Tori's) but I'm not too familiar with how natural-sounding melodyne can make them. But some of it seemed too good to be true.

Also I think it's safe to say that after this movie, Rosita the pig went on to become the new Iron Man with that contraption she built overnight. I more impressed that some of the voice actors were really good at singing those songs. The car wash scene was the funniest thing I've seen in a while. Otherwise Meh. A pretty boring film. Outside of the songs there was not much of a story. I enjoyed it. I didn't get more or less than what the trailer promised me, and I'm ok with that. Yes, the plot was predictable and a lot of the big moments were spoiled, but it was a fun movie either way. I laughed quite a bit and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get wrapped up in the songs. It was light-hearted, not ground-breaking, but still enjoyable.  I went in with low expectations and enjoyed this. I'm honestly surprised at some of the reactions here. It was certainly better than The Secret Life of Pets, it has characters I actually cared about and moments I could enjoy. I don't usually like musical numbers in movies but these were great. 

Definitely laughed out loud at the car wash scene.
 I watched this movie few weeks ago and I thought it was one of the better movies from Ilumination.

I like that most of the cast has singing experience in some ways. The first and second part in this movie is kinda generic in the executions but the last 30 minutes were very good.

I think it is a good alternative if you want to take your family and looking for a good animated movie besides Moana.

Overall, if you like animated movie, talking animals, and pop music, then this movie is for you.


**7 out of 10** from me That pig lady was thicc af Hated Mike as a character and was waiting the whole movie for someone To finally knock him out or give him what he deserves. Didn't really like how they portrayed the dad pig as some incompetent parent and made it seem like he just straight up ignores his family yet he's providing for 25 damn children and how the wife just seems disappointed he fell asleep after working all day never really considering the dude is working his ass off... the kids go to school all day long or so it seems so .... they make the bears seem like the nad guys but you would be pissed to if someone stole your money and didn't pay you back ... then for Mike to claim the koalas money was his and then when they open it he has the audacity to say "" you lied to us "" he needed his teeth knocked out .. I do like the movie as a whole but certain things were like wtf ...  my favorite character was johnny and Meena  This movie was better than it had any right to be. The brief synopsis would be 'Animated animal version of Idol' but there wasn't as much as I was expecting/hoping for, especially since from my understanding it was singing from the actual voice actors.

Also, some of the things that happened were so absurdly crazy that it was borderline kind of awesome. The car wash scene was nuts, the contraption that the pig mother created was so absurd, the fact that the Bear gangsters way of killing was to actually eat the mouse, McConaughey sing-talking to Call Me Maybe, etc. I enjoyed it. As a guilty pleasure mostly. I mean yeah it was predictable story schlock. But I always wanted to hear Seth do My Way. The father son scene at the end actually got me tearing up. Maybe cause it seemed genuine instead of phoned in. The animators did a great job too better than Life of Pets but not as Good as Zootopia, but I enjoyed it more than Zootopia. Like I said guilty pleasure I liked it cause it's the kind of cheesey movie I needed and haven't seen in a long time. It goes for safe choices and yes there is a fart joke, but thankfully only one Question: Does anyone know what the Japanese was that he was getting out of the dictionary when he was talking to the little J-pop group? 

So I feel like I'm contributing, my opinion was that the movie was cute but every single major plot point was spoiled by the trailer. Which I would've avoided watching in advance except that it came on while I was in the theater for another movie, so I was basically a captive audience. I don't want to spoil anything but I'll just say how I felt. This movie seemed to be dull like Secret Life Of Pets but I was surprised as the movie went on. There was a lot more songs than I assumed they were going to use which added to the mood/tone. The animation was very colorful and bright and for the most part, the characters had some sort of back story/development. Everything towards the end did start to speed up and wrap up nicely which was great. Overall it was a positive movie that if you enjoy animation/songs should have you leaving the theater happy.  Disclaimer: I'm a sucker for animated films. On the flip side, I usually don't like things to heavy on music. With that said...

I really liked this film. It's definitely in my top 3 for animated films this year. Some characters were more cliche that others, but that comes with the territory of kid-focused movies. The characters felt real with their concerns and desires. I was rooting for all of them, and there was definitely a big payoff in the final concert. 

As I always recommended, see all animated films in 3D.  I really liked the movie, and the struggle felt very real to me, as an aspiring artist. I cried like a kid who dropped his ice cream, and I haven't, to this day, ever cried watching a movie. It was really good.
I just want to know one thing: What does Mr Moon tell the Foxes? I understood half of his broken japanese, and he probably said something perverted or rude, but I couldn't quite get it. Can someone please tell me? Google is not helping me. Why is this a film? Most kids' movies use music in order to avoid having plot. Albeit predictable, this movie had some thick plot. I'll complain a bit about all the autotune, every character except Mike (Seth McFarlane) had noticeable autotune whenever they sang. Just a little peeve for me really. Matthew McCaunaghey should be ashamed of himself. His performance here was *GREAT* whereas he just phoned it in for Kubo. Based on that, I expected a horrible voice performance from him and it ended up amazing me. Above all that, the fantastic climax really put this movie at 9/10 I watched the movie with my sisters and I had my laughs. Incoming somewhat ending spoiler:

[What happen to Mike at the end of the movie? I know he escapes but he still had the bear tagged along the vehicle. Did I miss something or was there something after the credits?](#spoiler)

Thanks. I was expecting the movie to be songfest. The problem with movie is [The singing part is only in the first and last part of the movie](#spoiler). I'm so disappointed by this. The trailer is basically the movie. It was so catchy and gave me new music to listen to i loved it all the way through! 

The movies version of hallelujah gave me chills and being a bit older i didn't get annoyed by the parts that were silly fun for everyone! I enjoyed it. I thought it was cute and endearing. I liked the movie. It wasn't great or groundbreaking, but it wasn't terrible either. It's a family movie.

My one gripe, though, has to be Ash's boyfriend. In the cafe, he's playing his left-handed guitar left-handed. When he gets home, however, he's playing his guitar right-handed. And the tuning keys are configured for a right-handed guitar! Are we supposed to believe that this guy (or porcupine) is ambidextrous? And he has two guitars that look exactly the same, except that one is left-handed and the other is right-handed!? The red foxes say :

""We are so happy to be in this show""

""We will sing for you again"" A solid **6/10** from me. It's not going to get anything higher, but it's not going down either. The entire plot of the movie can be glanced in the trailers (which seem to be the trend nowadays), and it doesn't take any sort of initiative to venture away from its predictability. 

However, being predictable in this case means there's no immediately discernable upset in its plot that takes our attention away from its various musical scores that, to be perfectly honest, was the only reason why I was there. 

The elements of drama is there for people who like that sort of thing (like myself). While there is no visible effort made to stand out, each of the subplots are introduced, escalate, and wrap up as nicely as you would expect from its visuals. 

All in all, it's a lovely gift for everyone who loves a happy story where everyone's number one value is in forgiveness and understanding.  Best part of the movie is the songs To be honest, for me I didn't have any interest in seeing this, but I had the choice to either see this or Assasin's Creed, so I chose Sing.

I went into this with low expectations and as a way to pass time, and towards the climax of the film (when Meena started her song,) I was mentally wondering when the movie would end.

Most, if not all the characters were cookie cutter and bland, which I can't really blame because it's multiple characters with their own goals and arcs, but I can't say it did the film any favors either. I think I was more interested in Rosita and Gunter. Heavily disliked Mike (we first see him harassing and mugging an athsmatic monkey...) and Mr. Moon (he didn't work to get that theatre, his father did, and I can't say that he's a good owner of the theatre either, with the theatre in the dumps and him not paying his hardworking stage hands. He even gets someone else to pay for his previous troubles. I don't know why we keep seeing unlikeable characters being portrayed as likes me with sad back stories. I don't think it does them justice). Meena was meh, Ash was meeeeh, Johnny was cute and it was nice to see a gentle gorilla (although the filmmakers should have probably not gone with the ""apes committing crime,"" route, because now they're facing a bit of backlash, but I'm black and didn't really care too much after observing the issue).

Story was heavy but mixed up, both running into and leaning on cliches. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but again, nothing too impressive. Just meh? 

If you're looking for something new in the songs, then don't really expect much. I think I only heard two or three songs that were new, and it was Johhny, Ash, and Meena's songs. Everything else was something I heard of before or was just popular not too long ago, or was Frank Sinatra and stood out too much.

Like Secret Life of Pers, the character and setting designs compared to other animated features was a bit lackluster and unimaginative. I felt like it gave the movie a dull and generic atmosphere.


All in all I give it a simple 5/10. Don't regret seeing it, just the fact that I saw it in theaters. I might forget it after a while, and I don't think I'd want to watch it again. Anyone know the song used during the Squid Scene? Gladly appreciated, thanks! just saw it, I really liked it. I was entertained through the whole thing. I really liked Johnny's (the gorilla) storyline with his dad, even though it was predictable how it would turn out. Him singing Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"" was an awesome performance too. why do i want to bang that gorilla  What a terrible movie. I understand it's for kids but all the characters expect maybe the gorilla and the mom pig were awful. The rat is basically evil; self centered, cheater, shallow.  The koala is similarly terrible; consistently does illegal/immoral things, also self centered. I don't get why would anyone be rooting for these people?  All the funny bits were in the trailer. I don't think i laughed once during this movie. Again, i know it's kids movie but there were far better animated movies this year with better messages for kids.   Saw this today and found it absolutely lovely. A great heartwarming movie with a stellar cast , good music and cracking gags. Loved that the director is one of the main characters too :-). In fact the cast list is full of surprises! Wes Anderson?? Edgar wright??? Amazing.  Btw. WAY better than secret life of pets. On a par with zootopia. Zootopia is a crime thriller though so a completely different sort of movie.  Really hated this movie. 

I just preface this with the fact that I haven't really liked most of Illumination's pictures but this is by far my least favorite of theirs. 

I found myself not laughing at almost anything in the entire movie (except the car wash scene). Every funny thing in the movie was shown in the trailer and having seen the trailer before just about every movie since January, I was really tired of those jokes going into it. I left the movie legitimately confused how I was so bored in such an over-the-top colorful movie!

The music choices ranged from the flowery poppy stuff that fit perfectly in the movie to slow songs like McFarlane singing Sinatra's 'My Way' that really didn't fit and had other stuff happening while it was sung presumably to keep kids interested.

One last point, that I felt was more like a nitpick at this point is just how unlikeable I found the Koala. I think most of it stems from him talking about how hard his dad worked to buy him the theater, then seeming embarrassed when he had to actually work at the car wash himself, but it all worked out for him because he found someone else to buy him the theater again. Just kinda got on my nerves... 

#4/10 Anyone know who was the voice singer of Ash?(porcupine)? Or was it really Scarlet Johansson? The critcs really like this for some reason can somebody help me understand  [This film is literally the devil.](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/sing-review-matthew-mcconaughey-illumination-1201728515/) I only enjoyed those japanese bears, i want the sequel to this movie to feature them more! KYARY PAMYU PAMYU's SONGS are fun to listen to. Meh Great movie! I thoroughly enjoyed all parts of it! Anyone know what song was playing when the koala's friend was swimming in the pool and the koala scared him? What did the red pandas say when they thought they were accepted into the competition? Did anyone else catch the John C. Reilly Boogie Nights reference??? Hi reddit, I think Ash, the porcupine, might be a neo-nazi. You want proof? At around the 1:26:00 mark, Ash ties her shoelaces montage-style. Her shoes are jump boots with white laces, and it's tied the right way to make her choice of apparel a fashion staple of nazi-skinheads and other rightwing nationalists (at least in western europe). This would make Ash either a skinhead or a nipster, depending on when the movie is set. Please tell me I'm wrong. Why were they animals? eh/10

Dr Strange rotated out earlier than my group anticipated (this was weeks ago) and we settled with Sing since Rogue One is out of the question. 

Very linear, you can already tell what the next scene would be most of the time. If you like musicals this won't be too bad, that is if you absolutely adore singing, 2 of my friends enjoyed it a lot, it is not a coincidence that they're both fans of musicals. 

I won't call it bad, there aren't moments where I out right groaned at for being bad. There are moments where I giggled from childish jokes, and one particular moment where I nearly bruised my ribs from laughing. Silly jokes are great if you are a parent looking for a film to watch with your kids, this one has loads. Do the three female rabbits have names? For some reason I'm starting to really like these characters. This Movies TRASH! First of are they sing f u C k in the auditions? Second the father pig aka put us dads in a bad light like we dont do anything! That woman has 12 kids come on dad do something!!! Then is the mouse who yells at a monkey for giving him a tip... Where is the humor in harrasing him for more money? Then he cheats and gambles ...why would i root for that dick! Pls dont go see it in the cinemas...just wait till it comes out free in good quality on the net....who made this shit 2/10 [SONG NAME NEEDED] Was wondering if anyone knew the name of the song playing when Mike pulls up with his new car? Hip-hop track. Damn.  Never knew she could sing.  That's cool. I've read that Adam Buxton voiced 'Stan'. I've just come out of the film now, about know who Stan was? Just curious Question: Can anyone name the song from Ash's 5 sec guitar solo when Meena came into the theater as a stage hand? The song is right on the tip of my tongue but my brain keeps playing Final Countdown by Europe over and over. It's not listed in the credits and Shazam didn't catch it either. 😖 needs more Amber Riley Does anyone know the name of the song that plays immediately, right after ""Firework"" during the audition scene? Does anyone know what is Mike's car brand and model?  I commend the trailer being accurate to the film. But I couldn't help but be reminded by Zootopia, which is far superior. This film would have been better if they reduced the music used in the film, because whether or not I liked the song they used it was really distracting. so glad i avoided this one,looks like this is going to be the next norm of the north/food fight. Kids love farts. Plain and simple.  I think it's because buffalos fart a lot. Kinda like cows and how they are associated with methane. I laughed when the bull farted, it was so unexpected  8/10 for a predictable plot movie about singing pigs. Boy have our standards gone down.
 > because we saw it in the trailers anyway

I felt like we saw 3 different stories in the trailer; Porcupine moves past ex-boyfriend, Elephant overcomes fear, and Gorilla overcomes dissapointed crime Dad (who ultimately is proud for his son by the end).

Is that essentially the entire movie or does it have something else? Heh! Heh! Sounds like Buster (Seth MacFarlane, if you're not up to date) to me!

I totally see how he can ruffle up the more ""traditional"" members of the audience with his wild-edsque behavior that verges on the nearly scandalous, but ANYONE can see that his love for the theater, for performance, for life, and for making a difference is SECOND to none. > pandas

I want to know that song's title. I was thinking they were tanookis, might have to look it up. My question is why are the CHINESE red pandas portrayed as JAPANESE? Are the cultures that interchangeable? I expected Meena  to sing Sia in the end :( >Harambe's final song

Nice I was honestly waiting to see a credit at the end for Johnny's singing voice but it was just Taron. He's making it hard for me not to love him I'd argue there were too many stories going on instead of just focusing on one or two key ones. I'm all for an ensemble film, but you can't have seven main characters all fighting for something so different in this short of a time frame, it feels too forced and becomes a bore. Agreed. I though it would be like pitch perfect 1 more singing less story.  > I don't usually like musical numbers in movies but these were great.  

I think part of what made this was that a lot of the music wasn't like, singing storyline to us and was in-universe appropriate Just a small note... I am sure Rosita also worked her butt off to take care of the 25 kids and also her husband plus keep the house all tidy. Yet -although she was clearly worn out- she still could smile and be there for her husband. If she can do it, so could he but he was dead to the world and chose to stay so. Work doesnt need to make you to a zombie, you know. Only if you let it. Sorry, had to say this... so many people ignore all this when talking about Norman and Rosita.  I'm on mobile so this could be better but-

Mike added great little small nuance to the movie. First - the mouse had great pipes. You see appreciation for it from various characters throughout the movie. Second - he clearly only cared about himself. Even the girl mouse was just a feather in his cap (likely why they didn't explore her). His jerkiness let the writers add in conflict, add a little color/controversy and then setup a great ending scene. 

My favorite part of Mike is while he is all about himself - he truly seems to love music. He lives the classics, but loves modern music with a good beat. You see both sides juxtaposed together when Meena gets on stage for her first time. When she knocks the stand over - Mike pulls out his jerk side, scoffs and walks off. When Meena starts to sing - Mike is flabbergasted! His appreciation for Meena's voice really pegs her as the best singer of the group. For the first time Mike sees past himself and enjoys the music of one of his fellow performers.

I'm hoping it was a redeeming moment for Mike.

Gunter is still my favorite character though. So spicy! It seems pretty clear that Mike got eaten by the bear in the end. I'm so upset that the mouse never got what was up and coming to him. He literally was a complete jerk to everyone, and then... he drives away at the end - plus got his spotlight on stage. Its cynical, but I was really hoping to see him get what was coming to him. I just saw it. From what I can remember from my rusty japanese, he basically said they all smelled like shit. > Does anyone know what the Japanese was that he was getting out of the dictionary when he was talking to the little J-pop group? 

He said ""You are very stinky."" and then something like ""I look forward to seeing you stink."" The jpop group was spelling out a word and my kids swear it was FUCK. What were they actually saying? Just curious, what was your top 3 for animated last year? I heard he tried to say ""You guys are good. You guys are in the show."", but he instead said something like ""You guys stink. Your footwork is horrible."" **[Some time ago]**

-Quick, name a movie made by someone else that is going to be popular in a couple months!

-Hm, Zootopia?

-Perfect! Take one of those dusted old scripts and make it with anthropomorphic animals Ah, I was just wondering about that. Can you tell me why you believe autotune was used on their voices? I feel like they wanted to give an explanation, like maybe Mike and his girlfriend drive back to the theater and have the bear get the crap beaten out of him, scaring them off for good, but he just kinda disappears.... An epilogue for all the characters would have been really nice. They entered the contest to show off their talents. I assume they all get gigs at the Theater and preform in acts and such (including Mike) then becoming huge successes on their own.

Just a lot of glossed over that shouldn't have been. THIS! I mean... The way they left it, I'm pretty much assuming he got eaten. I sat through the whole credits because I was expecting a final cutscene, but... Nothing. What I thought was interesting about that final scene with Mike is that I think it's a reference to Back to the Future II (when Marty is trying to take the almanac from Biff's car). Normally I'd write it off as a coincidence, but being that Ash's performance was clearly a Back to the Future reference, it might be what they were going for. I agree, thought there would be more of the American Idol-esque competition showed, wanted more singing by the contestants  Are we supposed to believe that its a magic guitar? Boy I hope someone got fired for that blunder. What did Mike say in Japanese to them? Also they weren't foxes. The moment they started singing in japanese, I knew exactly what they were: Tanukis aka Japanese Racoon Dogs. Well, I feel that they did show the plot in the trailers is because there isn't really anything different they could do with that plot. They knew what they had, they knew there wasn't really any point trying to pretend it's such a secret, so why not just let it out there. It's not like this is Batman v Superman revealing the surprise bad guy at the end of the movie. It's just a fun, simple family film. It better go up. I understand the backlash with the apes, but I feel like they did a decent job trying to avoid the racial implications.  The Cockney-ish accents, while a bit cliche, were very obvious and the actors for the father and son are both white Brits.  If anything, I'd think Brits would be more sensitive to it considering it plays more into the cliche lower-class Cockney criminal thing than it does race.  The elephants were more stereotypically ""black"" and were played by black American actors. Better avoid those people that hates 'sing' because of the apes committing crime cause those guys are definitely racist. Flashing Lights by Kanye West Superstar- Lupe Fiasco  I enjoyed it as a more mature film then as a kids movie. Each character had a flaw and a problem that they needed to overcome. While this is predictable and you already know how its going to end, i enjoyed the way each character handled their issues.

The gorilla was more worried about making his father proud then his own talent. He wanted the best of both worlds and tried to please his father and ended up getting him arrested. His father disowns him, and so he he wants to win his fathers love back. At the end, he goes to steal the chest to bail his father out, but sees the note that he is a gifted singer and decides that his own talent means more to him, and he devotes all 100% to his performance. 

The mouse was a narcissistic and selfish jackass. He was greedy and a con man. Hes pretty self explanatory honestly. He is motivated by money, by lust, and greed. He ends up deciding that since there is no prize money he wont perform because its a waste of time. Then after seeing everyone praise the mom pig, he decides the music is worth more then money. He even gets the girl.

The mom pig has low self esteem, a husband that doesnt really pay attention to her and 25 kids who need constant attention. She eventually learns to find confidence, ends up earning her kids respect and getting her husbands attention back. 

The porcupine is in an abusive relationship with a twat who keeps putting her down. She realizes that she is talented so much then her boyfriend is, and uses the pain to write a song that earns everyones respect, including her ex. Also through the auditions the koala tries to get her to dress like a girl, sing preppy pop music and change who she is. She also earns his respect and plays a crazy good song she wrote.

The elephant is self explanatory. Low self esteem, and ends up finding courage to sing and break through her shell. The mouse also looks down on everyone who auditioned, but salutes her and breaks out in tears at her singing.

The male pig who worked with the mom, he was just support to help her break through her shell and also comedic relief.

The koala was a narcissistic ego maniac who was hell bent on making money. He ends up lying and cheating his way to make his plan work and ends up crushing himself in the process. He realizes that what matters most is heart and the strength to get up and try. Also very self explanatory, not really a need to go into detail on him. 

Nana was bitter and lost hope in the world, especially in theater, her love is restored by the singing contest.

Overall i enjoyed the movie a lot. I just want to know did the mouse get killed in the end. I kind of wish there was more closure, maybe ended with the whole cast recreating the play from the opening scene. 

I give it a 7/10 I honesty didn't find Buster all that bad. It would be pretty boring if all main characters we squeaky clean saints. I found him a bit narcissistic towards the beginning, but he mellowed out towards the middle of the film, letting Ash do her own thing and giving Meena a second chance. That's what makes the movie so good. All of them had potential and talent but each of them had something holding them back. For the mouse it was his ego. Notice he was REALLY good, maybe even one of the best as far as vocals but the problem was he knew it. The movie showed what each of the characters had to work through if they wanted to go further in life. I especially love the scene where the monkey in the beginning gives Mike a pennie and he bullies him into giving him more money. Then, he goes on to sing Frank Sinatra's ""Pennies from Heaven"". It highlights how he fails to connect emotionally and spiritually with his music and basically just uses his gift to serve his own ego.  yeah I just could not stand the movie as we had to follow Buster who clearly sucked at his job, trying to force everyone to do what they dont want, cant understand why they would help him in the end, worst part was that his ideas wherent even good. As a songbird and theater kid, I can say that it probably just appealed to performer types more, people into the arts  on a technical standpoint, i think this movie was superior, the lighning, reflections, textures, everything was a step higher from zootopia, i guess disney gets the awards because its disney.  My dislike of the Koala stemmed from the beginning of the film when he stiffs his stage hands from the previous production. Hard to consider him anything but disrespectful and irresponsible after that.  It was indeed ScarJo It was Scarlett Johansson, she made a band with Este Haim. Y[ou can hear it here.](https://soundcloud.com/federalprismrecs/candy).

 They didn't really like it, they just thought it was decent. Which it is. right now, the critics tend to be super kind to non-traditional fare like musicals.  Had to stop reading that right at this line:  "" He talks too much, while the scantily clad female mouse for whom he thirsts doesn’t have a single line of dialogue (a sexist oversight that at least spares some poor actress from the indignity of having to voice the character).""

The movie has a ton of female characters.  In fact, this author criticizes the movie for having too many characters total.  But god forbid the writers use silence as a rhetorical device to show the absurdity of many crushes.  God forbid they do that, because by having one character be silent that totally means they're sexist. > When Buster’s secretary (an ancient green iguana voiced by Jennings himself) accidentally drops her glass eye on the boss’ keyboard, the resulting typo sees the prize money spike from $1,000 to $100,000. The next morning, every animal in town is lined up on the sidewalk. It’s greed that first brings everyone together.

When he interpreted *I'm interested in fairly competing in this harmless singing contest, especially because of the big cash prize!* as a repulsive show of greed, I rolled my eyes and almost closed the page. Most reviews of music / televisions / movies are way too flowery and pretentious, and not stuff I usually bother to read.

But I went further and ended up really enjoying it. He was incredibly hard on this thing and way up his own ass, but there were some hilarious bits:

> (Mike, the mouse voiced by Seth MacFarlane) talks too much, while the scantily clad female mouse for whom he thirsts doesn’t have a single line of dialogue (a sexist oversight that at least spares some poor actress from the indignity of having to voice the character).

> So hear this: “Sing” is a film that’s designed to placate children rather than enrich or inspire them. Illumination’s target audience may be too young to know how awful their latest movie is, but they’ll never watch it when they grow older, they’ll never cherish it as a source of nostalgia. They’ll simply grow up expecting less of the movies, less of the world around them, and less of themselves. No big deal.

> And hey, some of these characters are cute! And it’s fun to hear famous people sing. So what if the koala is running a carwash! It’s just a cartoon. Relax. That herky-jerky Laika stuff seems kinda weird, don’t you think? What the hell is a “Kubo,” anyway? “How the Grinch Stole Christmas?” Now those are words I’ve heard, in that order, before! “Despicable Me 3?” Sounds like an afternoon I won’t have to hire a babysitter. “The Secret Life of Pets 2?” What is that dog still not telling us?

Lost it, lol.

Thanks for posting this, man. I never would I have seen it otherwise. Less of a review, and more of a rant, but I don't think it's wrong. At the same time, I can't blame Illumination for setting achievable targets and hitting them.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjZG9MiELio I think you are overthinking it Not defending the movie, but you could ask the same of Regular Show. Basically, it really doesn't matter what species (or thing) the characters are. Found the furry. lol this guy
 It was L U C K. She had 24 kids
 See, I thought they sang ""F u c k"" in the audition scene too. That bad, huh? Why such the low rating? Million Bucks ft Swizz Beatz I think he was the original getaway driving gorilla Was he the camel?  Eruption You should try asking in r/namethatsong Distracted by what? It's about the songs. The story's 2nd. Not even close. It's no Pixar film, but it does its job an entertaining you for an hour and a half. As good as The Secret Life of Pets or Madagascar. Nah it's alright. Me and my little bro enjoyed it kids love farts, farts are funny, and it was unexpected. All the little kids in my theater were giggling  Dude, it's just his opinion. Why don't you just go off to your safe space if you can't handle people having different opinions.  Are forgetting this is supposed to be a movie for kids?

My toddlers loved it because it is a movie bout singing pigs. For your information, the only TRUE ""singing pig"" in this movie is Rosita (Reese Witherspoon, if you weren't such an egghead). The other so-called ""pig"" is Gunter (Nick Kroll, in case you're living in cave), and he is a completely **self-absorbed, inconsiderate, overblown bozo** that nearly torpedoes Rosita's dreams with his oblivious bloviating and totally blithering blundering IDIOT!!

So NO, our standards have *not* gone down. This movie was made for us ROSITAS of the world, with a song in our hearts and who care about our families and never stop dreaming of our one big break in front of the whole entire town.

But meanwhile, GUNTERS like you should make like a leaf and STAY AWAY.

just kiss my ass! We also have the mouse who is a con artist, very full of himself, but a nice Sinatra-esque singer.  If you can relate to Buster he's got a story too that wasn't ruined by the trailers. But he's not played by Seth McFarlane... Both songs are by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. The song during the auditions is ""Kira Kira Killer"", and the one in the studio is ""Ninja Re Bang Bang"". It took me like an hour to find since I cant find find the songs listed on any page related to the movie. As someone else said, I thought they were tanukis, not red pandas. Red pandas are common in Japan also, and share habitats with tanukis. So true! The tease with ""Chandelier"" left me waiting whole movie for disappointment. Ruined otherwise great movie :( Same! I kept thinking they must have brought in Sam Smith for his parts. I thought he was awesome! I read that Taron can actually sing, loves to sing, and really looked forward to this. That being said, I think he's one of the brightest stars in Hollywood and I think he's going to SKYROCKET. He was so damn good in Kingsmen, now that the world will know he can sing I think it opens him up to a lot of possibilities. Yes, when the music started getting intense when the Koala jumped on the moon to ""go up from rock bottom"", I was really scared he was going to break out into song but was pleasantly surprised.  im not OP, but i saw it yesterday with my wife, and she was pretty understanding of the pig father, she said ""well, whant kind of job or jobs must he have to feed 25 pigglets? im sure its not easy"", later on, she noticed how even if the pig father arrived to sleep in the night, he was still tired in the morning, noting that whatever he does must have him stressed so much that the rest he gets isnt enough.  Yourcommonsens lacks common sense. The fact that the pig daddy can't even stay up while eating the pie or something, after he got back home from work shows how exhausted he is. Rosita feeds her kids and husband in the morning and night. At mornings after the kids go to school and husband to work, shes got nothing left to do. At night would be the longest she'd have to do something cause she  feeds the kids and husband, then reads them a book. How does that compare to working from morning til night if she has a huge break when the kids are at school. You must be one of those new feminists i keep hearing about, the man hating ones. Feminist for the win Ya that part pissed me off. What the hell happened to Mike?!? They just left it.  Actually I think the directors were really clever with that. I had heard about a trope in school that is called ""What Happened to the Mouse""

See here: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse

Essentially, I think it was an intentional nod to it. You can see other common tropes in the movie as well (looking at you, Wilhelm). 

Just my two cents. He drove away at the end, but the bear is climbing over the trunk into the car. And for the final scene where all of the singers are there at the grand opening, Mike is nowhere to be seen. He got turned into bear poop. Same actually he was a dick, and his reason for coming back at the end was definitely weak as well. I know that when the mice are driving away that the last we see is the bear mobster on their car so 'it's possible that the movie is saying the mice were eaten (without showing us their deaths) since hes not at the re-opening' but I highly doubt they'd have that happen.. I guess that'll be the case if he's not in the sequel but otherwise I don't buy into that.  Thanks!!

Google gave me nothin.  They were spelling Luck. Song is called kira kira killer by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. It does sound like they are saying F instead of L though. Japanese have a hard time with the L sound by the way. Zootopia, Sing, Finding Dory. Honorable mention to Secret Life of Pets which was hilarious on first watch through. I didn't get to see Kubo though. I think that would've definitely cracked the top 3.  Because the actors aren't skilled enough as singers, I imagine. They had the option to replace singing voices, but they chose to keep the actors and ensure they hit the right notes via autotune, and that's alright.  Oh no I meant why do YOU think it was pitch corrected? How did you come to that? I couldn't hear the artifacts it on most things, except Meena's long note.

I'm trying to figure out how to pick out pitch correction better, since I've worked with it and to me it sounds a lot different, but still it sounds like there's no way they could actually sing like that. Its driving me crazy that almost no one seems to care about what happened to Mike! Why not edit out the whole bear mob subplot from the ending if you aren't going to give some closure?!  I think he plays bass. Coz when u hold the neck of the guitar on your right hand, the bottom strings are the bass strings. I know it's crazy. I just thought of this because my friend holds the guitar on his right and left hand. When we were playing the guitar i noticed he's holding it on his right so asked, ""You're holding it the wrong way."" and he replied, ""Didn't you know i also play the bass? But without the bass guitar? I have no money to afford it yet so, i improvised."" One, they were not Tanukis. They were Red Pandas. Tanukis are chubbier and always brown. Two, his name is Buster not Mike XD I think Mike said ""you guys stink""...
 I agree, which is why I didn't feel like it was too much of an issue. But I figured that even with the British accents it would push a few buttons no matter what due to the whole unfortunate ape thing, which is why I mentioned that it should probably be avoided. your point about the portrayal of British people is a good one. Either way, I still liked the gorillas and their roles. Didn't like the elephants. I've seen it maybe 5 times. I'm really riddled by the Mike the Mouse ending. I tried to pay close attention to the final scene of the movie i.e. the grand reopening and it didn't appear to include mike with the rest of the group behind the red rope. You'd figure an attention hog like him would have been placed right at the front. Maybe there is a scene at the end of the credits? I loved how realistic it was tbh, real life nobody is perfect, everyone has their own story and circumstances, this movie shows that and how people despite their circumstances came to realize their talent. The characters feel real, the reactions feel real, it's all very believable to a certain degree and the characters actually deserve everything they did basically.  Really?  Without him wouldn't most of the characters still be ultimately unfulfilled and stuck where they don't want to be?  Not every good deed is born strictly of good intentions. I agree completely; that opening scene immediately made me dislike the Koala.

Then the rest of the movie is him trying to get resources for his theater by immoral means:

Begging the sheep for his parents' money.

Intruding on the sheep's family matters by visiting the rich aunt uninvited, again, begging for money.

Powering his theater using the neighbor's electricity.

Stealing water from the city for his enormous fish tank.

The entire movie he's using others to bail himself out for being a failure as a theater owner. And what does the movie do? They reward him at the end by making the aunt buy him the property! The message I got from his storyline is that you don't work hard and honest for what you want, instead you use others and wait to get handed to you what you want (no matter how big of a mess you are).

Edit: Had to add, I found it laughable that they depicted the bank representative as the enemy. Even before she came into the final act, I thought to myself ""isn't the theater the bank's property now?"" I was impressed that the movie acknowledged this fact at all, but they still depicted the bank representative as the enemy when she warned the Koala that they're tresspassing.

I get it, I'm nitpicking. But I've been spoiled with amazing animated movies with great messages and storyline that actually make sense. This was one of the most blatant cash-grab animated movies in recent memory. > musicals

Boy, we all lost the meaning of what an actually musical movie is like.

 [deleted] I really hope he isn't serious. I really hope he isn't taking this movie this seriously. Like, I'd understand if he were reviewing Minions and it got him that infuriated, but Sing is not worth that much anger.  Ya, it's hyperbolic as hell, but an enjoyable read. Of course I am, but it struck me as an odd choice As a furry, from what I've seen, furry Twitter is actually going nuts over the punk porcupine chick. Haven't seen the film yet, though. I have a thing for cute bunnies okay. Same goes for the Pink Berets. This is a piece for someone who likes the bare basic drama incorporated into contestants in a singing competition TV show, but can't be arsed to watch an entire season and just want a quick fix. 

This is the one thing that it does, and while it does well in my opinion, it's the only thing it can do and thankfully, it advertises to do. 

 I didn't actually watch the movie  Had no idea that sub existed. I'll give it a try. Thank you! yeah exactly. I think the movie is cute and it won't bore parents. Anecdotally people seem to love the movie from what I seen when I work at my theatre  It might be a movie for kids but there have been far better animated movies this year. This actually gave a terrible message to kids. The rat and the koala are both pretty awful characters and get rewarded for doing bad things the heck? is this a novelty account? So this post is three months old but I have to try because I have to ask, do you know what the pandas say during their audition? It sounds like M/F/N.U.C.K? ughhhhh I would have loved Chandelier. I also thought the singing was voiced by Ariana Grande, sounded just like here, IMDB said otherwise Wouldn't say ruined it but it was definitely disappointing. After getting over stage fright, being pressured by her (well meaning) family, being an assistant to a show she wanted to be in, and the little mouse fuck saying she's useless, I wanted the passion of Chandelier. She would've killed it  I was asking myself aftet finally seeing it... and his exit seems to be an in joke. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse at least that is my guess I'm hoping he got eaten - when we rewatch the movie I fast forward through all of his parts. I don't think I've ever disliked a character in a movie more. La Li Lu Le Lo Kubo was really cool.  Had a slight Burton feel to it without trying too hard and reminded me of James and the Giant Peach.

I'm surprised looking it up that it's from Laika, but I guess I shouldn't be after my above comment.  I've enjoyed all their movies. Cool, thanks!  I'm surprised I mean a lot of the actors are good singers in their own right (ScarJo, Taron Egerton). It would have been cool if they brought in vocal coaches instead of relying on so much editing in the studio.  i think the ending is for the adults. The bear is on the tail of his car grinning so it's implied curtains for the mice, but the kids will just assume that since he's not seen eaten he isn't eaten yet. I imagine it was implied that he gets his comeuppance.... since he was kind of the ""bad guy"" the whole time. Thanks. I figured they were Tanukis because Japan, but a once over of the credits confirms Red Pandas.  Well he left town with the girl and ran away, cause he couldnt stay with the bears. But as they are leaving you see the bear on the back of the car laughing. So what does that mean? Did the bear kill them? Did they get away? Like why include the bear in there? Just have them drive off together I totally agree. I mean, these are all complaining how Buster sucks at his job, how Mike is so evil, how Norman is so ignorant or not helping.. Watch a movie with no bad guys or rivals or people who lacks goodness. It would be boring. No one is perfect. Everyone has their fails and successes, fears, broken hearts, and evil sides. 
Also while people were so angry at the other characters i realized the movie really was great. The people were moved by it, hating and loving it.  I am thinking more on his method, so you wanna sing genre X, fuk that u are gonna sing in Y

and he did not push them to stop having their random shity job. Anyone with a hug pile of cash could have  done that.  Totally agree with you on all points. Further, the pig mom clearly was an engineering genius and that point was almost totally overlooked. 

I was relived that the squid were safe after the accident.  

 I don't think you're nitpicking. This is a movie for kids and the main character is making insanely wrong decisions and is being rewarded for it. Ugh i really disliked this movie thumbs up on every point. You and I had the same movie watching experience.  we'd drifted away from what musicals were like in the late 50s, with minor exceptions. 

 I watched it last night. She says ""get in"" and ""yeah"". I get exaggerating to make a point though. But yeah she had two lines technically. Might as well watch Zootopia again then.  Except, not really, because the competition never happens. No problem. Can you tell me when you got the answer? I've been looking for that song too The koala seemed more caught up in doing his dad proud than anything. His dad bought him the theater and it was his first show. I'm not surprised that he went a bit overboard ordering folks around. In the end he chilled out though, gave the elephant another chance and let ash do her own thing. He was a guy under pressure. The mouse, however, sucked.  It's fun to come to silent-bomb movie threads and look for the paid content and crazy people. They're singing LUCK. Because the Japanese pronunciation of L is ""eru"" and there was a lot of production noise, that was easily muffled. I tend to agree, but I have a feeling that was a set up for a potential sequel. Or it was just very lazy by the production.  I couldn't really hear the auto tune tbh. I'm not an expert in it or anything I've only a small amount of singing history but it didn't sound unnatural. Imo that other commentator didn't really know that the actors were decent singers and probably assumed the auto tune and then heard it because he believed it.  This was probably my biggest (nad maybe only) question I had, but I didn't think of it as they were eaten. Instead I took the revenue minded thought and assumed maybe they could use if for a spinoff or sequel? I don't know, that's just what I came up with. This really bothers me. I have been telling my wife the same thing... it's like they cut something out for the final edit. The bear was definitely about to get him, and he wasn't in the final scene with the rest of the cast. The mouse was easily the worst character, but to leave it so unresolved right at the climax of the movie was just bad. They got no cash and didn't leave their lives.  Escaping the circimstances isn't the point, it's dealing with them and following through with their passions while doing so.  I rather enjoyed the humble nature of it all. Movies are not morality teachers, you shouldnt expect every movie end with a morality lesson, you are the father, you teach them why it is wrong to do bad shit, that koala got away with stuff, but irl manypeople do so what. Sure thing :) Thank you  Holy crap, an entire sequel based around the least likable character. That's a major ""no thanks"" from me.
 For real. I mean, the elephant is actually a fairly popular musician, Tori Kelly. He's eaten. I mean, he already sang his funeral song, ""My way"". And he wasn't in the picture taking at the end. 
Assuming he survived for weeks. Why weeks? The picture taking took place after the theater was being rebuilt. So i said weeks. If he survived, why wasn't he there? He's dead. Kids won't know, i mean they don't inspect the movie like we, adults, do.  No, thanks to this comment section, ive found out, that they left his fate unknown on purpose, its sort of an inner joke for the director or something, look on tv tropes ""what happened to the mouse""  it means his fate is not important for the plot, and its an old trope, so they left it like that for the lols still how did he help out with that, he happened to write a note with the wrong number. He was not good at actually motivating anyone. Did you get the answer? Mike didn't get eaten.. Mike's girlfriend opened the car door which slammed the bear's stomach and Mike flew out of his mouth and drove away with his gf.  ...Who still definitely had noticeable pitch correction especially during the long notes at the end.

I think the only one I didn't hear any Melodyne on was Seth, but even then it could just be basically invisible. Thanks for the reply. While unsatisfying... it looks like you are exactly right. Now I'm even more fucked off than before, I would have been happier knowing that maybe they cut a small scene because of timing with music or sad plot ending. Right.  He, just like they, has his issues and passions.  He is not a perfect individual; not a Dumbledore if you will.  He was still integral to the events transpiring. Nope :/ Nobody replied to my post.  > Mike

BUT, you can clearly see that the bear made it ont the car, and they not noticing.. and then it cuts..
http://imgur.com/xUucnUa

Whats even more is that in the photo OP Mike is missing!
http://imgur.com/oWvq5iE You do know that pretty much every person uses pitch correction, right? It drastically reduces the number of takes it needs to record and splice to make the vocals of anything work perfectly. That's just how the recording industry works now, and more often than not, its used as sparsely as possible to avoid any noticeable digital sounds in the vocal recording.

We seriously need to get away from this stigma that autotune is bad. It's really, really not. It's only bad when it's used excessively to make a performer sound decent enough for a recording. It can even be used as an artistic choice to create a new sound. See: T-Pain, Cher, Kesha, all of whom are really talented vocalists, but have used tons of autotune to create a certain sound in their music.

And, yes, there is autotune on Seth's voice as well. He is a very talented vocalist, obviously, but of course no one is perfect enough for a one take and done, that is unless you want a raw sound like that in your recording, but that's not the case here. His is likely used the most sparsely, though, given the song his character was performing. [deleted] ye hes a horrible main character, so extremely unlikeable.  But there isn't another song after she sings Firework. Just like a brief stab of instrumentation? You say no-one is good enough for one take and done....what about live singers (who don't use autotune live)? What about all the singers from before the autotune era? Brad Delp from Boston certainly didn't need it. Michael Jackson was before it, and put his vocal stems into a tuner and you won't find much that strays from perfect pitch there.
Though I say Seth's wasn't/was barely tuned because I actually heard the inconsistencies in his. And because his live is basically the same as his recording.

Reese's I say was the most studio magic (not just autotune), followed by Scarlett, Taron, Tori, and Seth.

I read an [interesting blog entry on autotune-y things](https://kpopalypse.com/2013/07/27/does-your-bias-use-autotune-or-does-a-bear-shit-in-the-woods/)

Apparently it's at the point that it even fixes/can add vibrato (since at least 2013). Which explains all those squeaks/breaks and weird vibratos at the end of phrases everyone seems to have in radio pop now. I'm annoyed that they tried to attach subtle artsy notes into an otherwise shallow and subpar script Relatable though.  Everyone does selfish or narcissistic things.  His good intentions are subtle. [deleted] not really relatable he is horrible at what he is doing as well, not from a selfish standpoint but that his massive lack of talent and basic skills, if anything he was unrealistically bad at his job.
 And he had zero good intentions ",0
162,"Man, the kid who played Young Saroo was phenomenal. Just a fantastic performance.

I really enjoyed the movie, except I felt like they rushed through Saroo's adopted childhood, and I would've liked to see more of that, to understand the dynamics between him and Mantosh. Man the scene where he finds home and meets his mom I thought was so well done. Well acted all around, had me tearing up.  Were...were those kids being taken as sex slaves? The type of rich, diverse stories that producers in the US should be buying/funding.  Great acting from both Saroos, great score (second only to Jackie, maybe?).  Two things that keep it from being overall great:  I think we needed more time with young Saroo in Australia and more time with adult Saroo before he becomes so obsessed.  As it is, it goes quickly from ""kid gets new home!"" to ""young adult still feels lost and kinda crazy"", and I could have used a little more of a bridge.  Awful, while the writing overall is pretty good, Nicole Kidman's speech about her vision of a brown boy in the field...brutal.  Overall, really good flick. How was Patel's Australian accent? Because from the snippets I heard from the trailer I thought it had the potential to be one of the best, if not the best, Australian accents of all time. I feel sorry for the real life Mantosh, whose portrayal in this film was pretty harsh. I don't recall the book suggesting he had drug problems. He interacts with the family and works for his dad's company. 

Judging by a comment on his Facebook page, he found the interpretation of his character offensive and hurtful.

Saroo handled it fairly sensitively in the book, not giving too much away, but they seem to have used stretched the limits of poetic license in the film. I'm really happy to see this thread. I was looking at an old one from before the movie came out and I found a lot of nasty comments about how Saroo was stupid because he didn't know his way home. We are all commenting on computers and technology that comes so easily to us that some people don't even realize their privilege. He knew how to get to his home by himself from places near by, but he ended up extremely far away. He mispronounced the name of a small village that might not have been on any map. The movie ended saying that 80,000 children are lost in a year, there aren't the resources to try everything to reunite each child. They put his picture in the news paper, but his family couldn't afford a news paper and a news paper may not have even reach their village. He was also uneducated and when moved in with his adoptive family, it was the first time he ever saw a map. Also, unlike in the countries most of us are from, I read that he feared going to the police, because they didn't help beggars and would just bring him to an orphanage. A lot of people on the street were unwilling to help and they ignored him. I was also heartbroken to see people call her a bad mother. Yes, in our privilege countries, parents would get in trouble for letting their child do all the things that he did and she would be considered a bad mother, but we don't understand that poverty: to not be able to feed your family, to work for hours and get maybe a rupee, to beg for scraps just to get by while still being hungry. Being a single parent is hard even in privileged countries (#spoiler) This movie fucked me up. Our problems are so trivial comparatively.

Beautiful film. Sunny Pawar should win best supporting actor, if not best actor, at the Oscars for real. So was the brother hit by the train that night? My friends and I thought the writing at the end was a tad confusing. It would have made sense if so because that's why he didn't come back for Saroo. Either way, so sad once we read that news :(

Really enjoyed the movie, I hadn't seen Dev Patel in anything since Slumbdog Millionaire, he's just FANTASTIC. He also got extremely handsome. Great movie. Definitely lopsided though, just because the first half was so much more engaging with young Saroo being so phenomenal and the stakes so much higher. Dev Patel was great but 10 minutes or so could've easily been shaved from the back half, or maybe shown more time in India.

I agree that Mara's character wasn't great... but the lowest point for me was the monologue by Kidman. I mean, most of it was powerful when she was talking about loving both kids and choosing not to adopt, but it really suffered from that bit about ""having visions at age 12 about adopting a little brown boy."" And she keeps referring to the kid as ""it."" And does this mean she refused to adopt asian or black kids because her vision specified the kid had to be brown? It was very silly and contrived. I wonder if it's because the real-life mother had a bit a religious streak that they felt obligated to touch upon.

All in all, definitely deserves the oscar nom although some flaws from the back half make it hard to say it deserves to win.

But seriously, Young Saroo running was the cutest fucking thing.  It was a good film, though there are some flaws. Rooney Mara's character felt like a tacked on love interest that barely affected the plot. It felt a little too serious or over-dramatized at times, I know the guy was troubled over his past but at times there could have been a few more moments of joy.

Still, it has a great musical score. The movie also managed to keep a great flow of the events, keeping it from losing suspense. Young Saroo was amazing. Really great perfomrance. Very believable. 

Those ""trafficking"" scenes really hurt and I still think about.  Held back a lot of tears at the end, especially the scene where [Kidman talks about how she can have children.  What a powerful scene.](#spoiler)  I am grown ass man and I found myself crying like a little bitch while watching this movie. I felt the worst for his bro Guddu. In some way he was spared the pain of not seeing his brother for the 25 years and probably feeling guilty for having taken him with him. This was just a purely emotional and beautiful movie.  I completely lost it with the bike riding flashback at the end on the train tracks... Haven't cried for a film that hard in a while. The first half in India is amazing. The last 20 minutes starting when Saroo stumbles upon his home town is amazing. That middle half hour was not very good and holds it back from being truly great.

The first 2/3 of the movie I kept thinking to myself ""Lion.....why is this movie called Lion? I'm sure there's some symbolism that'll show up later to clarify."" As the last act unfolded, I forgot all about it. Then those text overlays popped up at the end....added a great deal of frission to the emotions I was already feeling.

God damn those last twenty minutes are so powerful. Holy damn.

I agree with the criticism that Rooney Mara's character is wasted. His adoptive brother, though, I feel is a bit crucial to this movie. That relationship needed more attention. A big theme of this movie is the relationship between brothers. It starts and ends with Saroo and Guddu. Guddu is constantly appearing in his thoughts and dreams (more than his mom I felt like). There is definitely a thread here that the director tried to explore but it isn't very well realized.   I'm from Melbourne and it was so surreal seeing places I actually know on the big screen 

Ngl dev Patel nailed the accent  [deleted] Yes, so happy to see this discussion thread after posting [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5kv4xg/lion_and_its_unique_niche_in_the_oscarssowhite/) just a few days ago. I saw the movie and was so eager to discuss with others!

Overall, the movie was really moving and, in my mind, avoided a lot of the cliches that I  thought might be coming.  Sunny and Dev ably carry the entire movie and I thought they both did an outstanding job. 

Reading a little about the actual story, I would have liked to see more of the real details included in the movie (apparently he rode multiple local trains around Kolkata for a few days before leaving the train station) but understand why they weren't included. I would have also liked a little more backstory on the brother and delving more into Saroo's relationship with him vs that of his with Guddu. 

Did anyone else think it was odd that Saroo never mentioned his sister? I think it was because he was closer to his brother but it was odd that he only mentioned that his mother and brother were looking for him, but never mentioned Sheikla, his sister. 

I loved the cinematography - the overhead shots to mirror the shots from Google Earth were great. 

Not a dry eye in our theater at the end - I really loved it.  I'll tear up during a movie every now and then, but I full on cried like 4 times. Not a perfect movie by any means, but damn good.  I loved this movie portrayed being adopted and not really connecting with the culture of the country you were born in. When he had trouble eating with his hands, people asking where he is from, etc...

Being adopted myself I get this all the time. People asking if I celebrate Chinese new year, if I speak Chinese, if I loooooove rice, etc etc...

I think the movie handled it well and hopefully now more people understand. I was adopted as a baby, I don't remember anything and my parents are Canadians. I'm more Canadian than I will ever be Chinese. I loved this movie. As a whole I understand why some people thought it was slow in the middle, but I thought there were so many great scenes (the scene where the kids are learning the names of the utensils??? So great.) I cried hysterically about 100 times, but 3 scenes stick out to me:

-The scene where Saroo meets with the lady at the orphanage, and before he leaves he stops and asks, ""Did you really look for my Mum?"" Sunny Pawar absolutely slayed that scene and the actress playing the woman was great, too.

-The scene where Saroo meets his adoptive family. Nicole Kidman's face was so full of wonder.

-When old Saroo sees Ganesh Teile on Google Earth and says, ""Ami."" *cue me having a full on loud sob* Guddu? Who exactly was rama? That fuckin pervert was a pedo? Or was he a agent to get kids to beg for money???  [deleted] I went into this movie thinking it would be about animals and ended up getting the feels instead. It wasn't a perfect movie; but I think it's an important story that deserved to be told. Haven't had to fight back tears in a theater like that in a long time.

With all the shit going on today (I know you could say that about any time period but still) it's important that people see something like this. The world is so much bigger than what we perceive in our own lives. I have nothing but respect for Sheru's parents, it takes a lot to bring in a child like that and fully embrace who they are. No one is perfect but I think they are great people for doing that. Not my favorite film of 2016, but probably the most emotional one. I'm a bit sad it's not getting more attention.

edit: also the child actor for Saroo looked just like his actual childhood pictures; I was amazed by that. Would be dope if that kid won something I really enjoyed the film, although I definitely thought the first half of the film set in India was better than the second. Sunny Pawar is just so adorable! He was the highlight of the whole film. 
Here's my review: https://iwandm.wordpress.com/2017/02/01/lion-review/ Anybody know what those guys grabbing the kids in the subway station were up to? Did anyone stay until post credits? Apparently there is another scene, just wondering what it was. [deleted] Anybody else think Guddu committed suicide? The kid knew his streets and all of a sudden he was hit by a train? I think he just couldn't handle the fact that his brother got lost and it was his fault for leaving him. That's just me though  I fucking cried in the cinema for the first time in my life.

Lion isn't a perfect film - the second ""act"" of this film in Australia is nowhere near as good or powerful as any of the stuff in India, and suffers mainly from some pacing problems... but I can forgive all that as there is a wonderful story being told here, and the acting from old and young Saroo is just wonderful... oh, and it made me bloody cry. i highly suggest everybody who loved the score for this movie to check out the works of Dustin O'Halloran, especially his group A Winged Victory for the Sullen. their newest album had many tracks featured in Lion. i've adored him and his group for years, as he's director Drake Doremus's right-hand collaborator, so that was my main selling point to see Lion.  This movie was incredible. I was holding back tears by the end just in awe of such an unbelievable feat. Looking past some of the minor missteps such as the Rooney Mara subplot and typical Oscar baity type scenes, this film is a fantastic case of perseverance and triumph. Just watched the movie today- wow, there really was not a dry eye in the cinema. I held it together until the very last scene with the two Mums hugging. As an adoptive Mum myself, it was particularly poignant. 

The scenes with young Saroo in India were so well done, it almost made the rest of it a let down.  Young Saroo and Guddu and their mom's performances were so beautiful, subtle, believable and endearing. 
Their bond is beautiful and I wanted to cry before anything even happened.

Rooney Mara's character was totally not needed in this movie, and if anything completely slowed it down. That whole part lost my interest from what was an incredible start. I was only happy when she got out of the picture, and we focused again on Saroo's return to India. I was aggravated whenever she would reappear in the picture. What she said was inconsistent, and I did not care whatsoever about her. But I guess every movie has to have the whole ""love"" thing. In this one, if they made it a less central part, the movie would've been phenomenal. I don't get how she got a spot in the front cover..

Does anyone have theories on what Noor and Rama(?) were up to? I still can't fully tell whether their intentions were harmless or not.


 [deleted] My dad is friends with the Briely family and has sailed with them in Hobart. He met them, Saroo and his brother when Saroo was deep in his search for his family about the time SBS began a documentary prior to the story being adapted into Lion. He said they're all lovely people and was nice seeing parts of Tasmania on the big screen.  I knew someone was going to pass away, I didn't think it would be Guddu. So sad. There are no pictures of him he is a mere memory.  Genuinely amazing film. Sunny and Dev both perfectly play Saroo, to the point where it at times felt like I was watching a documentary instead of a film. This is a top three film of 2016 for me. I wanted to watch it again immediately after it finished. The boy banging his head in the orphanage which brought the class to an abrupt end, was that the same kid as mantosh? They have similar episodes. Can anyone tell me how sad this movie is without spoiling it for me? Not sure if I'm emotionally stable enough to watch it because the trailer alone made me cry but it also seems like a really good movie I really liked this film.  The big surprise to me is how Dev Patel bulked out and how he handled the lead role.  Unfortunately the image in my brain is of Slumdog and would never have recognized him at all in this film.  And his Aussie accent sounded dead on.

I had minor story quibbles - mainly with Saroo's adopted brother - I understand why it needed to be dramatized but I thought the source material was so strong.  And I understand having the American girlfriend so that there is a love interest.  But these were little things that are easily overlooked by the strong first and third act.  Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman are both excellent. This movie was so powerful! The critics weren't kidding when they said it was a tearjerker. Lovely score, cinematography, acting. The first half worked better because it was more linear, the second half is messier due to many character introductions but still worked well overall. The final scenes of him reconnecting with his mother and walking on the rails had me in tears I have a younger brother and 2 small boys and the movie hit me hard.  I keep thinking of young Saroo on the train and keep thinking of my youngest son being in the situation. And what made it worse is my youngest looks like young Saroo as well.   Incredible score. I hope it gets nominated by The Academy.  I might have to name this my personal favorite film 2016. It's not the best film of all the Oscar nominees but it definitely hit me hardest. Te only film that got me close to shedding some damn tears. I guess I connected with it more as a brown dude also. My favourite part of the film has to be the first part, where we learn of Saroo's childhood in India. I was definitely impressed by the child actor for the young Saroo! Later, in Australia, Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman were both great.   
  
Overall, I really liked the film. Recommend!  [deleted] Seen the movie about 2 weeks ago. I think it's absolutely magnificent. I had some issues with characters Lucy, Mantosh and also Nicole Kidman's 'vision'. Though the part she said she could have had a child but chose to adopt instead, was powerful. Anyways, my biggest issue was the score! Which is the most favoured part of the movie as I've seen so far. The theme song was beautifully construct and so moving, but I just get disturbed when the same song is played multiple times throughout the movie, I can't help it. And Sia's song at the end?? WHAT THE F WAS THAT? I was furious when I heard it because the whole movie was such a great experience, and that ending, just when the emotionality peaked and we're truly content with it, so many people were crying, so many feelings, a lot to think about, and then, BOOM goes that upbeat, irritating pop song. I mean, tell me please, why the heck did they do that?! Just watched it my God im a guy and was holding back tears the whole time. Grew up in Pakistan and this movie brought me back. I miss home. 
This movies definitely in my top 10 Been a while since I cried like I did while watching this movie. The scene at the end where he finds his mom made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. A very powerful movie.  So I definitely can't fully relate to Saroo. I grew up very privileged (generally speaking) in the US. But as someone whose Indian father left their life for a while, I really connected with the ""I'm not really Indian"" line. Definitely a key part of who I am now, but I've been there too. 

That aside, I thought it was a good film. Still have it well behind La La Land and Moonlight, and maybe my personal bias came into play, but I enjoyed the acting (more so at the start), the score, and the ending was as powerful as it needed to be, given the buildup.  Sorry to get off on a tangent but the attempted (and successful) kidnap scenes in the movie compelled me to google India's missing children.  To wit:  150-180 children a day kidnapped off India's streets.  Horrible situation.  

As much I enjoyed The Lion, that thought is lingering with me much longer than the movie's shining plot.  I regularly meet folks from India, smart, engaging people.  And everyone is supposed to give India and its peoples a pass on their child kidnap situation that they elect to ignore?  Criminal. Little late here, but I just saw it and I wondered if anyone had discussed what I'm about to write below.

So, assuming the events in the movie are somewhat accurate, this really bugged me. When the kid is at the police station, they ask him where he lives. He says ""Ginestlay."" Obviously, that's not correct and none of them have heard of it.

But even in the 80s is there no fucking, like, book somewhere of ""Towns in India"" or anything? Like a City official or something?

I mean, I can excuse that, okay, since it's the 80s and they probably didn't really give a shit about trying to help some kid.

But then we go fast-forward to 2008 when Saruu is using Google. They didn't even show him trying to google ""Ginestlay"", but I mean, wouldn't it have been hilarious if Google had said, ""Did you mean Ganesh Talai?"" Or even go find a registry of towns in India, search by the Gs. Eventually he would have seen that name (pretty early on since it was G-a), and would have remembered how similar it sounded.

It just seems crazy that he found the town ""By accident"" instead of Googling when he had a pretty good idea of what the name phonetically sounded like. Beautiful film but I have a question. Is the film supposed to have this really low contrast look with super milky blacks? I'm asking because the trailers (even though they rarely have final color timing) looked normal, but when I saw it, it's exactly like I described it. Messing with the contrast, it does look infinitely better, I kept being pissed at the color timer because it just dragged the visuals down.

Then again, Greig Fraser's work (the DP) on Rogue One, and other films bears that low contrast, slightly milky look. 

Anyone? The soundtrack was really good!

The movie itself did stall about 4/5 of the way through, but the rest of it was fantastic. Too much feels, this is why I watch movies alone. I thought it was a good movie, especially the portions set in India. The child actor playing Saroo was especially talented and ought to get an Oscar nomination. The pacing in the second half did seem a bit slow. Also, I think the film soft-pedaled certain aspects of the story, especially the lives of street children in India. I cried a lot during the whole film I just watched it and I cried like a child for 5 minutes straight. I thought this film was just okay. It's not the worst kind of Oscar bait but it just felt very standard to me, complete with requisite Oscar clip scenes where one of the leads gives a big speech. I felt the troubled brother storyline was totally unresolved, I didn't feel much tension in the searching scenes, and overall I cared so much more about the scenes of just Saroo and Lucy as a couple then the search.

What I will say is the opening sequence just focusing on young Saroo is great. Garth Davis definite shows he has some skills as a director and it made me excited for his Mary Magdalene film. Also the score I thought was quite excellent.  link to discussion of the true story (spoilers) https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3nyhkt/til_a_5_year_old_boy_in_india_fell_asleep_on_a/?sort=new&st=ixnr46hk&sh=bdb2d62a I thought this was pretty good. The second half isn't quite as good as the first half and I wished Rooney Mara's character was more of, you know, a character and less of a plot device, but I really liked it. Beautifully acted, thoughtfully written, and intimately directed. Saw this movie last night and I thought it was a great story.  I know it's based on a true story, but did anyone else feel that it is almost unrealistic that Saroo was able to find his family again?  I have a pretty good memory from when I was a child but I find it hard to believe that Saroo was able to remember as much as he did.  Using google maps is such a cool idea, but again the fact he was able to locate where he grew up based on a map? I can't wrap my head around that!  My friend said he thought it was really interesting that when [Saroo found his birth mother that she was blind,](#spoiler) did anyone else get that idea, or was it just him?
 I LOVED the first 35minutes, the cinematography was astounding, that kid was fantastic. It was beautiful and so powerful but I'm sorry everything when he was grown-up was a waste. He was a mopey, lazy protagonist, nothing happened until eventually he was just looking at maps and moping. I hated it. So frustrating. I can't believe how disappointed this film made me. Even the ending, I knew I was suppose to feel something when he finally met his mother but I was so annoyed at that point. Such a disappointment. Also, I get it drone shots = google map, good for you. I'm sure the book is amazing and has more depth to it but the whole 2nd-3rd act was a wash. Sad because I'm sure it's an amazing story. Poorly handled. That ending bit where they tie the film into a larger cause is classic Weinstein company. It's an okay movie but they always do that. They tie movies into larger movements and that gives them more oomph around awards season. If anyone's interested in the darker side of the movie, please watch [Salaam Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaam_Bombay!)
Just finished watching it. It's freaking incredible.  Does anyone else feel that Guddu committed suicide because he could not locate his lil brother? This movie was so powerful  My grandfather was adopted and almost anything that has to do about adoption reminds me of him and all the stories he told me of being adopted and his family.  Whenever I see a film about adoption I bawl my eyes out.  I came into the theater not knowing what it was about and... shit.  I'm glad the lights are turned off in movie theaters. What the hell is wrong with me?! I felt sad with the movie and I was glad he found his family, but not a single tear was shed :( Back in '87, trains were red, not blue. (Major mistake)

The hindi dialogs seemed force translated from the english for the major part. 
 How are Mara and Kidman in this? I thought it was amazing.
Amazing performances all around.
I loved how it was like Boyhood or Moonlight but skipped the middle half.


My VLOG about it:
https://youtu.be/h-3lMsYukso A bit late to the party, just watched it. I was chilling, watching, all good... then at the end when he was [walking towards his mother at home](#spoiler) I bursted into a ""BWUAAAAAAH"" ugly crying. It's been 20 minutes and my face is still wet. I'm devastated lmao. [deleted] this was a good movie. actually teared up at the end with the bike and him meeting his mom [deleted] Great movie, liked every bit of it. At the end though, hearing Sia's music felt kind of out of place.  Loved the movie, especially everything involving young Saroo. It was absolutely incredible. That kid give an incredible performance. My only problem with the film was the one scene with Nicole Kidman where she reveals that she could have had kids. That was a great moment, but the scene as a whole felt like they tried overly hard to say, ok, we're going for an Oscar, hand it over. Great movie though, narrowly missed my top 10 for the year. Mantosh was one of my biggest problems with the film. Just a few times he and Saroo didn't get along and there was no resolution. Not quite sure what the point of focusing on his character so much was.  Yeah, I also wanted to see more of his growing up years in Australia. But what they did show really opened my eyes to what adopted children, particularly those from another country who are old enough to remember life there, must feel when they come into a whole new life. It must be completely overwhelming. And I feel for the parents, as there's just no way to comprehend what a child might have gone through and might be feeling. The build up fuuuuuucked me up. I was trying my best to wipe the tears away on the sly and then finally just broke the fuck down. Made all kinds of weird noises and shit. But it brought me closer to my wife, to be so vulnerable. The shots of his village that had been flashing through the entire movie and the build-up to finding his house and the slight disappointment there was all incredible. The very end had the entire theater in tears.  I was teary eyed after he found his mother, but when they showed the real footage I got really emotional and started crying a bit. 

Really enjoyed this film (I do agree though that the second act in Australia after he goes to his friend's for the Indian food was weaker but I still enjoyed it) 

The parts where he is a child are really good, the shit he had to go through, especially with the paedo guy made me sick. Fun fact, all of the extras in that seen were actual members of the village Saroo is from. no lie. i was legit crying in the theater. I'm a guy too--no fucks given.

That shit was so powerful and happy.  i was shaking from how emotional that scene was. the whole movie was a feels roller coaster, cried my eyes out.  I (28 M) was bawling That was my assumption...either that or to be used as beggars (a la the blinding scenes in Slumdog Millionaire). I assume Noor and her arrangement with 'Rama' was a similar situation.  Also I think there was the assumption the kid in the orphanage who was banging his head against a wall was being sold to another guy as a sex slave by the guards.  I'm sorry to reply to you in such an old thread, but the other possibility was that the children were being kidnapped for organ trafficking, which is also a significant problem in India for street children. Sex trafficking, Organ trafficking, Chopping their limbs off / making them blind so they can use them to beg on the streets and generate more money than a normal kid could. There are just too many possibilities. It's up to you to decide. But one thing for sure they weren't being taken to Disneyland. Or probably to make that shirt you’re wearing. [deleted] Looking back, her speech is a bit odd I think they should've left that out. Kind of made it sound like she was doing him a favorable instead of from the goodness of her heart.

In saying that though I really liked Kidman's character in the film. Yeah as an australian, the accent was really good. My Australian friends who weren't familiar with him didn't realize he wasn't originally Australian, which I figured was a good sign. The fact that he doesn't sound cartoonishly Australian almost made me think he didn't bother it sounds so natural. Aussie here, just saw it today and fully assumed he was actually Australian.  I'm not Australian, so grain of salt, but his accent blew me away.  I saw this tonight. Dev's accent was really really good although there were some moments when he slipped up (these were few and far between however). I doubt American's would've noticed I was convinced that he was Australian until I remembered that he's actually British. Wow, that's a bit disgusting then.  damn that kinda sucks to hear that :/ I haven't read anything from Mantosh's Facebook page. But if I had to guess, the writers were made it seem like he struggled with Reactive Attachment Disorder. RAD is very common in adoptive children.  You might find this podcast interesting. Sue Brierley recently talked a bit about it.

http://www.mamamia.com.au/mantosh-brierley-lion/ [deleted] Probably shouldn't take his Facebook comments as pure fact... just saying > I found a lot of nasty comments about how Saroo was stupid because he didn't know his way home.

That's interesting - I found a lot of nasty comments about how he couldn't possibly have remembered everything he claims to have remembered. (I don't know how those people think he found his way home). Some people will never be satisfied, I guess. As an australian, i can say that Dev patels Australian accent is really good.

I was sniffling amd teary for most of the film deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9077  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/53879) I agree.it is such a powerful movie.  He was hit by the train, but after Saroo left. There is the scene where Guddu is calling out for Saroo after he came back to the train station and is climbing over the tracks. We don't see anything of him after that. 

Yes, Dev has gotten very handsome. I've always thought he was a really capable actor and he's made a lot of great choices in terms of embracing diverse roles and pushing the envelope.  Ya but I think it was after Saroo left on the train. But how sad both kids gone on the same night. 

Acting was amazing.  In the book Saroo's mother told him Guddu died that night. 

 I read that they didn't find the body for awhile, but it was assumed he died that night. It is unknown if that was why Saroo couldn't find him or he was killed after while looking for Saroo. (#spoiler) > So was the brother hit by the train that night?

Yes The mother wasn't religious, but did have a vision of a ""brown boy"" in real life. It wasn't anything like a ""nervous breakdown,"" according to her telling. An ""Asian or black kid"" could easily fall into the very general category of a ""brown boy."" I think she just meant that she always had a strong sense that she wanted to adopt a child from another country.

Kidman's character arc did bother me. They made her far too emotionally fragile. She didn't have a breakdown in the book, she didn't fall to pieces over Manosh, Saroo didn't stop speaking to her while looking for his real mum, and there was none of that ""I need you, Saroo"" stuff. She comes across as a loving but very capable, down-to-earth Australian mum. 

I think they just felt the need to make hundreds of hours of searching Google Earth more emotionally fraught than it really was, hence the whole Rooney Mara thing.

I would almost have preferred they made that part of the movie upbeat and fast-paced, and focused on the complexity of the project itself rather than manufacturing the emotional breakdown of the family.

Young Saroo though. He deserves all the awards. You hit the nail on the head. Her monologue is the exact same point in the movie that I thought was weakest, and I agree big part of it was when she got into her vision. 

I also agree that the first half was a lot more powerful, but all in all fantastic film which had me on the brink of tears several times. The final reunion really tied it together beautifully.  Both the adopted brother and Mara felt like characters who were added because they existed in real life, and they were trying to stay as close as possible to the actual story. If the filmmakers were willing to play hard and loose with the facts, I think it could have been an A+ movie instead of B+. I thought it helped develop Saroo's struggle a little

How he can't form healthy relationships because of his obsession  I teared up as well.  One interesting thing about the brother [the movie and real life were apparently different, according the end of film dialogue](#spoiler) Why is it called lion? Fission? Did you mean frisson?  Yeah, I was stunned by the accent. Most people overplay it (G'dye, myte!) and I think it must be really hard to emulate our relaxed Australian drawl. I've been living in Melbourne for the past 3 and a half years and I couldn't point out the places :( I'd have to guess it was because of the sheer amount of places in India. Ganesh Talai is just a small village, no one outside a 20-kilometre radius of the town would even know it existed.

Ganeshtayle sounds an awful lot similar, but no one could recognize it because of how small a place it is. For all Saroo knew the proper pronunciation could have been Janushtely or something.

I think if Google Earth had a feature in 2008 that let you find every train station and water tower next to each other in India, he could have found it 10 times faster. But with so many stations, he had to individually check each one in half the country. I saw 'Lion' yesterday and was so moved by it, I read the whole book too. Part of the problem was that, as the years went by, his recollection of the time he spent on the train was distorted. He believed he was only on the train about 12 hours, when in actuality it was closer to 30. This led him to search in a much narrower radius than was necessary. Also, he knew he came from a place called 'Ginestlay', but he didn't know whether that was a city, a village, or even a street. He knew that the railway station where he was separated from his brother started with a 'B' (Burhanpur), and that it had a water tower. That was all. I won't say any more because reading his account is as fascinating as the film. >Why didn't he get a list of every town, or better yet, every one that started with G, and then search around the area on google maps?


Even now, there's still not a Wikipedia article for Ganesh Talai, and the majority of Google results are about Saroo's story. He didn't know how far he had travelled from Ganesh Talai. He actually thought it was a much shorter journey than it was, so the radius was huge.

Ganesh Talai is a tiny village. I use Google Earth a lot, and in developing countries it's virtually impossible to find a list of all villages. Even if you know the name, it can be hard to find.

His search was actually pretty effective, just painstaking. He did interact with people online, too, which they didn't touch on in the film. In the book he remembers the name wrong (couldn't pronounce it as a child) Late response, but I just watched this and think I can help. He might have actually tried what you suggested but it would have never worked, because his town ended up being outside of the radius that he was searching in for those 2 years. He did all that research but the fact that the radius was too small is what made it all for nothing.  > Did anyone else think it was odd that Saroo never mentioned his sister? I think it was because he was closer to his brother but it was odd that he only mentioned that his mother and brother were looking for him, but never mentioned Sheikla, his sister.

Likely just trying to keep the story moving. FYI, if you read the book (I just started it after seeing the movie) you learn very quickly that Saroo actually had two brothers, Guddu and another older one named Kallu that isn't even mentioned in the movie. I'm guessing that the Guddu in the movie is an amalgam of the real Guddu & Kallu, again just to keep the story simpler for the sake of the movie. This movie absolutely fucked me up. Several parts that had me crying like a little bitch. 1. Saroo nearly getting kidnapped along with the other lost / homeless children. 2. Saroo's sleepless nights browsing Google Earth satellite view / cutting out to the actual locations that he remembered in his head. The way the camera switched between showing the similarities in the terrain, landmarks - what a genius idea. I got goosebumps when he was following the train tracks to the bridge to Ganesh Talai on Google earth. 3. Saroo following/walking behind his older brother on the train tracks. Reminiscing about the times.  4. The actual photos / video clips of the real Sue / Saroo meeting his biological mum etc. This film gets a 10/10 from me. He probably didn't have many memories of his sister to begin with. Apparently he also had another brother, but we don't even see him mentioned in the film. It's so damn inconsistent. At its best it's the best film of the year, but there are several questionable decision (almost all of them involving Saroo's time in Australia) that really muddy up the film and slow it down.  I thought I was finished crying when the movie ended, then they showed the real life pictures and updates I sobbed even harder. I was a mess when I left the theater.  One of the lines that hit quite hard was when Saroo casually said ""I'm not really Indian I'm Australian"" to that effect...so many adopted children are raised without some connection to their heritage and it skews their identity. Glad this film touched up on it - albeit in a nuanced way. That's neat, imagine if the movie had been based on the life of a Chinese adoptee instead of an Indian one. We wonder how the perception of such a film would be different if it was centered around a person of East Asian descent. Surely, a movie such as this probably be quite popular in the Chinese market, but would it achieve the same acclaim among Western audiences?

Chances are, they would cast an Asian actor with non-stereotypical features, such as large eyes and a thin nose in order to make the lead character more palatable to Western audiences. So probably someone who looks like Leehom Wang instead of Masi Oka, even if the real life person looked more like Masi than Leehom I wasn't even adopted but am biracial. I was raised by my mom and stepdad, with my half brother - they are all (at least visually​) white, and I'm not. People always make assumptions about me based on my skin color, but for all intents and purposes I was raised ""white"" but could never fully connect to either side. I related so much to that scene. It hit me pretty hard.  ….Guddu? In real life, I don't think that Saroo knows, really. Just that he felt something was wrong, so he ran away. It's entirely possible that Rama was going to do what he knew to provide a better life (which would probably be adopting Saroo out to a wealthy family), but it's also entirely possible that he was a pedophile or in charge of a child begging ring or a slave master who would have forced Saroo to work in dangerous conditions. These are all common outcomes for the children of India who go missing or are otherwise orphaned...If you go to lionmovie.com, they have ways you can donate to help alleviate the problem. Dev Patel is also involved in some other charities not highlighted there, I believe...but in regards to the film, I think it was purposefully left unclear to show how much confusion there was while Saroo was on the streets and also to make Sue's speech about choosing Saroo and Mantoush even more powerful. All the ways that Saroo could have *not* ended up at that orphanage at that time make it clearer to them that Saroo was **meant** to be their son... Yeah, I noticed that too - it seemed like an odd choice (not sure if there's any symbolism to be seen there).  Marketed for bollywood as well The trailer was so damn cheesy but I really liked the movie.  Apparently a couple thousand people auditioned for the role of young Saroo. Around Bombay we often hear stories about guys who run around and chop kids limbs off and then make them beg and take all their money.  I assumed it was that Sex trafficking Just saw the movie last night. It was the scene where Saroo and Guddu were on top of the train, the camera kinda focuses on Guddu and text appears ""In memory of Guddu"". I agree about the middle part dragging a bit but omg the beginning and ending. I could not stop crying. 80,000 apparently. I actually thought different. In the real story, we don't know that Guddu even yelled Saroo's name at the station, it is in fact just imagined by Saroo in the film. I think Guddu died on those tracks, which was why he never came back for Saroo. I mean who knows how long Saroo was passed out on that bench. You know what, now that I think about it, that must be the case.

I assume the family did not want to paint it that way, nobody would want that. 

But I think that has a high chance of being true. Especially considering the mom was mad at Guddu for leaving Saroo when he got hit by the motorcycle while carrying the Watermelon. Considering he lost him a second time, this time potentially permanently, he must have felt no hope and did not have the heart to deliver the news. And as a kid, maybe just an early teenager (maybe not even that), it must have been tough. 
 [And what of the brother with whom Saroo had originally gone travelling? Unfortunately, the news was not good. ""A month after I had disappeared my brother was found in two pieces on a railway track."" His mother had never known whether foul play was involved or whether the boy had simply slipped and fallen under a train.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17693816)

Must be a suicide. 2 pieces? Sounds like he laid down on the track. So tragic.  I would assume he would first try to find his brother before just killing himself right away. I don't think it would have been suicide. Plus his mother depends on him so much, I don't think he would have.  I never even considered this until you mentioned it. I don't think so since he died the same day Saroo went missing. I would have expected him to search for at least a few days. I suppose it's possible if the scene about their mother screaming at him for not watching Saroo and questioning his love for his brother is true. Guilt might have made him panic.

I initially thought it was so sad that Guddu died never knowing that Saroo had been found, but then I realized he might have died before he ever even knew Saroo went missing. I hope he didn't realize Saroo was missing and then panic so much that he was struck by a train. 

My belief now is that Guddu left Saroo, got hit hit by a train, didn't return to Saroo, and then Saroo got lost. In that scenario, I'm glad Saroo didn't stumble across Guddu's body cut in half. 

So much of a mystery to me.  [deleted] I cried my eyes out. 
My mother took me to the village where she grew up when I was 6. I remember her pointing at the kids and saying it easily could have been you.
I backpacked India 14 years ago. I remember the street kids and some of the horrible things I saw..
I never had a movie that made me cry so much.  I agree, the Australia part didn't always hit the right notes, and they overplayed the melodrama. In the book it isn't that intense, and Australians are not that intense. 

There was so much emotion in the Indian parts of the story, beginning and end, that I felt it would have been better if they'd saved the dramatic stuff for those parts instead of dousing the Lucy/Saroo relationship with so much pathos and making Sue look like she was having a nervous breakdown (in the book she comes across as sensitive, but pragmatic, supportive, and a very capable mum).

But overall it was a stunning piece of filmmaking and the cinematography was amazing. I knew it would be emotional, but I didn't expect it to be so profoundly moving, especially thinking of all the children who weren't rescued. Same.  Just got home from watching  Lion and my brain and face are swollen from crying.  And I NEVER cry during movies.  *Great* fucking movie, makes me want to run over to India and help the tens (hundreds?) of thousands of kids currently suffering but I feel so helpless to be able to. Thanks for saying that. I had no idea Dustin had a band. I've been searching for his other works after seeing the film. Also, are you talking about their Atomos album? I found myself crying unexpectedly at random scenes! When it showed them sailing and playing on the beach, TEARS. At the end I was openly weeping and everyone thought I was crazy.  Rama was a pedophile (or a pimp for pedophiles, or both). In the movie, Noor picked up Saroo to give to Rama for that purpose. Noor and Rama appeared to have a sexual relationship, so maybe he traded favours and financial support if she procured children for him.

In the book, I had a feeling the woman who helped him wasn't consciously selling him into slavery - she was just handing him over to someone who assured her he could help. But I could be misremembering. That part made me so sad. Noor means light. I thought she was going to be the helping factor. Especially when she gave him that drink. But it was definitely not harmless. I guess she owed Rama something and she got him the kid. They were going to use Saroo for prostitution. 9 million of them in Calcutta, 20% of them are children. I see what you're saying about the disconnect between yound and old Saroo but I see it as ""that's kind of the point."" The character is based on the real Saroo who struggled with depression and coming to terms with his past. I think the jarring disconnect between the young and the old Saroo was exactly that, he was quite literally a different person with a different life once he got to Australia.  In the scene where Saroo is in the cell with all the other children and they all start singing the song, what is implied to happen or what happens to the kid who is taken away? That part really hit me especially with the actual population in real life of kids like this, in these scenarios. Was the part about Sarro's  adopted brother being mentally ill true and if so, How is he doing? How different is Tasmania from the rest of Australia? I think the boy in the orphanage was named Shondeep. I think it's safe to assume they were abused sexually (mentioned briefly in the book). I don't think so...they were different actors and I think they had different names (unless they didn't say the name of the boy in the orphanage). It was probably them just drawing a connection between the two.  Nope There are instances where they show the reality of what homeless children go through, cried after all of it. It's pretty fucking gut wrenching if you have a soul or any sort of compassion for people. That said, it is equally inspiring and an openly weeping type of film - there's no wiping a random tear off your cheek on the sly with this film... you will make odd noises if you try to hold in the emotions. I don't think a box of tissues is enough. I think a hand towel is best suited when watching this. 

Now, without knowing what your emotional instability is based on, I would say that if you have lost anyone close to you (i.e. a sibling, best friend or parent) recently, don't watch it... yet. Give yourself some time to heal. If you just broke shit off with someone after a long relationship... watch it... with them... if you want to get back together. That was what made it so upsetting for me. I have 2 boys and my youngest is the spitting image of Young Saroo in the movie. It was heartbreaking. I still can't stop thinking about it. I was actively trying not to imagine my daughter in that situation where she is in a train or lost in a station filled with people. I'm adopted so it hit me as well! From India, I will try my best to answer your questions.

-My best guess is that those men would be using the children to beg. They probably run a whole such ring. There are many other darker things that could be the reason, but this one seems the most probable.

-I think again, the movie doesn't say explicitly what those two were up to, but the way that Nawazuddin(Rama) checks out Saroo, and just in general acting like a creep, suggests some sort of sexual exploitation. 

-He's probably been beaten and left somewhere. Too much of a headache for those running the orphanage.

 >-When Saroo is in the orphanage, one of the boys is taken out and goes away with a man and is supposed to be brought back before morning--what is that about?

In an [interview](https://youtu.be/J1Fzj8EFHuw?t=154), the actual person in real life (Saroo) calls it a ""prison"". So I assume it's an orphanage of rounded up homeless children, but it's treated more like a juvie. 

I was really curious why Saroo described it as a prison too, there must have been some really bad conditions in there.  I completely agree with you. The movie ended and I was bailing my eyes outs and once it started playing I was like ""why are they ruining it with this shitty song?""

But this also reminds me of slumdog millionaire, which dev patel also stars in, and how it ended it a big dance number. This could just be to mirror bollywood movies and how they always end with a cheery song. I don't think the fact that you're a guy is really relevant to the fact that a movie made you emotional.  Yea man I agree. Hope it gets recognised by the academy.  I felt that the score was a bit heavy handed at times, especially near the end.  It definitely supported the emotion, but certain times it felt like it was *creating* the emotions.   [deleted] That scene rattled me too, I bawled my eyes out because in realty that is happening to kids everyday, it hurts my heart. Yeah they apparently pulled no punches when it came to the missing/kidnapped child problem over there India has an enourmous amount of people who speak something like 30-odd languages.  Plus Ganesh Tali was a small town.  Imagine asking someone from New York City if they know of a small town in rural Ohio.   Agreed. I feel like they could of completely gotten rid of the Rooney Mara portion and fleshed out the relationship with the Australian family.  The young Saroo section at the beginning of the movie was by far the best part. I honestly think that this would have been a better film if they just expanded more on Saroo's life at the orphanage and more about of his life adjusting/growing up in Australia as a kid/teen and the family drama with his adopted brother.      
     
The extreme 20 year time jump halfway though really killed the pacing of the movie. I agree with you 100% The Saroo and Lucy storyline was so unnecessary to me. I feel like the movie would've been better without so much focus on them. I agree. I *liked* it, but won't remember it as great. Young Saroo's exposition was great. I know, Lucy was a horrible addition to this movie. It's true. [He really did use Google Earth. Amazing. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saroo_Brierley) Seems realistic to me. Not super easy and probable, but realistic enough to get widespread media attention and a movie based on it. No. I read the book before seeing the movie. He never says she was blind. Actually to prove it's him she ""looks for"" the scar on his head from the watermelon accident.  > He was a mopey, lazy protagonist

Which is a pity, because he didn't come across that way in the book at all. 

 Ditto here.
Was frustrated as well in cinema.
Last 10 mins were nice tho as well. Great move and great company Thanks for the rec, Lion definitely left me with a lot of questions​ about the few weeks he spent in Kolkata, with all the random and strange encounters he had with people. yes, my first thought watching the scene where guddu searches for saroo was that he would run away. the moment they said he's dead, it felt like a stab in the heart. Sorry this is a late post, but in real life guddu died the same day saroo got lost. Thats why he never came back that night, he was actually hit by a train. The real saroo said something along the lines of ""my mother lost both sons in the same night"" Kolkata was so clean and so empty. I also was so excited for Bengali and it was all Hindi caterwauling haha Kidman is excellent, Mara is just a plot device rather than a role.  [deleted] it's slumdog millionaire. Perhaps mixing ""Live and Become"" and Slumdog memories. I have the same recollection.  I watched a movie on an airplane 1-2 years ago.  Before Lion was released.  I too have been searching for the movie.  So baffling. I think that scene was really crucial because Saroo's character had an enormous amount of guilt,  feeling that his mother deserved her own (in his mind: better) children. Her telling him he was her first choice helps him let go of his shame/feeling of obligation and pursue his past.  My dad (volunteered at a Romanian orphanage around this time period) thought the point of Mantosh's character was to show that for every well-adjusted, adaptable kid like Saroo, there's gonna be one or two more who don't have such an easy time.  
Outside of documentaries, media about adopted/foster kids doesn't often speak of the psychological abuse and damage they suffer from, especially in countries where the adoption system is lackluster (Hungary, India, etc). I agree the plotline needed a better resolution but I thought it was important that they include him, kind of just as a reminder. I think it was to show the parents sacrifices, and add more weight to Kidman's heartbreak when the main character went MIA on her.  I really wanted to know more about Mantosh. I really hope he gets the help he needs (#spoiler) ditto  It's a ugly cry inducing type scene that's for sure. Very powerful moment.  Exact same thing. I controlled and then finally i couldn't stop my tears  from flowing. the pedo guy scene scared me so much. I have a nephew who is the same age as young Saroo was and I can¡t even imagine how I would react if someone touches him like that guy was touching Saroo. fuck pedos Wow you're a guy and you cried? Crazy. I could understand women crying over an emotional scene but a guy? Unheard of. Don't forget the kids in the orphange being raped. This movie was frighteningly accurate  :[ I'm not sure, one of the guards says ""Have him back by morning."" 

I do think he was being raped, but I think it was by either one of the teachers or the guards. I don't think it was a sales thing. > the other possibility was that the children were being kidnapped for organ trafficking

Thank you.  That was the single biggest question I had after seeing the film, and had hoped there'd be more discussion about it.  So based on this and another comment, it seems that the likely scenarios would be organ trafficking, working as beggars, or perhaps being sold as sex slaves.

Good lord... :-[ Yes, awful.  Bad, bad writing in a moment that was important. > That was the only scene in the movie that made me bored

For whatever reason I found both his parents to be a bit boring and hard to watch on screen. I don't think Kidman did a particularly good job and seemed to be veering on the edge of melodrama for most of her performance. The Saroos were both great. Little Saroo was phenomenal. Yeah while the rest of the film was fantastic, the twenty or so minutes around this scene did stall it a bit. I'm Australian too and the little I heard I was impressed. Which was good because the accent can be really tricky. Just from the trailer I thought he was Australian! While I'm not the best with the Australian Accent even I could regonise how good his was as it wasn't cartoonish and over the top like I hear in other films (Pacific Rim, still love that film though) haha. Same as me man. I was thinking wait a minute, that slumdog kid is australian? It was that convincing.   Apparently he learnt it by watching Australian masterchef! As a Brit I felt those slips stick out a bit, as suddenly saroo is British haha. But mostly perfect.  I think for a diagnosis of RAD, onset has to be within 5 years of birth. 

The self-injurious behavior represented onscreen (head banging, slapping head) as both a child and an adult suggest autism, and he was also depicted as a drug problem as an adult.

Regardless, all of this is unfortunate if untrue, and perhaps just as painful if true - Hobart is a small place, and it must be hard to outrun problems that have been made public. 

I just can't help feeling they capitalised on an aspect of the story that gave a potentially sentimental tale a bit of an edge, in the same way that they dramatised the ""Lucy"" storyline. Thank you!

Edit: Wow, poor Mantosh. The movie obviously brought up a lot of stuff for him. It must be hard witnessing his brother's success and a happy ending to that story, while he's still struggling. When Saroo first visits Mantosh at the shack, he's smoking a joint. The second time he visits him at home, Mantosh won't wake up, and the indication is that he's drugged. Saroo sits with him for a while while he's sleeping. There's drug paraphernalia in the background.

The [script](http://la-screenwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LION_Script_wCover_R31.pdf) adds that (fictional Mantosh) was a meth user:

>He holds his hand out, horizontal.
MANTOSH: ""I’m off the speed, mate.""
Perhaps his hand trembles, just a little; Saroo notices. 

I don't think they ultimately included that line in the movie, though.

Just in case you think I'm imagining things, here are some reviews of the movie that allude to the presence of fictional-Mantosh's drug problem in the movie:

From the New York Times [""He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), who was also adopted from India and has mental health and substance-abuse problems.""](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/movies/lion-review-dev-patel.html)

From Consequence of Sound: [""This often takes the form of their other adoptive Indian child, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), a frustrated young man struggling with autistic fits and drug addiction.""](http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/12/film-review-lion/)

From the Sydney Morning Herald [""Mantosh (Divian Ladwa​) struggles with drink and drugs.""](http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/nicole-kidmans-vision-that-foreshadowed-her-role-in-lion-20161221-gtfxye.html)

From Critics at Large: [""Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) lives an itinerant, sometimes drug-addled life, his periodic disappearances plunging Sue into depression.""](http://www.criticsatlarge.ca/2017/02/finding-home-lion.html)

Additionally, Mantosh mentioned on his (public) Facebook page that he objected to being portrayed as a ""druggie,"" but I won't link to that here. His Mom also says something to the effect of that when he gets back from working the lobster boat he'll be flush with cash and able to buy ""the hard stuff"". His Facebook comments only indicated how he *felt* about his portrayal in the film. There were no ""facts"" in them. 

I didn't make any allegations about the veracity of the film based on those comments - I simply compared the film to the book. [deleted] Young Saroo stole my heart hands down. I want to see so much more of him I think we could have done without Rooney Mara's character but the contrast between the relationship of Saroo and Mantoosh and Saroo's perceived relationship with Guddu could have been explored more and would have really elevated the story as a whole. Even if they weren't entirely factual, drawing something out of the relationship would have really helped the overall story. Rooney Mara's character wasn't anything like ""Lisa"" in the book, who was a minor character and nowhere near this emotionally intense. What do you think was different? Spoilers galore. 

The main character, Saroo, is split up from his family at a very young age. As the film ends, they do the whole thing with text coming up in screen. ""Saroo was taken from his family for this long."" ""His mother did this while he was away"" ""His brother did this while he was away."" Ya know what it's like. Pretty standard stuff for this kind of movie.

Then it had a few paragraphs about this problem that is troubling India. ""Millions of children every year are accidentally taken from their families."" ""Though modern efforts have reduced his number, it's still an issue affecting thousands of families."" ""To learn more about this problem and how you can help, go to our website.""

While all this is going on, the screen is showing (behind the text) shots of the real life Saroo in his estranged village, and actors interacting with their real life counterparts. After the suggestion to check the website comes up the screen finally fades to black. The music is teaching an ending point. I figured the movie is done. Then a little bit more text pops up.

""After 25 years, Saroo learned that he had been mispronouncing his own name.""

""His name is actually Sheru. It is a Hindu word which means....""

Big bold letters center screen as the final note of the music chimes

""LION""

Hard to do it justice in a reddit comment. It just caught me so off guard since it seemed like the credits were due. When the message popped up saying to go to (website), this to me marked the end of the movie. Any other movie would end on that and go to credits. So this small post script, bringing you briefly back into the world of the movie and answering a question that had nagged at me for the first hour and a half of his movie before forgetting about it...it was a beautiful moment of artistry and patience and trust in the audience. 

It seems small but it left quite the mark on me. No it added fission. Trust me I'm a nuclear scientist. I'm pretty sure one of the scenes had Dev and Rooney talking in St. Kilda. It was clearly not the focus though so it's hard to tell. Just saw the movie and really enjoyed it.

Would you recommend the book? Does it go into his relationship with his brother more? Just saw the movie and really enjoyed it.

Would you recommend the book? Does it go into his relationship with his brother more? Ah, I see that makes sense. Although, if I was really that motivated to remember. I probably would have gone as far as going through every town and village in India. Probably not feasible though as I heard many villages are unlisted Kallu is actually mentioned once. When Saroo tries to convice Guddu to allow him to come with, Guddu says ""Who will look after [sister's name]?"" 

And Saroo replies ""There is Kallu."" Or something similar. I remember thinking, who is that? And then they're never mentioned again...
 He had tons of memories of his sister, and his early life in Ganesh Talai. I was astonished that a five year old could remember so much. After he was lost, it seemed like he actively reinforced what memories he did have as something to hold onto. Going back to his little sister, he had an especially close relationship with her, he was her guardian.The movie places more emphasis on his relationship with Guddu. The Rooney Mara stuff was confusing. Almost like a character added in so we could hear him talk about what he's doing. Dunno why Mara signed on for this, feel like she's above roles like that.  Maybe not in the States, but in Canada lots of people were adopted the same way I was. They would travel in groups and adopt together.
I think there would be interest Assumptions are the worst, I totally feel you. Sorry for reply in old thread but I found this quote on a site and did fact checking if kissing was indeed considered taboo (which it was).



""If you found it strange that Saroo (Dev Patel) and Lucy (Rooney Mara) don't ever kiss in the movie but share plenty of embraces and time in bed together, this is because showing kissing in Indian movies is largely considered taboo and was almost never seen before the 1990s. Until recent years, the dictates of the censor board usually forbid it. This is why most Bollywood movies often cut away before the kiss or show people flirtatiously chasing each other around trees, etc. instead of kissing. The actors and filmmakers chose to show respect for Indian culture and help guarantee that Indian audiences accept the film."" 

http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/lion/

Looping in /u/Oddquery as well. Omg, I wish I didn't read this, fuck, I'm gonna be thinking about this a lot from now on :'( This happened in Slumdog Millionaire as well, right? Also starring Dev Patel.  holy shit I think thats what the guy in white that he met at that womans apartment was going to do. yeesh No. To use them to beg for money in places like  Thanks! Oh ok, that's sweet Their life was also really hard. I assume he only felt it was worth living because he always had his brother with him Their mother wasnt mad at him. That scene was Saroo imagining what must've happened when he never returned. Either in the book, the movie, or both, he says neither brother ever returned that day. Gaddu went missing the same day as Saroo.  That's odd. I thought the film said he was hit by a train the same day Saroo got lost. I figured Guddu returned, freaked out, went to search for Saroo on the tracks, got careless and got hit by a train. But we don't actually know if he was shouting for him at the station. We don't know if he even returned for Saroo. Maybe that's why he never came back and Saroo was in his own, because Guddu had been killed. Just try to help one. A little bit of money in the right hands does go a long way in developing countries, and there are some great charities. i sure am. amazing album.  The movie made it obvious that she knew. After he sized saroo up, Rama whispered to Noor something along the lines of ""You've done well, he's exactly what they're looking for"". It was also a scene that shown the realization on Saroo's face that they aren't to be trusted. Thanks! Yeah, in the movie it seemed like they tried to portray it as if Noor had genuine intentions. Yeah, that's really horrible.
It's too bad because it felt as if Noor was taking care of Saroo with motherly love. One would expect someone involved in that sort of trade to not be the most genuine and tender with children 9 million prostitutes in Kolkata and a couple of labourers and a college student and his girlfriend at cafe coffee day, yeah? Older Saroo was also characteristic of younger Saroo, but (rather quickly) his past crept into memories and he descended into depression.  My understanding was that he was taken by the man for sexual purposes because he was like ""just bring him back by morning"" or something like that
I may be way off though.  I'm not sure how close it is to reality but in the book Saroo explains that Mantosh was one of the unlucky kids that was physically and sexually abused on the streets.  It's alot smaller and quieter, other than that the same  without ruining the book, because i plan to read it, do we learn more about his adopted brother? I was really curious about that Fuck me, it's just a sad movie.  >
It's pretty fucking gut wrenching if you have a soul or any sort of compassion for people. 

I did not think it was gut wrenching. It could have but some odd choices made me almost laugh than cry (Saroo hugging his mother went on for too long and was just repetitive and ruined the scene's emotion punch, and then there was the shitty pop song at the end and the score was too heavy handed at times) .  > -He's probably been beaten and left somewhere. Too much of a headache for those running the orphanage

I disagree - I think that man was going to sexually abuse him, and has been for some time. The fact that Shondeep had clearly been driven insane by something, broken, smashing his head against the wall, and the ""bring him back by the morning"" suggest to me that this was just another regular episode of sexual exploitation, that the guards had been paid off to facilitate...that scene really got me. How common is child kidnapping in India? But the guard does say ""Bring him back before morning ""  The movie finally opened in Germany and those were exactly my thoughts. Up to this point I loved the score, with its nuanced, heartfelt piano and string pieces but amazingly still fitting in an Indian setting.
But the moment the song starts, and you hear the enhanced bass of the beat, it was over.
It doesn't even comparably sound like Indian music plus the lyrics felt way over the top and on the nose, like ""enough of those heavy thoughts and feelings you got there mate, here are some happy pictures, smile, lets dance"" what in the world.
The movie tried hard to not be cheesy, especially at the end, just to go full on Mozzarella mode at the end.
A movie's score is a major part of my movie experience, and that ending was a masterclass in how not to end a movie, sigh.
But otherwise, still love that movie. I think it's emphasizes the fact that it was an emotional movie, since guys are known as tough and blabla Very good point.  The worst was when it went to that shot of a police guard just standing there smoking his cigarette. I knew he wasn't going to do anything about it but really hoped he would. And the kidnapper literally runs right passed him wtf. so I'm from pakistan my dad was born in india. I can tell you honestly that those small towns are not really even towns, mapped, or recognized in some cases. Basically like small shanty villages and a country that large it would literally be impossible for someone to locate it. Also i can assure you no one there gave a shit about finding that kid his home.  Excuse my ignorance but isn't Ganesh a deity or something? Or at least a pretty widely known word/name? When I saw the movie I thought ""Hmm the police man really could have at least narrowed it down with the relatively clear **Ganesh** that the little kid said."" Agreed. If anything I would have loved to see more of him trying to fit in with the other Indian students and realising he didn't. Would like to see an extended directors cut of it with more content yeah

sheesh or even a workprint I agree. I didn't care at all for their relationship, it felt forced. And I don't understand why everyone needs resolution with the Mantosh storyline. If we were given closure for that it would've just been another tired trope. Thanks.   That's a shame. I'm sure the book is wonderful and the filmmakers had a hard time translating his internal struggle. This movie sort of explains in a bit more detail. Maybe not the random guys catching the kids on the street. I think Slumdog Millionaire touched on that. But Salaam Bombay is definitely worth a watch. For further info, documentaries would be the best. I'm going to hunt some down myself! We don't know if he was actually there searching for Saroo, that's just in Saroo's head. I took it as he died that night, which is why he never came back. That was just Saroo imagining his brother looking for him I believe he committed suicide by jumping in front of a running train. Yeah I think Mara was fine with what she was given but I agree that it was just a plot device type role. Thanks, that's a shame I really like Mara. One of the actors is a fan of the channel and was seen very recently in a lot of their videos. He was a great sport and very funny and charismatic so I think at least few funhaus fans will check this out. Im gonna for sure, after all I only know about this movie because of funhaus. It could have been a good scene if they left it at that, but then she goes into how she saw ""a brown-skinned child standing in a field,"" and it was just really weird. When he is first introduced and he is having problems adjusting is my favourite part for Mantosh. He definetly needed more development because the film just made him out to be a bit of a prick for no reason.

To me he was a tragic character but just wasn't developed enough. ? When did he go MIA? Just was kind of distant lmao Not all guys are Chad. The kids were raped??? When?? Right sold might be wrong word. Traded or given or whatever. Merely trying to say he also seemed to be a victim of sex slavery.  [And the cop who just watched as the guys carried off the kids and chased Saroo..](#spoiler) :/ The funny thing that's what his mother described the ""vision"" in the book.  I agree. I don't think the director understand the average middle-class, middle-aged Australian parent. They're just not this melodramatic. There's no indication in the book that Sue was anywhere near the deep depression portrayed in the film, or the denial about Mantosh. don't you mean treeky? Best Australian accent by a non-Australian I've heard in film. Most people can't get the vowels right. To be fair that's probably the most watched Australian media outside of Australia.  I definitely understand what you're saying. I thought the movie depicted issues of adoption. One child who attached well to his adoptive parents and another who didn't. Either way, I hope Mantosh gets the chance to tell his own story.  Yeah, imagine coming out of rehab to that. Hopefully things get better for him. And if he ever gets to the point where he's comfortable opening up about it, I'd love to hear his story more in depth. [deleted] I know, I know. I'm just getting at if the guy were a good dude he would have complained about the movie's portrayal and if he was a bad dude he would complained about the movie's portrayal

I'm getting into dumb semantics here  Correct, that scene only existed in adult Saroo's head. Guddu was killed by the train that night, which is why he didn't return for Saroo. Yes, Sunny Pawar! No training, and no English, but an absolute star.

You have to see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIuylgTfEo4) if you haven't already. Ya dude. Definitely something along the lines of spending all those years looking for a brother he knew for 5 years 25 years ago vs the brother he has known for 25 years. I'm not a writer but they could have ran a good plot line with that as I recall (and I may be wrong) but in the movie, the mother scolds the brother for not looking out for him, but according to the scrolling trailing facts, the brother dies that night at or near the station. *Hindi is the language. Hindu refers to the religion.  I saw the part about his real name but like I skimmed it so was like 'hah he mispronounced his name' then I saw 'Lion' pop up on screen I was like...ok...yep. That's the name of the movie. Normally don't see that at the end of movies. I GET IT NOW. Thank you!! I should read those things more carefully. Ohhhh right gotcha ;)  St Kilda as in along the beach? I thought that was in Tassie! Memory is hazy as well. I'm also trying to pinpoint which shopping centre they were in when Dev bumped into Rooney though. Yes, I really enjoyed the book, too. Definitely recommend it. I'm astounded by how much he remembers from his life before he got lost. You will see that events happened a little differently for him in real life but the movie was pretty close to it. And yes, there is more about his relationship with not just Guddu, but his other brother and sister too. Enjoy! I haven't seen the film but there is a fair bit about the brother that was with him the night he got lost.  The book is great, I would recommend reading it if you hadn't have mentioned the kallu line in the film i would have continued to not remember it.  i can see for the sake of the film having to trim, but it seems disrespectful to all but eliminate kallu from ""existing"" to the audience/story. Know this is a super late reply but I just saw Lion for the first time.

I wondered about that line. I initially assumed it was his mum's name but thought it was strange he wouldn't just call her 'mum'. Second billing in a movie that'll get rave reviews.  It's not really considered taboo anymore. Many high profile actors and actresses (it's always worse press for women) have had on screen kisses in the last 20 years or so.  Interesting, thanks for posting.  Hey if it helps there are a lot of NGOs working to rehabilitate these kids.  I myself have worked with quite a few and the joy you see on their faces for the simplest of things is heart warming Ignorance is bliss. You'll never be able to change anything if you ignore everything wrong with the world Yep yeah if you go to markets or heavily conjested areas in towns or cities in india you'll see groups of young children, some mutilated or dismembered begging for money. There are actual gangs that do that to the children and then collect their money  I just saw this today, I assumed that his death was the reason he never returned to get Saroo. He said he'd 'be right back' and then crosses a bunch of tracks. I figured he died on the way back and never returned to Saroo.

I also considered the suicide issue, especially since they show that scene where his mother is so angry at Guddu for not watching Saroo. Maybe he felt so much shame and fear over losing his brother that he laid in front of a train. I like this version of the story. It makes me feel better. Thank you so much! I was trying to find a track in the Lion soundtrack, and sure enough, it's in Atomos (""Atomos XII"")! It's weird because it appears as a motif in ""Memories"" in the soundtrack. Ya... she appeared to have good intentions at first, but she must have known what this guy was up to, especially after he lay down in bed with Saroo and stroked him. We do Hmm, yes. There are many plausible scenarios, and I guess the users are not shown definitively what exactly was going to happen to him.  I am guessing Shondeep was autistic.  That was my guess as well If you're one of those homeless-orphan kind off children, theb I guess it is fairly common. Otherwise, it's rare.

Mostly, these idiots kidnap them and use them in begging rings ec. I've also been told as a child by my parents thay they take children's organs out and sell them, but I guess they were just trying to scare me lol It could've have been so much better without the cheesy song, the love interest that didn't fit in, and the montage scenes where he uses google earth. Yeah I know what he's trying to say. It's just wrong.  I watched it with my family and all of us are Indians and no one was surprised at the least, because we know the amount of corruption the cops are involved in. 
The cop in the movie (and in real life) was probably involved with the trafficking scene himself. Ganesh is a deity. But we are talking about a SMALL neighbourhood in the city of Khandwa. There's hundreds of such neighbourhoods. My parents, who were both born and raised in India (Calcutta), have no flipping idea about the different neighbourhoods in Calcutta, let alone the rest of India. Also, Saroo was probably just another lost kid to the police man. I think you should also factor in the impact of having so many languages in India. When you say the officer could've recognised Ganesh, the way it is said in Bengali will sound different from how it's pronounced from where Saroo was from. The man in the restaurant actually picked him up because he realised Saroo didn't understand Bengali. Rooney Mara's character was based on several different relationships he had while searching for his family. Since it's based on a true story, I guess they wanted to include that part of his life/journey. Totally agree, normally I appreciate when movies keep their runtime in the ballpark of 2 hours, but this was actually a movie I wanted to see more of. The huge time jump was so jarring, and as a result it made much of the drama in the second act feel kind of suddenly manufactured.  

Really enjoyed all the scenes in India, though. By far the best parts of the film.  It sounds like City of God, which if you haven't seen I highly highly recommend I'd watch it for Dev, Kidman, and the younger Saroo.  Damn I guess I missed those videos. Which ones is he in? How so? Not baiting you, just genuinely curious. 

Is it because she brought the child's race into it?  He could've been further developed, but this is Saroo's story so it's not that big of a deal. he took off to go live in a boat or some shit.  woosh When they took the kid that banged his head against the wall at night. They said something along the lines of ""bring him back in the morning"".  [deleted] That's good to know (I haven't read the book)...but to me, that's the job of the writer for a film...take the truth, and make it better when necessary ;) No >I thought it was just a regular cigarette.

It looked hand-rolled (it didn't have the tan-coloured part commercial cigarettes have), but yeah, I think they left it ambiguous in the end. There was definitely a bong or a meth pipe or something visible in the second visit to his home.

>And weed isn't exactly hardcore drugs.

I don't think any reviewers have suggested they are (although it is arguably problematic if you're constantly getting high to escape emotional problems, and withdrawing from daily life as a result), but in the movie, marijuana use was just part of a greater problem including alcohol abuse and harder drugs. 

Even if true to life, that's a tough thing for Mantosh to see on screen - if not true, it's even harder, especially seeing Sue and Saroo on red carpets posing with Nicole Kidman. I hope things turn out well for him too.  That's okay, I love dumb semantics. Do we know that for sure? Based on the text, I assumed that Guddu died after Saroo already got on the train, but I'm guessing no one can say either way. Saroo admits he doesn't know how long he was asleep for it, minutes or hours. This is cute but family guys version was funnier. https://youtu.be/xBlwchTCHV0 THANK YOU OMG [deleted] TIL Thanks fam. More like between St Kilda and Windsor. Could've sworn it was shot some point along Dandenong road.  Aw snap I'll definitely check it out!

As someone with no expectations going into the movie, it was really good- you should check IT out! That's really good of you, I hope one day I have enough money to help. Thanks for what you do. All of us get caught up in our own lives and we forget about everyone else. People like you constantly try to make a better world for the less privileged  >  Maybe he felt so much shame and fear over losing his brother that he laid in front of a train.

That would make sense had he found Saroo dead, but I don't see why he would come to the point of killing himself without even knowing what happen to Saroo.  Something (or someone) is only lost once you've stopped looking for it. My guess was undocumented medical testing I seem to be one of the only ones who liked the romance. It was a plot device yes, but the relationship itself was not plastered over the story, rather going along in the background, we don't see there first kiss and the leading up to it for example, giving Lion another perspective apart from the family one. It's really not though. In an ideal world, yes, you're right, but don't pretend that men aren't conditioned from birth to show less emotion than women. What's really surprising is that there's no repository of those neighbourhoods anywhere. Even if there were 10,000 names to go through in the Gs, it would still not take too long before finding it going through a thousand names a day. If Google had the information, then certainly it must come from somewhere... I'll check it out, Thanks! It was just weird. Not because she brought the child's race in, but that adds to it. Just the fact that she had a vision was weird. Even if she just said ""I saw a child standing at the edge of a field,"" it would've been off-putting still. melbourne for hotel management Link is dead.. You sure about that?  Absolutely agree, found it awkward in the book and found it awkward in the movie. Ah, I assumed Guddu died *before* Saroo got on the train, based on this...

>Guddu hadn't come home either after that night I was lost. My mother found out a few weeks later that he had died in a train accident. She had lost two sons on the same night.

...but you're right, we can't know for sure. The book later says:

>He might have assumed I went home, but he never went back to check, so it was hard not to think that if I hadn't boarded the train  that night, Guddu might have returned as planned and he'd still be alive now...I understood that I would have to accept I could never know the truth of what happened to my brother. Thank you.  Indeed that was one possibility I was thinking, that it was a memory/dream thing. Yeah I was leaning more towards an accident, hence why he never came back to get Saroo.  But the suicide thing did cross my mind. I think it just added something that wasn't really needed. They could have featured more of his brother or more of his childhood. I thought that was Saroo who went to Melbourne for Hotel Management?

Mantosh was just cutting about in his trailer. Oh yes I forgot which character they were talking about since that was 3 weeks ago.

Don't take MIA literal. You know what I meant. She gave him shit for going in hiding when he was consumed with his search.  That wasn't even a proper link wtf:

https://www.reddit.com/s

Is this guy a troll? I don't know about you. To me it was so revealing. Up until that point, I had no clue why she adopted those kids. My immediate assumption was, ok, she can't bear a child, then my second question was even if she can't bear a child, why adopt from India, why not from Australia. Her explanation of vision connected the dots and I felt complete and satisfying. God bless those couple for doing such a noble thing. [deleted] The part where he is scolded is a memory that happened before the train station, when he is hit by the motorbike. I think it was mostly to show that he had a lot of good things going for him in aus. Therefore making everything that much harder for him. And making him feel that much more conflicted about his identity.  Correct but op was referring to saroo I think  gotcha gotcha understood Yeah, I had it chalked up to infertility, but that vision gave a solid backstory. Yeah, that's definitely possible. I assumed that because Saroo woke up in the dark and Guddu wasn't there, it must have been some time later than it *should* have been, indicating that Guddu's death was what prevented him from coming sooner. But even that is just Saroo's hazy memory. He also thought the train journey was much, much shorter than it was, so he couldn't really know how long Guddu had been gone.

So sad that poor children can be so anonymous in places like that. ",1
105,"Yeah, I'd have jumped out of that fucking window too. anyone else think the scene where toni and her son are arguing and suddenly their both wet with paint thinner really intense What about the gallery opening though When Peter goes into shock after the accident, parks the car, and goes to his bed, I got this intense, awful feeling that I was going to have to witness the discovery of Charlie's body. I didn't want them to show it. I wanted that whole scene to be over. And I maintained that feeling as the camera stayed on Peter's frozen face in bed, hearing Annie leave the house, and eventually the scream. It was terrible and unnerving. Did anybody else notice the moment where Joanie said ""Every member of the family has to be in the house"", they ADR'd ""house"" over her originally saying ""room""? Everyone talking about Toni Collette’s performance (and rightly so)... but damn if Alex Wolff doesn’t deserve as much praise...the aftermath of the accident, getting owned at the dinner table... a very commendable performance all round

Edit: Fuck it ... I thought everyone was great in this actually.. Gabriel Byrne with the F bombs was some much needed levity I knew Charlie was no good when she ate the Hershey’s bar like a fucking psycho.  This movie is the greatest anti pot PSA ever Toni Collette was giving me some serious Shelly Duvall a la The Shining vibes. The pure terror and raw feeling when she’s standing at the foot of Peter’s bed during her sleep walking dream was so captivating and also so horrifying! The poor dad was so concerned with it being cold and people being chilly and then dies from being set on fire. At least the cold can't bother him or his loved ones now.  Did anyone else think Peter was going to have his eyes gouged out? There seemed to be a lot of imagery hinting at that. Paraphrasing here:

TEACHER (O.S.): ""The hero's tragic end comes down to his own fatal flaw...""

PETER'S POV: Staring at girl's ass.

LATER IN THE MOVIE:

Follows same girl to smoke a bowl, thereby setting in motion all of the events leading to his own ultimate downfall. Virtually the entire movie was a r/MovieDetails landmine. Major spoilers ahead, with various degrees of obviousness vs. subtlety, but all details that I've noticed other Redditors questioning:

-  Ellen's supposedly schizophrenic husband died of starvation, and her son killed himself after claiming that his mother was trying to ""put people inside him."" In this way, the plot starts very much before the movie does, and Ellen and the cult have been working steadily before Annie's family enters the picture.

- On this ""plot starts before the movie does"" note, Annie did not allow Ellen much time or contact with Peter when he was born. The mother and daughter relationship was, as Annie describes in the grief counseling, ""not talking, then talking, then not talking"" (light paraphrasing here).

- Following this, Ellen was apparently allowed to have a very close relationship with Charlie, who was ""her favorite.""

- One figurine scene throughout the movie shows Ellen watching in on Annie and her husband having sex / sleeping together. This might be a reference to the next point:

- Annie tried to have a miscarriage with Peter, but it didn't work, consistently. Her mother insisted that she have the child, which she must have wanted as a vessel for Paimon.

Flash Forward to the Present:

- Ellen's funeral is full of strangers, who were the cult members. One of them, the smiling blonde man, is seen later in the house during the final 30 minutes of the movie.

- Charlie foreshadows the decapitation ritual with the pigeon head.

- The telephone pole that decapitated Charlie had the cult insignia on it.

Edit 2:

- Back to the party, the teenagers in one room watched a decapitation video, foreshadowing what was going to happen to Charlie.

- A note on the accident. The biggest criticism I've seen of the plot is that the cultists couldn't have predicted that the accident. Two things on this: (A) Paimon is the demon prince of wisdom and foresight, who can gift all knowledge, secrets  and mystery. So yes, they probably could have known. (B) The cultists aren't blueprinting this entire scenario. They're preparing it. The cult insignia on the telephone pole is all the evidence that they were involved.

- When Annie goes to Joanie's house and we see the inside of Joanie's apartment, there are multiple strange toys / dolls similar to the ones Charlie used to make. Very weird. I don't want to read too far into this, but I seriously question if Charlie was ever a child or if it was always Paimon

- Both Joanie and Ellen have black triangles in their rooms. Joanie's has a picture of Peter in it, leading me to believe that Ellen could have been using hers against the family (from inside the house) prior to the start of the film.

Edit 3:

- The kneeling pose Annie is in upon witnessing Charlie's death is the same one she kneels in at the end of the film, in the tree house.

- Charlie notes that Ellen wanted her to be a boy  and Annie tells her how Ellen would insist on being the one to feed her. Ellen, then, was nursing Charlie to be a vessel for Paimon.

MAJOR EDIT:

I'm convinced that Charlie was always inhabited /possessed by Paimon, and that the only time we ever saw the ""real"" Charlie was when she possessed Annie. Hear me out:

- Charlie was Ellen's ""favorite,"" and was in regular contact with her as a baby.

- Charlie asks Annie who will take care of her after she (Annie) dies. I believe this is a nod to Paimon inhabiting Charlie in the present day.

- We hear from the final few lines of the movie that Charlie was the original, intended host, but that she was not sufficient.

- ""Charlie"" makes the same kinds of demented toys and figurines that the cultist Joanie has on her kitchen table.

- ""Charlie"" cuts off the head of the pigeon. Later, it is shown that ""Charlie"" has drawn a picture of the pigeon head wearing a crown  (a nod to Paimon, Prince of Hell).

- This crowned pigeon head drawing is a dark foreshadowing to the final idol we see in the treehouse, which is the crowned, decapitated and rotten head of Charlie herself.

- Charlie's voice, tone, and attitude are very different before her death vs. when she possesses Annie. There is a very noticable franticness and helplessness, as she cries out in confusion.

Edit 5

- The way Peters arm contorted in class is the same way that the idol's hand contorts in the treehouse. me during the first 90 minutes: This is a great slow-burn, Rosemary's Baby-meets-The Exorcist kind of movie.

me during the last thirty minutes: stop the ride I'm going to die. She drew me retarded The shot of Charlie's head in the road with ants on it will stay with me forever.  That car scene just about destroyed my life. You didn’t hear? Decapitated. Whole big thing... we had a funeral for a bird. 

EDIT: Gold? You shorn't have <3 [deleted] Shout out to big pharma for making epi pens too expensive to keep on hand.  People seem to be arguing over whether Hereditary is a more of a traditional horror film or a psychological thriller but I personally think it's a groundbreaking addition to the ""fucking upsetting"" genre of film. As a fan of this genre I was not disappointed.  This movie went from 0-100 real quick with Peter and Charlie in the car What unnerved me the most was the brief shot of Annie on the ceiling, beating her head into the attic door after Peter locked himself in. I'll be seeing that on my head when I go to sleep tonight Did anyone notice that when Peter was in the attic and Annie was banging her head on the attic door, that she immediately stopped after he said ""I'm sorry""? I found that kind of cool since she had been waiting for him to apologise for Charlie's death for a long time.  Who else had idiots clicking in their theatre? One of the most disturbing parts or this movie that I see nobody mentioning is when Annie is trying to channel Charlie through the medium and then Charlie physically takes over Annie's body and is becoming confused and disoriented before Steve throws water on her......the acting in that scene was scary good. What an amazing directorial debut by Ari Aster. There's a shot where it shows a pile of mail in the mail slot. The mail has already been delivered. Then someone slips a pamphlet ontop of the already delivered mail. The pamphlet was to go and see a psychic medium presented to skeptics. The same experience we were told by Joan later on.

The cultists tried to get her to go to the psychic through mail and when that failed they had Joan ""accidentally"" bump into her at the arts and crafts store. Here’s a cool lil thing I haven’t seen anyone mention yet. Written on the wall in one of the scenes prior to the final act was, “Liftoach Pandemonium” Liftoach is Hebrew for “open”. Interesting little detail there.  From the point of view of the demon worshippers, this would be a damn good heist film. Am I the only one who saw that when Peter blew smoke out the window something blew smoke back? Like they were watching him?  Quick explanation of the how I saw the events of the film connecting together (friends of mine were confused, so maybe this will help anyone in a similar situation):

The grandma was the leader and founder of the cult, and they needed a host for Paimon. Originally, the grandmother wanted to place Paimon into her own son, Annie’s brother, but he killed himself before Paimon was able to take control, so the grandmother’s next plan was to place Paimon within Annie’s son, but Peter was kept away from her as a child, so she had to place Paimon within Charlie. 

Paimon was always within Charlie, but couldn’t take full control of a female host, that’s why grandma wanted Charlie to be a boy. Peter was the intended host but was kept away from the grandmother, so she was unable to “give” Paimon to him (likely done through the breast milk of the grandmother, which is why she insisted on feeding Charlie). Paimon/the cult then hatched the plan to have Peter inadvertently kill Charlie, which released Paimon while simultaneously bringing Peter to his most vulnerable state, which was one of the conditions needed for Paimon to possess him. Paimon was embodied by the blue light which traveled from Charlie, to the notebook, to Annie, and ultimately to Peter, who then became Paimon after jumping out of the window.  I felt really bad for the husband. He was an all-around great husband and father figure. Did his best to protect his child, put food on the table, was supportive of his wife's career. He clearly had doubts in their marriage and fidelity when it came to his wife sneaking out and sleeping in a separate bed. Amidst of all the chaos, he really pushed his patience with his wife to the very end of what he witnessed as a schizophrenic psychosis, only to be burned alive. He was such an innocent, caring man, who unfortunately married the girl with a cult queen mother-in-law... I know my heart was beating through a lot of the intense scenes, but Toni Collette’s scream after realizing what happened to Charlie really got me I know this is minor in a film filled with little clues and symbols, but I was curious if anybody else noticed this. When Annie was trying to console Charlie at night, Charlie was wearing a white fleece jacket that looked like lamb's wool. Seems symbolic of Charlie being the sacrificial lamb.  What about how the first shot of the movie the camera moves into the doll house where it ""comes alive"" and the last shot of the movie the camera shows just the cutout of the tree house where everything alive looks miniature and isn't moving?

Are we meant to believe that all of this is self-referential? That it's all a miniature? And what about her destroying the miniatures right before the movie's climax, was she destroying her own world, literally? During the last 40 minutes the guy next to me told his girlfriend “Imma have to go to church after this”. God damn, I got so much out of this, especially after a second viewing

* the video the two teens were watching at the party was someone being decapitated with a guillotine, foreshadowing the next few minutes
* the way Joan begins grasping onto Anne outside the counseling session reminded me a bit of Pennywise talking to Georgie, when she goes “my son is dead” there’s this genuine desperation in her voice, and as she says it her hands reach further into the car. Maybe I’m just reading too far into it but it spooked me good
* Towards the end when Peter hears the piano crash, we see it destroyed later, the string that was pulled out was what Annie used to cut her head off.

Fuck I love this movie. The cinematography, acting, pacing, and scares are all A+. Can’t wait to watch it a third time. That scene at the end where Annie is sawing her head off like some sort of puppet is going to give me nightmares.  The final set up shot of the house where it turns from night to early day with the naked cultists in the background creeped me out so much. 

This film was really great, I hate how badly I want to watch it again given how much it terrified me lol.  The king/queen at the end with with metal body and the crown, that was Charlie’s head, yeah? I didn't see the ending coming at all. I truly expected the mother to sleepwalk and kill her family. It was such a strange direction to take but it was well foreshadowed so it didn't feel cheap. I loved that so many of the people from the funeral showed up at the end, especially the smiling man. Creeped me right the fuck out that it was all in front of me the whole time.

It even made something as cheesy as a ""reflection not matching reality"" scene fresh and scary.

9/10, very much like Rosemary's Baby, The Shining, Lords of Salem, The VVitch, Suspiria, House of the Devil, etc. Peter and his mother’s reaction to Charlie’s death was so *believable* and so *haunting* “DONT YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE AT ME; I AM YOYR MOTHER!” 
Chills down my spine.  This is the most I've ever been truly rattled by a horror movie in the theater.

 I'm exhausted and terrified and don't even know of what. The unsung hero of this movie is the gallery owner who called to check up on the family and just couldn't have been more sweet about accommodating Annie during this difficult time. I hope Paimon doesn't come back to haunt you kind sir!  Theory: Grandpa was inhabited by paimon, but starved himself to kill the demon.  The way this movie fucked with audience expectations and used foreshadowing was brilliant.

EG:

-The randomly edited shot of viciously chopping walnuts right before they get to the party that only gains significance 10 minutes later

-Annie casually mentioning at her first Grief support group meeting that her brother hung himself at 16 because **he thought his mother was trying to put people inside of his body**

-The entire misdirection with Charlie used in the marketing.

Ultimately I think all of the mythos and supernatural elements undermine the inherently powerful family drama onscreen in the first half of the movie a bit, but in so many ways this thing was maliciously clever. One thing that some people may have missed, when Annie is looking through the occult books and sees a picture of Paimon, he is carrying three heads. This explains the importance of beheading the family members. What a great theater experience. I didn't see her in the corner of the room until I heard someone say ""Oh shit"" in the audience and I immediately jumped as soon as I noticed  Is it possible Annie was somehow more aware of the Satanic shit when sleep walking? This would mean she may have tried to kill Peter on purpose to protect him from what was coming. Just an idea, may not have any merit. rip to steve the dad he didn’t deserve that The car scene where the girl is beheaded is now my favourite horror scene of all time, it was masterful. From the slow build up of seeing the nuts, her hyperventilating, the thwack of the pole, the resistance of looking in the rear view mirror, and finally Toni Collettes wailing/shrieking. It was unbelievably shocking. I've got one for you guys.... the tree house... WAS A DECAPITATED ROOF OF A HOUSE...  Damn credits just rolled. Toni’s character hiding in certain shots freaked me the fuck out along with the lack of any music when the body floated to the tree house. Lots to process, wild.  
The drama and execution of the horror was brilliant. The constant dread paying off to the last 30 minutes was handled like a master of the craft.

That last segment in the house has some of the most terrifying horror imagery I've ever seen.



The shot of Annie behind Peter on the ceiling when he wakes up froze me and had me nearly pissing myself, as well as the shot of the naked figure he sees at the doorway. 

The use of framing and lighting in this film was pitch perfect.

The ending is a little conventional for the style of horror, but wow was it just unnerving.

Also, no one in the theater mentioned the people surrounding the house after  Steve was burned alive during the day to night shift of the property.

 Annie mentions that her brother killed himself after he blamed his mom for putting people in his body. Was he the initial choice for the host? Spoiler question: so in the grief counseling scene, Anne describes that she wasn’t speaking to her mother when Peter was born and let her back into her life when Charlie was born. She said that she immediately sank her hooks in and wouldn’t even let Anne feed Charlie. Now later when she “scared herself” in the workshop and turned around the diorama was that her mother feeding Charlie while Anne protested? 

To me it looked like an older woman breastfeeding while the younger woman still had her breast out. That would make sense why Charlie was so different right?

I don’t think there was a wasted shot or line, incredible movie.  Another thing I’d like to mention; did anybody else feel like all the establishing wide shots of the house & the woods looked a WHOLE lot like the miniature set-pieces? And the fact that every transition from day to night or night to Day was instant, almost like a switch being flipped? It felt like the whole thing could have taken place in Annie’s workshop. I don’t think that’s the case; I just think it’s a cool motif Aster used to facilitate a sense of disassociation and unease. It DEFINITELY had the “uncanny valley” effect on me. What about you guys?  This was absolutely incredible. I just really want to sing praises for Alex Wolff, a complete knockout. His reaction to Charlie’s death had me fucking FLOORED.  That shot of the head on the side of the road

thats gonna stick with me for a long time. Christ. Something I noticed was when that paint is “knocked” over by Annie, her hand actually never touched it. It seemed to fall over by itself and the resulting spill of paint got onto the paper where Joan’s contact details were. Seems like another hint of a higher power involved, getting Annie to make the first visit to Joan.  I really liked that statue they had next to the staircase that depicted the house and then the houses below it underground. Its almost symbolic of their household descending into hell. Props to whoever cut those trailers to make it seem like a creepy little kid movie and not what it really was.  Was incredible to go into something relatively blind  This movie intensely, intensely disturbed me. I consume a lot of dark media, and some of the things in this film will stay with me for a long time. This is going to be a classic. 

My favorite parts: 

1. The foreshadowing at the funeral with the people. Annie mentioning how she doesn’t recognize them and that her mother had private interests. 

2. Annie seeing her mother’s apparition after discovering her cult books. 

3. Annie’s discussion of the mental illness in her family, specifically her mentioning that her brother thought her mother was “putting people inside him.” I thought this was very good characterization and spoke volumes about the trauma Annie had been put through. 

4. The post and the entire sequence where Charlie died. I felt SO uncomfortable and worked myself up. I had to tell myself it was fiction, just a movie. The sight of her decapitated head on the side of the road coupled with her mother’s screams absolutely gutted me, and I don’t think I’ll forget it. 

5. The entire sequence in the treehouse. Just absolutely so grim and creepy. Leaves you feeling like you’ve jolted awake from a nightmare. 

I really think this movie had great moments. The final act was mind-bending for me, but I plan on seeing it again and trying to make better sense of it. I almost wish they’d kept it more mental health oriented, because the hallucinations your own mind can conjure are endlessly terrifying without the whole cult member sequence. But I understand why they did that, and I do enjoy the ending. 

Toni’s performance is standout. The whole monologue in the kitchen when her eyes get wilder and wilder and the pitch of her voice really scared me. Honestly, all of the performances in this are earnest and affecting. 

Go see this!  The horror aspects are terrifying but it’s definitely a slow burn. Toni Collette is amazing though.  I legitimately don't understand how people don't think this movie was scary. The tense atmosphere compounded with the last hour of the movie were brutal. I know nut allergies can be a big deal but come on... it's nothing to lose your head over. This movie was just straight evil. My theory: Paimon can only transfer hosts through decapitation and carries the souls of those he has captured with him.

Grandma, the host of Paimon, dies. Cult digs up the grave and decapitates her, freeing Paimon. 
Paimon occupies the body of a pidgeon which seeks out Charlie. Charlie had been groomed and breastfed by grandma and was the next obvious host for Paimon. Charlie decapitates the bird. Paimon then occupies the body of Charlie. 

The cult members want a male host and scheme to transfer Paimon into Peter's body. They put their mark on the telephone pole where Charlie is then decapitated. Traumatized, Peter keeps driving and does not look once at the backseat. The first person to find Charlie is Annie, who is then possessed by Paimon in her moment of vulnerability as she cries for her daughter. Annie screams that she must kill herself, the pain is unbearable. Annie always had an intuitive compulsion to kill her children, as she subconsciously wanted to destroy potential hosts for Paimon. With Paimon inside her, she feels compelled to destroy herself.

Annie meets Joan who coordinates the transferral of Paimon from Annie to Peter. Annie is able to conjur the spirit of Charlie because Paimon carries the souls of those he has captured. Unbeknownst to the fam, Annie carries more souls than just Charlie's. Paimon begins taking increasing control of the increasingly vulnerable Annie.

In the attic, Annie cuts off her head, freeing Paimon's spirit and the souls of those he has captured. Paimon follows Peter out the window, finally arriving into the male form he desired. Carrying the spirit of Charlie, Paimon, and the other past hosts, Peter makes the same clicking sound as his sister.

TLDR; Each time we see a decapitation, the spirit of Paimon is transferred to the next most vulnerable host, carrying with him the captured souls of the previous hosts. 
Grandma > pigeon > Charlie > Annie > Peter I had a HORRIBLE crowd for this movie. People were restless. Couple behind us were chatting, giggling and sniffing loudly from the beginning of the movie. People were talking, making that noise the little girl made. Is it difficult to be quiet or something? I feel like this kind of behaviour is expected in JUST horror films and its really upsetting.  * The horror elements were really good, but I think I enjoyed the drama stuff more. Like, if they cut out the supernatural stuff and this was just a straightforward drama about a family falling apart after the son accidentally kills the daughter that would have made a great movie, too.

* Super duper well-acted. Charlie's death would have been very easy to over or under act, but Wolff really knocked it out of the park. 

* Man, Steve didn't deserve this shit.

* I was expecting more of a ""is she crazy or is it paranormal"" plot. Kinda surprised we didn't get more of that or more of the girl Peter was crushing on.

* Well directed, good production values, creepy music, etc. Those miniatures must have been a pain in the ass.

Overall pretty dang good. I think the ending might make or break the movie for some people, though. Did not realize it was gonna be a Satanic movie of sorts. Those always freak me out. 

Other than that, God damn that was a great movie. The atmosphere was absolutely terrifying. The scares were top notch. The body horror was disturbing af. Especially the scene where Annie was floating in the air and using the string to cut her neck. 

The scene where Charlie died was so fucking good. The way Peter just sat there not wanting to look back. Because he knew looking back would make it real. 

The last shot is my most favorite thing ever. It reminded me of the Birth of Jesus Christ. And I'm pretty sure that's what it was referencing. 

All in all, it lived up to the hype. 10/10. Am definitely going to watch it again. Wow. What an unconventionally horrifying film. 

Side note: I took my 13 year old brother to watch this and when Annie flew up into the treehouse, my brother leaned over to me and said ""come on, no no-clipping"" and it totally took me out of the scene for a second It seems most people are forgetting a very important scene in the movie. The scene where Annie goes to the grieving self help group and speaks about her family history. She reveals in this scene that her brother killed himself by hanging himself in his mother's room. He was actually the first attempt at summoning Paimon into a male host. The son couldn't handle it though. He says the mother put voices in his head and that why he killed himself. Annie never let the mom have access to Peter as a baby/child. She settled for Charlie years later. This is why the grandma was showered with gold in the one picture. She succeeded in conjuring Paimon into Charlie. [deleted] The plot choice to kill Charlie early and make that the crux of the first two acts was brilliant. Completely threw me for a loop, I thought her creepy ass was gonna be clucking her way throughout the whole movie (in between bites of chocolate, of course) Shit, you follow that poor girl around with a camera rolling for two hours, that’s basically a horror movie on its own

I’m never gonna hear tongue clucking and not think of this movie

As somebody else said, the shot of her head on the highway is basically indelible.

Sincere question- did Peter just drive home with her body just left in the backseat for his parents to find in the morning? The movie wasn’t clear on that. Let’s discuss that, oh, and the shot of him observing the aftermath of the decapitation while parked on the highway. Great bit of show not tell

Also, serious The vvirtch parallels with the ending.  That ending reminded me of the witch Every time I walk past places in my house that are dark, I cannot unsee the image of that naked man just... smiling.

Holy shit this movie has me paranoid now. 10/10 If you're really into an hour and 45 minutes of debilitating uneasiness and 15 minutes of abject terror, this is the goddamn movie for you So the smiling naked guy standing in the doorway staring at Peter was the creepy guy smiling at Charlie at the grandma’s funeral, right? Wow. Had a shitty theater experience but not even that could bring this down for me. 

From the impact in the car to the reveal of the uhhh ""remains"" were some of the most gut wrenching horror I've ever seen. Masterfully done IMO. There were some points where I was hoping it would wrap up but after it kept going I got sucked right back in. 

Not much I can complain about. As a big fan of horror, this was a treat. This was the first time I have seen mass walk outs during a movie. What an amazing film.  To the viewers who didn’t like the supernatural turn, the ending could be interpreted as non-supernatural imo. Joan and the cult believe that Paimon was successfully transferred to Peter. But like real life cults, what they believe isn’t necessarily true-just because they believe that Paimon is a real entity, doesn’t mean Paimon actually exists. Its not only the mother and son who could be suffering from delusions. 
At the ending scene, Peter just stares dazedly around, there’s nothing explicit that confirms or denies that he isn’t Peter anymore, other than Joan’s words, and the ghostly lights-which for all we know, could all be in Peter’s mind, just like all the strange things he witnesses throughout the film.

Paimon could be taken as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which hits men harder and earlier. It says it right there in the film title; the family has a history of mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, which is hereditary. Peter was at the age where the average onset occurs for men. That, combined with a traumatic trigger and all that pot jumpstarts his hallucinations. Of course, a supernatural interpretation is valid and makes sense as well but I think a non-supernatural interpretation is equally valid and believable. [The head in the road was definitely disturbing as was the heaad banging scene. But the one I found the most chilling was strangely the most human, and arguably the most realist: The sound of Annie's wails as she discovers her daughters body as Peter lays in bed in shock. Not only was that true horror, it was also pure cinematic tragedy as well.](#spoiler)

[Her models changing to violence and death had a particular nod to the Shining I loved too..](#spoiler) That's twice this year the theater has gone completely silent from shock. First the opening scene of A Quiet Place, now this with Charlie hitting that light pole. This movie was SO dang unsettling. I loved it. Toni Collette was phenomenal man I could NOT fucking sleep after watching this. It's so scary because half the scary shit is stuff you're afraid of irl (like seeing someone in the dark but it's just a weird shadow) so when that happens irl it just makes you think of the insane imagery from this movie. I went to the local cinema last night to get my mind off some unrelated life anxiety, and chose this. It made it so much worse... I know this may be a stretch of an idea but what based off what Joan was saying in the treehouse when it was peter up there with them worshipping Paimon and abandoning the trinity, I think that the events in the film weren’t a mental or psychological event but all the doings of the cult and Paimon. I have a few observations from watching it twice that I think all support this. 

1. When Charlie is at her grandmothers casket and looks to the right, there is a man who smiles at her. That same man is the one Peter sees in the doorway behind him after discovering his father’s burnt body. More people seen earlier in the film also appear naked at the house, which can be assumed to all be members of the cult that the grandmother led. 

2. I’m sure there are more scenes where this occurs but this is one I caught, but right before the paint falls over on Joan’s note in front of Annie, if you look behind her at the window you can see a flash of light just like the one that flies around throughout other parts of the film. This light being Paimon. 

3. This detail is pretty obvious, but Annie mentions her brother hanged himself after saying his mom “put people inside him”. This is because she was the head of the cult that tried to bring Paimon into the world with a male host. 

4. While it mentions that Paimon needs a male host, it also says Paimon can take control over the vulnerable. This is why it was able to be in Charlie but still needed to eventually take a male host. Also, right after the father burns to death, the light enters into the mother and her face goes blank. Obviously all the death she experienced makes her very vulnerable, and Paimon going into her is what allowed her to float and go through walls like she did. 

5. Another pretty obvious point, but still important was Joan’s ritual on her table in her house with the picture of peter. After we see that we see her expelling Peter and telling him to get out. This is because as a member of the cult she is trying to get Peter out to allow Paimon to take over. And when this happens he is temporarily taken over when he bashes his head against the desk. This helps show that it is both the cult itself and Paimon doing the work here. 

6. Finally, I think this is a bit more of a stretch but it makes complete sense, is that as a way of disrespecting the trinity, Paimon ensure that the Grandmother, Mother, and Daughter all end up without their heads in the end. Both the mother and Grandmother’s headless bodies are bent down worshipping Paimon in the end, and the head of Charlie is on the statue wearing the crown. The crown is then passed on to Peter who now is under the control of King Paimon. I don’t believe that them losing their heads was a necessary sacrifice, but a way of Paimon insulting the holy trinity. Because the trinity consists of the father, the son, and the Holy Ghost, while the three he killed are the mother, the daughter, and the grandmother (which led the cult to bring back Paimon so he may have potentially equated her to that). 

Anyways, I know most people probably won’t read this and it’s completely up to interpretation, but for me this is the explanation that makes the most sense for the events that conspired. I’ll be watching it again eventually to see if there’s anything else that supports this. Thanks for taking the time to read, and feel free to give your thoughts.

Edit: In the director's AMA today he stated the body of the grandmother was dug up and placed in the attic by members of the paimonist cult.  Someone posted a link earlier to the screenplay and I just wanted to note they left out a lot of things that clearly showed Annie does indeed have DID.  Steve is actually a psychiatrist and gives her pills.  She frequently says that she’s “lucid” to try to convince him she’s not making things up.  The movie did a good job of leaving little hints that this was the case - the sleepwalking and loss of time, but also the sticky note reminders she leaves herself.  This is a realistic coping skill used with DID.  But most telling us a cut scene close to the end where Steve invites her doctor (psychiatrist and colleague) over to their house to speak with her.  He begins a basic assessment for DID at the end of the scene, asking her what day it is and then what month.  She’s familiar with the process.  

“Sleepwalking” was always another identity coming through, and probably one completely aware of what was happening and trying to save her kids.  The sleepwalking scene where she keeps covering her mouth is probably that identity coming through and another identity trying to stop her (covering the mouth).

This movie is DEFINITELY about both mental illness and possession.  I think Paimon stays with this family because by their very nature/heredity they are extremely vulnerable.  Boom.  
 Charlies head on the side of the road with all the ants and her mouth split open is perhaps the most traumatizing image from the movie imo I thought it was interesting how Charlie cut off the head of the bird, and then in her book depicted that same bird head wearing a crown. At the end of the film, Peter’s character has a broken nose, effectively resembling a bird’s beak, as he is crowned. Anyone else notice that? Lol the 8th king of hell was allergic to peanuts Did anyone else have people in their theater just constantly laughing whenever something scary happened?  Of everything in the movie, I've got to say the tension and how it's held from scene to scene is probably my favorite part of it.

And the way the tension gets started! Oh. My. God. I don't think I've encountered a movie with the guts to go there. The reaction of Peter driving was so real and so unexpected at the same time. And then to not reveal the reality of the situation for so long after. The deliberate shadows. The camera work following his eyes away from the rear view mirror. And for that tension to finally be realized with Annie's scream while pulling into a closeup of Peter's eyes.

I wanted to stand up in the theater and start applauding right then and there. That's how you do horror. That's how you grab and audience's attention. No blood. No gore. I needed a cigarette after. I love horror movies but this was something beyond modern day horror. This movie truly defined horror and disturbing. The filmmaking was also superb and all around an astounding movie. Nothing like what I expected. Loved it. Go see it! What was the little black speck Annie found when trying to take a pill?

Also what was on the Grandma's lips at the funeral? This movie ruined me. Two days later and I still can't stop thinking about it. Something I thought about last night (while in bed, unfortunately): the absolute and sheer awfulness of what we didn't see, which was Peter driving the 20-30 minutes home, in complete silence, with the decapitated body in the car. Just the worst.  I signed on to reddit to talk about this film and read comments.

Kudos to this young director for having people discuss his film as if it were his third or fifth full length feature. It's his first, his first.

Always nice to see our youth stepping up and shaking up film expectations.

Neither here nor there I can tell this one is going to stick with me for quite a while. I just can't stop thinking about it. 

I will always enjoy seeing Toni Collette playing a burnt-out mother. 

The mom, dad, and son all portrayed deep-rooted anxiety *so* well. 

I absolutely loved the pacing and the slow-burn feel of it all. I have to say, though, there were maaaybe one or two parts where I felt myself thinking, ""OK....you can walk a little faster than that. This is overkill."" It was only a couple parts, but it really stuck out to me because I'm usually the person who is 100% onboard with that kind of pacing. 

Also, the movie did a really good job of dropping backstory on you *without* having some random character cheesily explain it toward the climax of the movie. Of course it came from a book, but still, I think they handled the explanation part well. 

Speaking of explanation, I think I get it. It didn't seem that convoluted, but I also think there were some key things that I missed. If anyone has a link to a good explanation thread, article, etc., I'm all ears.

I'm so pissed at the audience I saw it with, though. People were talking the *entire* time...and like, audibly. Not even whispering or trying to hide it. And before the credits even rolled, there's a ton of people doing the whole ""When is it gonna get scary?"" ""I want a refund"" bullshit...OUT LOUD...*DURING* THE MOVIE. 

And I'm so goddamn sick of smartwatches. People. Please. Every time you go to put popcorn or candy in your mouth, your smartwatch lights up like a christmas tree *right* in the face of teh person next to you. It's like a goddamn spotlight. 

WTF, people. Stop being assholes in theaters.  First things first, eliminate any notion of what Hereditary might be from your mind, because it probably isn't what you're expecting. It is a slow burn horror movie very much in the vein of Rosemary's Baby. If you go into it expecting it to go ""Boo!"" so that you can go ""Ah! Haha that was scary!"" then you'll be disappointed. I can anticipate many teens sneaking into it to go ""That was dumb""

The movie has fucked up imagery that is gorgeously shot, a layered plot and an Oscar worthy performance from Toni Collette. I personally loved it. I'll be seeing this again to delve deeper.

 Well I just had my worst theater experience. I really wanted to watch this movie since I saw that wonderful trailer for the first time, so I decided to go see it as soon as I could. It turns out that the theater was packed an everyone was just either talking or laughing throughout the whole movie. This was especially annoying because I really wanted to get invested but it was nearly impossible with everyone just taking me out of the experience. I'll definetly watch this again when it comes out on Blu-ray, but it was a shame that my first watch was ruined by other people. 

Nevertheless it was extremely well directed, the story was coherent within its rules and it had some disturbing imagery that I won't forget in a long time. My favorite part was when Peter was sitting in the car right after the accident happened. It was so tense and real, I felt like I had just killed my sister. Did anyone else notice that the teacher's first lecture, about the greek tragedy and whether or not it was more tragic for the hero to see the signs or not to see the signs of impending doom, was a foreshadowing for Peter? Demons love to turn things upside down to mock them.

When the mother found Charlie's body, she was inconsolable and in the fetal position slamming her head into the floor in despair.

Later when she's possessed, she's in the same fetal position but this time she's slamming her head on the ceiling and trying to get at her other child. Ok so if Paimon on was put into Charlie’s body at a very young age, the real ghost of Charlie was who they summoned during the scene at the dining table. 

It’s why Charlie seemed more alive in Annie’s body than she ever did before the car scene. She was a scared little girl. The Charlie we saw before that car scene was a misplaced demon.  [deleted] Poor Steve.... Homey just wanted to be a good dad. The recurring theme of failing to deal with trauma head-on and have it manifest in horrifying ways was something I noticed:

- Annie pushed her clearly mentally ill mother away when she gave birth to Peter, only to have her come back with a newfound resolve to take control of Charlie when she was born.

- Annie doesn't react after Ellen dies, she even asks Steve if she should be feeling sadder, only for this to be the beginning of a rapid downward spiral of the whole family

- Steve is alerted that Ellen's grave was desecrated, but tries ignoring it only for the body to show up in their own attic as part of the black magic ritual

- Peter fails to even acknowledge the fact that Charlie was killed.  He doesn't call 9-1-1, he doesn't even tell his parents until they discover the decapitated body the next morning.  He tries ignoring the event, but soon starts to breakdown, eventually becoming the host for the demon

- Annie tries getting help at the therapy group, but when she second guesses it, she falls into the hands of Joan and ultimately dooms both her husband and son Something my brother pointed out: after Charlie dies and Annie is on the bedroom floor freaking out, she's in the same ""Hail Pie Man"" pose as they are in the end of the film.

Maybe just a coincidence, as it's a pretty generic pose, but still.

Also, can anyone confirm whether or not Peter's fingers when he was in class were contorted in the same way the fingers on the statue were? Just got back, the freakiest moment for me was:

[the smiling naked man in the closet, which *I'm pretty sure is the same smiling man during the funeral at the beginning of the movie*](#spoiler) weird episode of united states of tara  I do not care what other great performances I see for the rest of the year. Toni Collette should be at the top of everyone’s Best Actress list for the Oscar. That’s an all-timer right there!! And it had the added bonus of being a great nod to ""The Exorcist"" My friend and I were discussing that afterwards, like at what point do you just fucking off yourself in that situation... Shocked he didn’t do it earlier tbh

I would have leapt right out that window ASAP Why did you try to kill me mommy?!?! Wahhhhhahhhh

kid fucking nailed the horrified child in a growing teen's body. [deleted] Yeah this scene stands out in my mind as being really effective and frightening. A standout scene. What makes it so disturbing is the fact that we're led to believe Annie did it *again*. Well aware that she had done it once before and that it was really fucked up. With all the crazy stuff that happens in this movie, both times I saw it the part where she tells him she didn’t want him got the biggest gasps out of the audience. The pace of that scene is incredible. This was my favorite scene ""Hey, Annie? It's Lance, from the gallery? So two quick things; first, we're all super excited about Peter becoming one of the eight demons of Hell. He's such a great kid and all of us here think the world of him, and we will totally be binding our souls to his will. Karen reserved a conference room for the worship rites. You must be so excited! Really, congrats. Second, just wanted to touch base about the gallery opening..."" [deleted] They called to say they would offer an extension.  The way they keep you firmly in Peter's perspective through that whole scene is almost even worse than showing it. When they cut to the next day and you just \*hear\* Annie downstairs, saying she'd about to leave.  My heart was just sinking, my God.  This movie was so good at building dread. Yeah, seems like the original dialogue was a continuity error (Annie performed a seance alone before waking up her family), so they changed it. I noticed it too. Also, It was unnecessary ADR because the family ended up all in the same room anyway during the seance.

*Hijacking my own comment to ask a question. There was a shot of something in Annie's cup at Joan's house. Did anyone notice what it was? Alex was insanely great. Conveying a story without any dialogue is so hard. He did an amazing job. I actually thought Annie was the one getting owned at the kitchen table lmao. The kid is traumatized and Annie is just projecting her own shit at the poor kid.  I love Gabriel Byrne. When I was working in the service industry, I brought him his brunch and he tipped me $35 for a $15 plate. Good Guy Gabriel Byrne.  yeah Alex Wolff stood out to me big time  They somehow managed to make a little girl eating cake more horrifying than all of the Insidious sequels...  What was the deal with her and fuckin chocolate? Lol. Yes! That poor kid. The actor did an awesome job of subtly hinting that he is deeply fucking traumatized. Not showing the body in the back seat was worse than actually showing it ever could have been.  Quick PSA if you're driving, from someone who lives in the land of a million deer: DO NOT FUCKING VEER FROM THE DEER!!!! If you see a deer in the road, living or dead, you brake, you go straight. You. Do. Not. Veer.  The deer will do some damage to your car, but not much. If you veer away from it there's a strong possibility you die or you decapitate your sister and summon the 8th lord of hell to possess your body. Don't veer from the deer.  Never smoke pot right before you have to drive your little sister to the hospital  Being stoned during that scene honestly made me wanna die “What’s more tragic, having control over your own fate or not?” Poor Peter’s fate was always to kill Charlie. Whether it was the pot or something else, this all ended the same way.  She was a mix of Shelly Duvall and Jack Nicolson at the same time. Amazing performance.  He didn't want them to catch Paimonia Why was he set on fire, and not annie?  cold never bothered me anyway I felt so bad for him throughout the whole movie. Guy did nothing wrong other than marry a crazy woman and then had to watch his whole family die before he burned alive. Poor guy Someone elsewhere in the thread said there was an alternate test ending where he gouged his eyes out post possession  Apparently in test screenings he rips his own eyes out at the end and that’s how the movie ended. For the final cut they pulled that and added the little speech after he got crowned. 

But yeah, all that imagery of the X’d Out eyes? I was expecting it.  I was convinced he would. They were reading Antigone and Oedipus Rex in his English class,  I thought for sure that was some foreshadowing to him taking his own eyes. Those classroom scenes were great. During one of them one of the girls was like ""you mean the audience was ignoring blatant signs during the play"" or something to that effect, and I knew that i was about to hear some foreshadowing. Also, in the Spiritualism book, it briefly shows that the summoning of Paimon must utilize a lustful male.  What a fucking movie. 
Not a shot or word of dialog was wasted. Pure dread the entire time! One other thing in regards to the idea of Charlie being possessed: Charlie does that tongue clicking noise all the time.  Once Peter is possessed by Paimon, he immediately does the same tongue click. I know I'm a week late here but I have another point to ""Charlie was always Paimon."" Annie says, at the start when she's comforting Charlie, that Charlie never cried as a baby. Not even when she was born. [removed] Paimon needs a HEALTHY male body. The grandfather starving himself renders his body too weak and unhealthy for Paimon to inhabit. The way Peter’s arm contorted in the class room was the same way the idol in the treehouse’s arm was contorted. Yeah the criticism that the cultists couldn’t have predicted the accident makes no sense at all. They practice magic. They didn’t need to predict it, they caused it to happen. The whole logic of the film is that all the tragedy suffered by this family was orchestrated by the cult to achieve their sinister goals. There was no point where they weren’t in control. This is made extra clear by the classroom discussion where the teacher asks whether the tragedy of the protagonist in the story they are discussing would have been more or less tragic if he had been able to change events/had free will.  Peter with his broken nose even looked birdlike in the end of the movie!  Once bitch crawled on the wall our whole theater exhaled “fuckkkkk”

From there is sped up like crazy... I was honestly sitting there wishing someone would pause the movie at the theater because I just needed a break. That slow burn was long and intense! The whole I felt so uncomfortable and the last 30 oh gosh. I want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride Yeah... that's Charlie. The interesting thing is that all of Charlie's drawings that I recall were foreshadowing, so if she drew that girl it was probably part of her foretelling the events that led to her own death. The guy next to me noped out of the theater after that scene This movie did amazing in the uncomfortable department 

It did not pull away from upsetting content, it didn’t show you a flash of a rotting corpse, it made you FOCUS on this child’s head

Very upsetting  I’ve never seen anything like that. That scene, coupled with NOT seeing Charlie in the backseat/Peter refusing to look back while in shock after it happened combined to make the most disturbing thing I’ve seen in a film. 

Just... holy shit.  That (and the following funeral) is when the movie reminded me of Pet Sematary. The film of that is not very good but it has some truly stark, disturbing moments, imagery and ideas which stick in your brain. I came home from this movie just a little bit ago and turned on The Office just so I wouldn’t be scared.

Thank you for this.  ...I'm pretty sure none of that's real. He was huge. The car accident scene he carried the emotional weight it needed, the dinner fight he was great, and the school face smashing scene where he seemed genuinely scared of himself. Nuts. The bedroom scene between Toni and Alex when she tells him how she never wanted him was an emotional roller coaster. When they’re drenched in paint thinner and crying at one another it was heart breaking and terrifying.  If back in 2008 you told me the younger brother from Naked Brothers Band would go on to be one of the most underrated young actors of the second half of the 2010s, I'd think you're crazy. He's been killing it recently.  Two Volvos, and a million dollar custom home on a mountain and endless Hershey bars. They had enough, they are expensive, but those bastards just didn't like Charlie. In the end, the real horror was capitalism. Seriously- just have 1 epipen in the right place and this whole movie would not have happened. I bet where ever that damn Eli pen is it has Paimon’s creepy symbol on it. What other movies would you recommend in that vein? With ""fuck me, I can't even comprehend how I would feel in that situation"" scenes like Charlie's death?

That got to me *deep*, man. Way more than any ahhh it's a spooky demon monster scene in any other horror movies. Like yeah they give you things to be spooked about when you're walking to the kitchen late at night after the movie, but they don't tear out your fucking heart.

I have a little sister. I think I'd kill myself if I was in Peter's position. I just can't imagine waking up, going to school, etc. knowing that I'm the reason my little sister is dead. 

Honestly he's a bit of a cockhead for bringing her to the party. When his mom called his bluff he should have either told her the truth or made some excuse not to go. I felt like I was the only one that didn't feel very great about the 13 year old girl (that looks younger tbh) at the party with some song about pussy-popping in the background. The parties I was at in high school? It would have been weird af if someone brought their super young little sibling. Annie finding Charlie the day after was one of the worst emotional gut-punches I've experienced. My friends and I went out for fro-yo after the movie ended because we needed something happy. That part hit me hard. Peter’s reaction afterwards was so genuine and believable. I was in shock.  It really hurt my heart when that was happening and Peter just kept crying and saying “mommy, mommy please stop, mommy” Holy shit yes. In my head I was imagining her banging her fists on the door, when it cut out to her just on the ceiling it was so unnerving and unexpected.  hurts the impact when it’s in the trailer  She certainly got a headache from it, but dont worry, the headache didnt last long.  Another small detail, what was with the father's weird phone conversation after the grandmother's funeral? Where he found out grandma was exhumed. He said something like, ""it's not even been a week yet."" When the mom asked what it was about he got all weird and lied about it. What was that about?? I had a moron yelling stupid shit the whole time. Legit the first shot 'That's my tree house! HAHAHA!' 'Oh my God they killed Kenny!' 'Look at his weiner!' 'That was stupid!' Non stop 😒 this was his first movie? holy shit Oh my god you are so right!! Pandaemonium is the Capital of Hell, from Paradise Lost. Ocean’s 666 I SAW THAT TOO i thought it was supposed to be charlie outside I thought Charlie was watching him through the treehouse because the next scene she makes a bong out of a pill bottle and her little crafts. But that being said I was noticing the cult throughout the movie and it made me very uneasy.  There's another shot of the house where it cuts instantly from day to night and in the night shot you see people (presumably the cult members) standing around the property. One part I didn’t get was why the husband caught fire when the book was burned yet annie burned during her first attempt 

Edit: also did anyone notice how Peter physically looked like he wasn’t part of the family 

Edit 2: does anyone know how the grandmother originally died? I have a suspicion that the friend (who later played the shit out of annie) was trying to sabotage the grandmother so that she could be the conjurer and receive all the riches. I remember her also telling Annie that her son and grandson both drowned indicating that she tried to summon Paimon through them as well  I feel like the cult orchestrating the killing of Charlie would make sense, but seems like a huge stretch considering the circumstances. How would they have made it so that she stuck her head out of the window at the exact right moment? How could they have made sure she ate the cake? I think the director/writer may have *wanted* it to seem like they were behind it but it felt like I had to suspend my belief a lot to make that work. This is more or less the explanation I've landed on, with one major addendum -- I think Paimon temporarily possesses Peter (when Ann Dowd 'casts him out,' he sees the lights, then he contorts himself) but the possession breaks when he bashes his head against the desk. I think they decide they need to weaken him more, and Paimon goes from the notebook to Annie in order to scare Peter into jumping out the window, leaving him much more vulnerable and susceptible. Some extra things as well. 

•Grandmas husband starved himself probably so that his body wouldn’t be used. 

•Could it be that Annie subconsciously knew what was going on? That’s why she in the past tried to kill Peter with the lighter fluid so that Paimon wouldn’t take him. 

 I never got the feeling that he was worried about her fidelity. I think he was just concerned about her mental state and how she was dealing with the loss of both her mother and daughter so soon after. He didn't believe that she was truly coping with it all. I agree, and in the scope of the movie he plays the pretty typical disbelieving dad role, but the story is so well balanced that it's entirely valid for him to chalk up what HE sees as just the effects of mental illness. Which doesn't detract from the horror at all, if you put yourself in his shoes, scenes like the seance and Annie trying to convince him to burn the book are both heartbreaking and disturbing. This movie can function just as effectively as a drama/psychological thriller as horror.  I think he was a very good person but pretty flawed as well. He was an enabler of sorts (maybe the wrong word?). Standing at the sidelines while his family unraveled. He let a lot of moments of disfunction just kind of linger. I guess maybe having a father-in-law like this may have me projecting. lol The whole aftermath of Charlie's death damn near gave me a panic attack. My chest was so tight Honestly this was the most harrowing scene in the movie for me - the other scenes were scary yeah but nothing really amounts to the grief and sorrow of the scene where Charlie is found Ooo, or maybe a wolf in sheep's clothing! I thought it was kind of a metaphor for the cult's manipulation of the family. The characters in the movie were like dolls being played with for their sinister purposes. I noticed a lot of the establishment shots are tilt\-shifted to make the buildings look like miniatures as well, enhancing that idea. That’s my question. Taking it literally, does grandma just have a possession obsession? Or is Annie schizophrenic, and it’s intensifying because of her family’s tragedy? Or do the creators want us to think that, hence the title, as a red herring from what is actually going on, which is that grandma is legit in tight with hell demons? 

Was it real???

Doesn’t matter, I enjoyed it either way. Toni Colette knocked it out of the park.  I agree with everything you said. The subtlety in this film is a\-m\-azing!  
\-The weird smiles at the funeral.  
\-The emblem on the street pole.  
I obviously need to watch it a 2nd time but there's so many shots that linger for like 1 second and you have to be paying attention to catch what is in it, but when you do it is just so creepily immersive. 

Loved it.  Part of a test audience two times here: you get Paimon ripping out his eyes at the end or no? Between THE WITCH and this, I am incredibly here for the A24 witch cinematic universe. Another great piece was the part where Joan said every member of the family had to be in the house

Everyone was. Dead or alive  Speaking of cinematography, how incredible were the shadey shots of figures in the corners of the room, as well as the smiley man in the closet at the end. My favourite shot was the father burning besides Annie with the wide angle. ALL THE NAKED SMILING PEOPLE FUCKED ME UP SO BAD!

I love this movie but dude that guy in the closet is gonna give me nightmares... Anyone know why !decapitation! was the big thing in this movie? 

Is it something to do with Lore that I’m missing?  Barely being able to see Toni Collette in the upper corner made me shit my pants. And then her swimming through the air out of the room. I flipped the fuck out in the theater. Yup. Everyone from the mom's side of the family was kneeling in front of the Charlie/Paimon statue.  ""I never wanted to be your mother"" is what got me.  I hope she Toni Collects some kind of award for her performance.  THAT FACE ON YOUR FACE! Yeah, I can't remember the last time I was so *bothered* (for lack of a better term) by a movie. Just.... unease and dread and *terror*.

I also kind of liked that some of the parts that rattled me weren't even ""scary"" parts. Annie wailing after what happens to Charlie and the dinner table argument come to mind. Not ""scary"" in a horror movie sense like a lot of the other scenes that got to me, but just as disturbing. I'm pretty sure that was the director's voice.  Ari Aster. The demon can only enter a male host in a weakened state (for whatever reason). Probably grandma kept starving him to make him weak enough to be used as a host, but he died first.  Going off of that second point, she also mentions that her mom had DID, which iirc from high school psychology is multiple personality disorder. This would explain why the grandma had this Paimon inside of her, and why she needed to pass it down to her son. Annie also mentions that when she had Peter she wouldn't let her mother near him, which is why grandma had to settle for passing Paimon down to Charlie, who grandma always wishes had been a boy. 

I can't wait to watch again to pick up a lot of the other things I might've missed that play into the story!  Ok but who the hell needs that many walnuts for a cake, and who chops them like that? Great detail, but it definitely felt like Chekov’s walnut.  Some in my theater yelled ""Oh shit! Look in the corner!"" It was like some creepy magic eye trick. They pulled lighting off perfectly.  The rippling effect of more and more people in the audience seeing her in the corner of the screen was amazing. I won't soon forget how it felt to hear people start to gasp and mutter and curse, wonder what they were seeing, see it myself, join in the gasping and muttering and cursing, and then hear the rest of the audience follow suit. So fun. The rapid ""crawling"" away right after that got me (and other audience members) pretty good. Completely unexpected. Wasn't there a thread on /r/movies about creepiest shots in a movie? I'd put that one in there. During the dream sequence where they’re covered in lighter fluid and the flames start, Peter screams “why did you want to kill me?” And she screams back “to protect you”  a good amount of people in theatre started laughing when she floated and when the creepy naked people were in the house it was so annoying, i feel like some people do that as a sort of defense mechanism to stop themselves from getting too scared idk. absolutely loved the movie tho, can’t get the last 30 minutes out of my head  Wait. What. [deleted] Annie's brother, her father, her uncle, and Joan's son amd grandson all met untimely ends.  I think the cult has been trying for a while. You're right. The cult probably wanted Peter first (maybe they even conceived the birth, hence why he looks different from his family) but then Annie cut off all contact with her mom as per her husband's wishes. There was definitely use of tilt shift to play off the dolls house / real world manipulation theme [deleted] [deleted] I legitimately felt unclean after leaving the theater.  People kept laughing in my theatre. After Charlie was beheaded and when the mom was manic and trying to get her son and husband to do the seance.

I didn't find a single part of this movie funny. Our theater experience was terrible too. Guy next to us fell asleep and was snoring, loudly. Someone brought their child, probably no more than 2 years old,  who was constantly making noise and even cried a couple times. And two people got into a loud argument in the middle of the movie because one of them wouldn’t stop fiddling with their phone and the light was distracting. Probably the worst movie going experience ever. Missed parts of the movie because of the all the ruckus.  I can’t express how fucking glad I am that they didn’t focus on the girl Peter liked  that was cool when he was in class and looked up at the rear view mirror Inappropriate as fuck
Equally hilarious 
10/10 Never seen someone ever put up a performance full of such malice as she did.  I was honestly horrified by that scene alone just as much as most of the horror in the film, save the car scene and what followed it, the desk, and the ending. It seemed clear to me that was what happened. You hear Toni Collette's character talking about how she was going into town, then silence, then the screams. Makes it so much worse and disturbing to me knowing she found her daughter's headless body.

From the scene of walnuts being chopped up to the scene of the mother screaming on the floor, that whole part of the movie was maybe the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in a movie, both emotionally and visually. Shit, it's gonna stick with me. Yeah. Everyone at Grandma's funeral were the cult members. They all came back to nakedly hail their new king. Were people [clicking](#spoiler) at your showing? Lol two grown ass men walked out before it started. One even announced “I’m Leaving,” it was weird.  I watched a women bring her two kids, both under 8 probably. They stayed through the whole thing. if one of my kids died, this movie would trigger the shit out of me Dude what the fuck I wanted to throw up that entire scene. I was high as shit too I really felt awful for peter  dude, same.
edit: My eyes kept wandering to the corner of my room looking for Toni chilling in the upper corner :( One reaction people can have to fear is laughter. Pie man lol The great thing about the Exorcist is that the staircase is really that long  That’s probably what happened to Annie’s dad and brother, they both died unusually young.  Maybe they killed themselves before they could be possessed? Right!? Some people laughed at the way he cried but it was so very real to a teenager being terrified and feeling so lost/reaching out for the parents because they are still a child. People say he was whiny but he played a teenager perfectly. You may be smarter, edgier and try to do adult stuff, but you're still just a kid in a bigger body. His breakdowns were painful to watch in the most complementary way to the actor. He didn't hold anything back and really showed some vulnerability.  She was ""trying to save"" him. From Paimon.  >the part where she tells him she didn’t want him got the biggest gasps out of the audience.

That scene was gut-wrenching.  I was so relieved when it turned out to be a dream.  But when Peter says he had a nightmare too right afterwards, you can't help but wonder if he was dreaming the same thing. Really want to watch a satanic generic midwest office movie now.  I don't think anyone is going to call them back This movie filled me with a sense of dread few movies have ever done. It was incredible  Yeah I noticed that as well. Just thought it was kind of funny because of how glaringly noticeable it was I think they redid the line to foreshadow that the grandmother’s body was in the attic? And Charlie was her favorite? 

There definitely was something in there. Not 100% sure what.  That was honestly an incredibly layered performance from a 13 year old. Especially her reactions to being told about the party or the dad telling her she could get pneumonia and she just says “That’s okay”, but in this sense that she’s just heard people say that phrase in similar contexts so she’s just trying to mentally plug in something that might work because she doesn’t understand. I know a lot of that is from the script but her mannerisms and facial expressions REALLY enhanced the character a lot. I sorta thought the Grandma almost conditioned Charlie to go for sweets. I mean, it’s what takes her out in the end and that itself was planned by the cult (considering the Paimon symbol on the pole that decapitated her) I can't imagine what I'd do in that situation. I was totally prepared for him to try and off himself cause honestly I would. What a burden to live with. Exactly. We experienced it like he did. Sight unseen. He didn’t even go to the hospital to take care of the body and to call his parents from there. Just straight home and to bed. The amount of guilt and shock was so heavy. Did Joan kill the deer and place it there on purpose?  How about keep some fucking extra Epi-Pens around?? Someone in my theater had a panic attack and couldn’t breath during the movie. They were surprised/shocked at a scene. Was sure if it was this one.  The whole family was bound to the book. So they could choose who to burn at what time.  My friends and I assumed her burning the book was her sleep walking (the Dad was also asleep right there on the couch and never woke up while she struggled on Fire) so the “spirits” got her to believe that she would burn up if the book was burned but really it would be the husband.  when he says ""hey you really oughta sign up for those SAT classes because it's coming up"" just broke my heart. Dude just wanted a normal life and be a good dad to his kids :( Something tells me Joan's off screen voiceover to neatly wrap everything up was due to test audiences too. WTF, they should have kept it in! I think they needed to add that VO. I was a bit lost without it.

I can take or leave the eye loss. I was very happy with it as is. Alex Wolff was fascinating to watch in the shift. “Literally ignoring the signs that were literally handed to them” But then Joan calls Peter ""Charlie"" in the tree house at the end. Did Charlie's spirit go into her brother along with Paimon? Did Charlie just never have her own soul, like she and Paimon were one and the same? Hm. That scene made me so uncomfortable. Fuck. Also, she eats chocolate like a crazy person. Definitely not human. I have a sneaking suspicion this was connected to the tea that Annie drinks at Joanies house where she has to put her hand to her lips to remove a flake. 

My gut tells me that it's something the cult was trying to feed her, and that they couldn't get her to do it at the funeral where she would kiss her mother goodbye, so she had to ingest it in the tea Joanie fed her. I just assumed it was a mortician touching up her makeup, but that was when I thought I was going into a normal movie. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I was wondering the significance of starvation. Someone in the row behind me lost it at that part and started crying. The guy next to her was trying to console her. It really added to the experience.  One woman in the audience noticed her a bit later than most of us did and muttered “ohmygod” when she finally caught on. The whole audience cracked up at how slow she was on the uptake 😆 From Peter waking up to Peter out the window i didn't watch much. I started sweating intensely and think I had a mild panic attack.  I almost did too. I felt sick to my stomach. That's why I look at reviews beforehand so I can see all the people saying ""This is the most disturbing shit I've ever seen, I hope you're not a fan of sleeping"" and I know what to expect. Not just focus on the child's head, but focus on it while we hear her mother wailing.  The complete silence in contrast to her frantically gasping for breath moments before is what got me. You could just *feel* the presence of her death. I think the Naked Brothers Band prepared him for this I loved thinking, ""Wait, he's crying, but why is he that wet? Oh she's wet now too! Oh shit!!!"" People in my theater were laughing at this scene and many other scenes that weren’t funny. I do not recommend to others seeing this in a packed theater. I was not a happy camper  Charlie and the chocolate factory Decapitalism, actually. I think mother! had a similar vibe. Just a constantly escalating suffocating atmosphere and a feeling of powerlessness and confusion. Antichrist is in a similar vein, as is The Killing of A Sacred Deer. Highly recommend both.  We Need to talk about Kevin! The VVitch! When she was screaming “I JUST WANNA DIE” and convulsing on the ground I literally felt so unwell. That whole thing was honestly the most horrifying part of the movie. I was not okay afterward. It was just so real the way everyone behaved. I almost had to leave the theater it made me so upset. But I really really appreciate that a movie can make me feel that way. The kids and Toni were acting their hearts out.  My immediate bought was, “bravo marketing department.” Did not see that coming.  I agree I have a little sister and if that happened to her I'd probobly behaved the same way.  Yeah and when he started crying during the seance it really hit me super hard. I cried like that as a teen when my uncle died and it was just so real. And him saying ""mommy"" instead of mom really made it seem genuine. Like all of a sudden he was a kid and he felt helpless To add on, I assumed she had been banging her fists on the door, but then I realized.... The door was on the ceiling, twice her height.  As soon as I wondered how she could be banging on that door when it was that high up, it cut to her hitting her head.  I've never had my jaw drop during a movie before, until now.  That image is seared into my head. I was so happy I didn't see the trailer for this one.  A) “It’s not even been a week” = “Whoa what the fuck, who does that and what are the chances I would happen so soon”

B) Lying about it = ...not telling your *still grieving *wife that her *very recently deceased* mother’s corpse  has been *desecrated* because telling her then would accomplish nothing but make her feel worse The grave had been desecrated is what he said. which is why the body was up in the attic someone had destroyed the grave and put her up there Good god... I think this is when beating someone to a pulp is legal. I felt myself getting angry just reading this. Fucccck that person. Yes, pretty incredible. Will definitely be looking out for more films from him in the future.   Also is Joan actually in the first scene with the lost loved ones meeting? She just approaches her car in the parking lot kinda out of nowhere Me too but  looking back it makes sense that it was one of the cult members. 

The more I look back at this movie the more I love it.  Paimon had “possessed” the notebook, and as far as I can tell coerced Annie into believing that destroying the book would save her family, but instead Paimon killed Steve and possessed Annie, where he stayed until taking over Peter’s body. 

The thing about Paimon having possessed the book might not be accurate, I believe that there is a shot of the light entering or exiting the book, but I can’t recall for sure. Either way Paimon was manipulating the entire situation to possess Annie and eventually take his final host in Peter.  I think that Paimon can only exit through the head, hence why the grandmas body was headless in the attic, Charlie was decapitated in the car, and Annie cut her head off with the piano string, and also why the husbands charred corpse was headless, meaning that he had Paimon inside of him, which means Paimon burned him along with the book.  I think the husband burning was because he didn't believe and he was the only thing standing between Paimon and the family at that point, and he's the only one in the film who isn't related to the grandmother.

 That said, I'm not sure why Annie burned, but maybe it was self-preservation of Paimon to get Annie to stop, though burning the book ended up not preventing further events. I’ll have to see it again but I’m fairly certain it’s implied that Paimon is the one influencing the outcome of events. Even if the cult is part of it though, I think it’s more black magic than complicated orchestration.  Yeah, did anyone catch the scene where he has his e-mail open and is messaging a psychiatrist regarding Annie's mental health and well-being? 

I don't think it's the first time she's had a mental break. Demons? Ghosts? Seances? Pfft, never gonna happen. Finding your kid's decapitated body in the back of the car because your son was in shock and just went to bed? Possible enough to be fucking terrifying > I thought it was kind of a metaphor for the cult's manipulation of the family. The characters in the movie were like dolls being played with for their sinister purposes

Didn't think of this! I think you might be right. She says, ""I don't know many of you"" at her mother's funeral. Lots of payoff with this one. Also when the husband asks “what’s that smell”

Might wanna check the attic buddy  Holy shit! You reminding me of the smile just made it click!!!

The dude that smiled at Charlie was the first naked dude Peter sees after he sees his dad burned. Also Charlie being very tomboy-ish (even taking on a masculine nickname) and saying how grandma wanted her to be a boy. Plus Annie's brother killed himself from schizophrenia and accused their mom of ""putting people in him"". Little stuff like that really adds up by the end.  no! I thought this would happen because the picture of him had the eyes poked out! He just stood there looking regal haha W-what? No, the ending I saw was just the shot of the interior view of the room with the kinda ghosty glow in the background with them saying hail paimon. Can you describe what you saw? FUCK that would’ve been the perfect ending. He stands there and gets crowned with a slightly awkward speech (that little speech was the only thing in the whole movie I didn’t like). With all the pictures with the eyes crossed out that would’ve been a great pay off.  How graphic was the car accident scene in test screenings? Having read the script after just seeing the film, it seemed a bit tamer on screen. The decapitation seemed a little more detailed, and I don't remember it happening that way. Then again, that scene is kind of a blur to me now because it was so shocking.

I remembered him from the funeral at the beginning, he was in the back of one shot giving Peter pedo eyes. If you look closely at the photo (of the devil king) in the spell book Annie opens, he’s riding a horse with three heads on his belt strap The literal answer is likely its involvement in Paimon’s ritual, but I think there’s an argument to be made for a more symbolic interpretation of those in the family losing their mind/head and succumbing to their mental illnesses.  I imagine it was part of the sacrifice. Three women, all headless? Too specific to not be a coincidence.  Yeah I caught that. I was just making sure, tbh. Guy I went with missed that it was Charlie and doesn’t believe me.  That scene got audible gasps in my theater... The face on your face line and her claiming that he's always sneering at her tires in with the reflection of his own sneering face that Peter saw in the glass at school. Then that make sense why the cult decided to kill Charlie in a way that would do the most damage to Peter.  Whoa, do you think that's why Annie couldn't miscarry Peter? That the death cult was somehow protecting him because they needed her to have a boy? My boyfriend pointed out - at what high school drinking parties are kids baking cakes? Made me chuckle when I thought about it.

 Someone yellled, ""Oh shit! This nigga's eating beans!""

Most embarrassing movie going experience of my life.

 In one of the wide shots of the house going from night to day you can see several naked cult members standing around the house.  It's only there for a beat, then it cuts to the day shot.  Pretty great. it was dead...fucking...quiet.  a rat could have fucking farted and everyone would have jumped. Behaviour like this should not be tolerated. I wish theatres had better rules to combat it.  What was the point of her? Just to humanize Peter?  Yes it was obnoxious Yuuuuuuup. I was more annoyed by the people next to me talking the ENTIRE time, but the clicking sucked. Especially when people were doing it during scenes where the characters were hearing it. Couldn't distinguish between the audience and the movie a couple times. Brb gotta summon Paimon I feel like if you’ve lost a child or a loved one recently then this movie is not something that you really want to see. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone if I knew they’d gone through something like this.  I hope the children aren't traumatized Had a really fucking annoying family bring two small kids (like the oldest had to be no older than 12) to the showing last night. The dad was a complete asshole making comments the whole movie about how they ""went from seeing Jumanji to this dumbass movie"" lmao. Then afterwards, my friend and I walk out to see the boy, who had to be like 8-10 years old, asking ""So the mom killed herself, right?..."" which was answered with ""Stop talking about it!"" from his sister and mom. We just stood there like, well shit, if you don't want your kids asking about self-decapitations, then maybe don't take them to a movie full of decapitations! I swear some people are legitimately brain dead. She did mention that her brother was convinced they were trying to ""put people inside of him"". I assume that both were at one point considered to be the male host for Paimon and killed themselves instead.

Annie's  brother must have found out that he was supposed to be the male host, since he told Annie their mother was ""trying to put people inside him,"" suggesting that perhaps he wasn't schizophrenic, just the only person aware of his mother's sinister plans. Note that he hung himself in the mom's room, which is an interesting metaphor. Unlike the women in the family, who all literally and metaphorically lose their heads (as a metaphor for insanity), he is able to keep his head even after death, symbolizing his awareness of the scheme and his relative sanity by avoiding it (relative to Annie, Ellen, and Charlie). 

The husband (Annie's dad) starved himself to death, rendering his body unhealthy and undesirable for Paimon, who desires a healthy male body.  “What We Do in the Shadows”. Like The Office with vampires.

https://youtu.be/cWKL1gFCS54 I honestly thought they were trying to portray her as on the spectrum or having some kind of developmental problems. But turns out nope, just Paimon. Good performance by the actress.  Her face all twisted up with genuine concern after the grandmother's funeral as Annie is trying to comfort her brought legit tears to my eyes. I had the same feeling when Peter was telling her to go ask for cake while he went upstairs. The notion of a child being embarrassed or afraid in those situations is really heartbreaking, and the actress fucking nailed the eyes-down, trying-to-disappear look.  Legit I think I would have just droven off a cliff if that shit happened. I thought the same thing! I immediately imagined myself in his situation... I have younger brother who is 14 and I couldn’t even imagine having to live with the guilt. Especially after that scene at the dinner table where his mom straight up tells him she blames him for Charlie’s death and she can’t forgive him.  My first thought after watching him drive home and just lay there was that he was going to light himself on fire and that it was him in the commercial.  The film kind of has this “is this real?” feel to it which I think is supposed to be reflective of how you might feel when grieving. That's something I've been wondering. I've learned more towards it all being real and not madness of Peter and Annie, but the deer+telephone pole is such a bizarre way to kill someone, like how could they have known this would work? I still can't explain that while scene The symbol was on the post, suggesting it was premeditated, but pretty ridiculous that they could manufacture that exact scenario.  First there has to be a party, then the son has to want to go, then the mom has to make him take his sister, THEN SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO, but knows the mom is going to force it... Yea what kind of mom sends her highly allergic kid who apparently doesn't know what nuts are (as seen at the beginning with both parents making sure the candy bar doesn't have nuts) to a party with no epi pen.  I left the theater after this scene. I deal with depression and anxiety and it was a bit heavy to watch the grieving. I came back in though after a minute or so.  I'm sorry, I'm dumb. Can you clarify? I know Peter was shown with crossed out eyes in it, when did other family members appear in the book? I actually interpreted that as having actually happened - they made a point of showing the dad take an extra sleeping pill before laying down on the couch which is why he didn’t wake up. Movie used a lot of way too real stuff... the dad trying to support the family and just burying emotions...until towards the end where he just breaks down in the car. His exhaustion at the end was so palpable... I felt just as exhausted as him lol. Yeah I agree, it was a little...out of place? But it made sense 

I’d like to see the alternate ending but I was fine with this one. Makes sense that shell shocked King of Hell would not go right for ripping his eyes out  Nah bro don’t lay that on me Really? I thought the passage about Paimon in the book made it pretty clear what was going on. The only thing the VO really cleared up for me was that Charlie was Paimon, but I think I could have caught on to that with another watch or two. >Did Charlie's spirit go into her brother along with Paimon? 

Probably. Paimon possessed her body for years, so probably did take her soul with him. That's how I interpret the photo of Paimon in the book having [heads strung to the horse](https://i.imgur.com/BrE1WhY.png). Charlie was also killed ritually. 

I think this means that he kept Annie and Ellen (Grammy)'s souls as well. Which might be why the photo of Ellen at the end was titled ""Queen"". She was essentially married to Paimon, and not just the leader of the cult The fucktards in my theater were laughing. Like wtf was funny about that scene, I was at the edge of my seat barely breathing that whole sequence I don't blame her. It was an extremely disturbing film.  Toni Collette's screaming when she discovers the body was probably the most chilling part of the movie for me. 

She was unreal in this movie. I LOVED that touch. Before we see the actual result of the accident we get Peter reacting to what happened, coming home, going to bed, hearing his mom find the body, and THEN we see the head. The restraint of this film was unbelievable.  It may have been deeply unsettling but i applaud this film for how masterfully it conveyed the situation.  No. Way. The wailing, my god the wailing was so believable. Ugh god I felt disgusting inside. bent down on all fours in a very praising position Probably one of the best imitations of absolute grief and despair that I have ever seen. It made me feel unclean. My heart was pounding because I just knew it was coming and still it was so much worse than I could imagine. I had to plug my ears. And then that shot of her head ?? I was like oh my god it's worse than what I had even imagined.  
  
""Worse than I could even imagine""- one more for good measure lol Yeah this (among a lot of the movie) was incredibly visceral and painful to watch. It was just too real. Like horror should be, I suppose. 

Reminded me a lot of The Witch and The Babadook. Slow-burning, psychological horror. Way more effective than stupid jump scares.  Yeah I just assumed she’d be a major part of the whole movie Yeah that was great writing/acting there!  Which was imo that reaction was quite deliberate seeing how the movie points out on multiple occassions that it was out of reach (ie using the long stick just to reach it). Point being, the filmmakers were clever. On the other hand, the trailer makes you think this movie is a full length Charlie movie, so you get *swerved* pretty fucking hard by the accident.  Joan was there in the first grief group scene. I saw this too. It was definitely one of the cult members. They were watching over Peter the entire film.

The blonde guy standing in the hallway smiling at the end, we see him I think at Peters school staring & smiling at peter. The movie said something along the way about Paimon needing a ""vulnerable"" host, and I understood the husband bursting into flames as the moment Annie breaks and Paimon takes control completely.  Then when Annie (now Paimon) is sawing her head off in front of Peter, that's what breaks him and allows him to take control.

Still confused how he is actually able to do what he does though.  I think Paimon had a lot more power than we were ever led to believe. The movie pretended to establish rules just to subvert them, but not in such a way that it felt unfair.  And...the scene where Annie was hanging there sawing off her head was actually Paimon releasing his spirit from her body so he could get into Peter...I didn't get that before. Yeah seeing the symbol inscribed on the powerline in the earlier scene makes me think there was a 'curse' or source of influence that marked that spot as the place where the accident would happen. “Strange, new faces.” Strange, indeed.  There are SO many instances of dialogue that I thought were throwaway lines, only to make **so** much fucking sense afterwards. Basically *everything* Annie says in the grief meeting.  Yeah the entire drive home from the cinema I couldn't stop thinking about all the shit they foreshadowed earlier in the film. That was great. I assumed it was paint thinner or something art related as Annie just trashed the studio. Great misdirection.  Yes plz! u/TrickleDownBot Yeah I know. A crowd of 30 with 6 true horror fans. 25 voted against it as too disturbing. Yay democracy by people who dont watch horror?!? So this means that part where he says, in shock : “are you okay?” Faintly was improvisation? If so, WOW. *Philip: A VVitch Story* Oh god, when you could see the Grandmother just standing in the corner at the start in the dark, I knew we were in for a scarefest for the rest of the film.

I suppose that really was her mothers spirit watching Annnie. The mothers body would have been already put in the attic so her soul would have been wondering the house waiting for the alive cult members to set everything in motion. Yup. Think he smiled at Charlie when she was at the casket too Isn’t that what the weird emblem is? A horse with three heads? One of the things I read about with Paimon, was how he was so keen with knowledge. He would give infinite knowledge to those that worshipped him, which made the head a symbol for knowledge. .... And of the same lineage (g-mom, mom,  and daughter  I may be remembering this wrong, but didn't one of the drawings of Paimon have some disembodied heads tied onto his horse? mine too i was one of them that is such a fucked up thing to say to your kid also lets not forget she tried to set him on fire i bet he always thought this I figured they were making edibles with weed holy shit I did not notice that. the cut from night to day was like a light switch, it felt like we were on the outside of a miniature set and someone flicked on the lights I think it was to demonstrate that Peter is a teenage boy that would probably ignore his sister in a situation where he was going to be around his crush because he wanted to look cool or whatever  To give him motivation to go to the party. I'm sure the mom had the window lock on the drive home While I think the story really goes off the rail in the ends (and is what is preventing me from really loving this movie), Aster set the pieces up really well. 

Also after The Leftovers and The Handmaids Tale, is Ann Dowd the go-to lady for evil cult priestess? I was looking forward to her being a normal old lady :/ Knocked it out of the park. You really do deserve all the bacon and eggs Ron Sorry if I should know this already, but was Charlie Paimon the entire time? Like she was never a little girl and she was Paimon in a girl's body waiting to be transferred to a male body?  No I think they definitely were trying to because a few of the students in the classroom when she was taking the test had down syndrome. And that teacher was a lot kinder and understanding than a non-special ed teacher would be. I don't think Charlie was severely mentally handicapped but I do think she had some sort of developmental skills. I work with children who have autism and I thought the same thing at first.  You could say they all caught a little *Paimonia* There was definitely a lot in the first act to suggest she had psychopathic tendencies, and from the way the movie was marketed, I totally expected it to go in that direction. Yeah I think that might have been the case, In the classroom scene it seemed awfully elementary for a 13 year old, and I noticed there was a student with Down syndrome in Charlie’s class as well. And she said she couldn't forgive him because he didn't say 'sorry' or 'take responsibility'. Like fuck, he's obviously extremely traumatized and *knows* that he was the one who killed her. That whole dinner scene was brutal  I think we're supposed to just think it's like ""prophecy"" rather than planned out. Just fate. Yes, but it's more like a supernatural force that is manipulating everything i.e. fate, so it's not that ridiculous This movie scared me into carrying mine around. Once I got home I immediately put my EpiPen in my car  part of the ritual was them all being together, and them all touching it. That means each was a part of the spell.   
and, as par for it, they just tricked the mom first.   
 I thought it was pretty obvious and felt like the treehouse scene was almost a little overkill and muted my final level of terrified at the end. People were laughing when the lights came on.  I guess it's a defense mechanism, but yeah, way to ruin it for everyone, jerks. horror can be unsettling. People laugh when they are nervous. A lot of people in my showing were laughing, but the movie does inject some comedy. I believe as a release valve. That whole sequence is... I can't even think of a proper adjective to describe it. But from Charlie's death to the brother's guilt and Annie's crying it's absolutely brutal. Possibly the best part of the film is when Peter is lying awake in bed, and the camera doesn't dare move from his face as we hear Annie going out and stumbling upon her daughter's decapitated body and screaming bloody murder (and rightfully so). I had my hand over my mouth that entire time. I think it flew up there with the *crunch* of Charlie's head hitting the post. The friend I saw this with thought her reaction was over the top and abnormal, signifying that she had her own mental illness. I strongly disagreed. Neither of us has kids, but wailing on the floor upon seeing your child's headless corpse in a car seems like a relatively sane reaction to me. Also her announcing that she was running out for only twenty minutes you can literally feel the count down between normalcy and devastation and knowing Peter felt the same countdown.  Part of what made everything so horrific was how realistically and well acted everything was portrayed. I was in such disbelief that I figured she'd still be alive until Annie started screaming. It really emotionally forced you in. As someone who has experienced this...yes.  Yes it was. Shiiiit I didn’t even catch that. Same, you could tell it was fishy when all the trailer scenes were in the first 45 min of the movie Interesting then that Joan wasn't mentioned as one of the newcomers in the way that Annie was. Does that mean she was just coincidentally going to the same grief counselling session before Annie showed up? One of them was also at the funeral smiling at Charlie when she was looking in the casket.  Nice job on this. I couldn’t decide when Annie really lost control... like I thought she was being slowly taken over... but the Steve fire and the extreme vulnerability angle is bullseye.  Yeah I think the book said he was a God of mischief but man that's some intense mischief  Grief meeting speech was full of information! Her brother killing himself because his mother ""putting people in him""? Gah.  “Grandma wanted me to be a boy.” I just figured it was Peter. He looked greasy 24/7 haha How tcan you vote something as too disturbing after watching the whole movie lol. It's the whole point.

 Fuck, I hate the general public. ""Too disturbing"" shouldn't even be a fucking option for a horror movie test audience. Alex Wolf nailed this film. Admittedly, the crying he does after the seance did feel weird but then it hit me in my gut - he sounds like a child because he is one. He’s just a fucking kid and his whole world is crumbling around itself.  So that's it, huh? We some kind of...Satanic Squad? It's her-head-itary. I think there were three of them, too. I think they used something called ""tilt shift"" in film/photography which gives the illusion of things looking really small. Which made some.of the scenes look like her miniatures
 It was great when they went upstairs and she said “hey guys, Peter has weed!” Oh man, dreams shattered. He wanted some alone time. So many realistic moments in this movie. Yes, and it distracted him from watching his sister. Earlier in the movie when she was eating the chocolate bar, the father notices it and asks if it had nuts in it. This is where we discover she has an allergy. If he wasn’t distracted at the party, he probably would of given it second thought before urging to his sister to take some of the dessert that was being served so she could be distracted while he went upstairs for a bit. How does the story go off the rails? I've seen a number of people say this and I don't get it. She was a little girl who didn't know Paimon was in her. She was screwed from the start though since grandma got her early. That's why her son killed himself because he said she was trying to put people in him. As far as I can tell, yes. Well, maybe not the ENTIRE time. Some people think that when the grandmother breastfed Charlie, Paimon was transferred into the baby. But the tics and things, that was all Paimon.  Also when Charlie asked who would take care of her when Annie died, instead of saying ""it's a long time from now"" or something like that she implied Charlie would have a caretaker for the rest of her life in either her dad or brother Were they? I didnt notice that. Though, at the same time, she also was projecting a bit, because she so strongly blames herself. She completely knew he was going to an actual party, not a school thing, and so sent the sister to try and make him behave. 

If she hadn't done that, then her daughter might still be alive. So she probably blamed herself far more than she blames her son, but can't deal with the former, so lashes out with the latter.  All the shocking stuff was shocking, but is was the real grief stuff like that dinner that really brought this film all the way home. The dinner scene was so hard to watch. I spent the whole time looking at Steve like, ""come on bro, you gonna do something about this situation or...???"" Considering the scene in class where the teacher is asking whether it's more or less tragic for a character to have a choice vs. not having a choice, this all seems to be along the main theme of the film. Wait, why were you not carrying it already?! Who are these severely allergic people that don't carry their EpiPens?! Everyone in my cinema erupted into laughter when she flew up the treehouse The lingering shot of Peter sitting in the car in shock after what happened was so fucking heavy. Like it felt like a moment shared between you and the character, both of you are just sitting there in absolute shock. Just trying to process what the fuck just happened.  Also the image a bit later, when Peter is standing in the hallway just outside his parents bedroom.

Hes just broken but also its such a scary shot with the soundtrack of the horrible crying...its just fucking chilling. I had tears in my eyes during that entire sequence, and then again with the blow up at the dinner table. Urgh I was blindsided by the family drama in the movie and never saw a child's death portrayed with such brutal honesty. It really helped elevate the movie from just another 'haunted family' horror Yeah, your friend is crazy. If one of my kids died it would be a reasonable reaction, let alone if i was going to work one day and my childs HEADLESS CORPSE was in the back seat. I like that a lot. Cause essentially it ""hasn't happened yet"". So Peter is just waiting until it becomes real and we experience that sadness with me. Just a great scene all around When Annie was introducing herself to the group she mentioned that the grief group ""helped before"" implying she went either after her brother or father died, so Joan might have assumed she would show up there eventually after her mom died. Also, that scene when Joan caught Annie in the car, she said she hadn't seen Annie in a few months, and she also said that her son and grandson died either four or five months ago (can't recall which), implying she started going around the same time Annie did.  Yea, was going to say that one of the first naked guys smiling looked just like the guy who creepily smiled at Charlie at the funeral. Can't wait to re-watch this movie and pick up so many other things like that. >  I couldn’t decide when Annie really lost control... l

They show it.  They show her start to scream and cry when the husband is on fire and then she just goes blank.   Makes Loki look like Dennis the Menace. Lol in that bedroom scene with Annie when he was suddenly drenched my first thought was, geez, he's particularly greasy now.... Then I realized it was paint thinner [deleted] If an audience voted my horror movie ""too disturbing"" I'd celebrate and ship it. I can't believe you've done this My take on this is the director telling us the house is being watched by cult from the get go, the same way we are looking at the miniatures. the demon cult is set up well but revealed poorly if that makes sense. by the time you figure out what's happening it's kind of shoehorned in. I was much more invested when it was dark family shit. still enjoyed it a lot though Also Charlie makes a comment about how her grandmas wanted her to be a boy, and later in the book we see it says Paimon is preferred in male form. Oh, shit. Forgot about the putting people in him part. Good catch.  Holy fuck, wait. I thought that meant her mom was complicit in getting men to sexually abuse him. I totally misread that line.  The part I didn't get about that is how a post menopausal woman was able to produce any milk to actually feed a baby. Yeah she's 13. Teachers don't act like that to 8th/9th grade kids ignoring their quizzes to fidget with a toy.  Ours too. That shit was just too much (in a good way.) Could've had something to do with the fact that it looked ridiculous. I thought the film really lost itself to unintended comedy in the last 10-15-ish minutes. Up until then it was pretty scary and tense.  The foot finally coming off the brake pedal is what got me.  It was just such a perfect representation of the sheer, shocking nature of what had happened, that his foot would still have the brake pedal mashed to the ground.  Total hats of to Alex Wolff for that scene.  He was great as the boston bomber in Patriot's Day but that scene really must've been extremely taxing. Peter's crying was a small thing in the movie that really made it work in my opinion. His cries weren't the choked or reluctant ones you'd hear from most kids his age, they were absolute wails and sobs, like a child that lost their parent in a grocery store. It really got across just how desperate and fucked up Peter was as a character and how he really wasn't getting the help he needed. One of the most authentic performances of a teenage character I've seen in a while.  If it were my movie, that would be in the fucking trailer.

>Audiences said it was 'too disturbing.' We said 'fuck em.'

OK, so maybe the Red Band trailer... Huh. I didn't get that sense at all. What specifically would you say makes the revelation poor? And here comment at the grievance therapy meeting where she says ""I didn't let her take my son but I let her have my daughter"" or something to that effect. Makes me think with all the statues and pigeon head that the Grandma got to her young but they hadn't advanced because of the rest of the family/ female host To be fair without the context of the twist it was there to fool you anyway. My guess is she didnt/couldnt, aside from transferring Paimon. Most likely Annie let her ""breastfeed"" just to appease her mother, who she knew was basically crazy.  I honestly thought she was younger because of that scene That was something I picked up on, most teachers would have scolded her for that  I think demons in general are just dumb devices in film and no one has really managed to nail it since THE EXORCIST. Like I get the whole ""get in the head"" of the characters and Annie has no idea what's happening and she takes her mom's books and starts reading conveniently highlighted passaged about Paimon but from a film and storytelling standpoint its kind of dumb, especially when they dangle this red herring of family trauma and mental illness being the real culprit of everything.  >red herring of family trauma and mental illness being the real culprit of everything. 

I viewed it as the real culprit because the supernatural elements are never confirmed by a neutral third party. Anything ""unexplainable"" is seen from the perspective of someone with some sort of hereditary mental illness. OK maybe I'm totally full of shit on this but I thought mental illness was still definitely the ""real culprit"" and even though this is a thousand days too late and unnecessary I'm gonna monologue about why;

 When Annie picks up the book with the passage on paimon it said he looks for vulnerable male hosts. Annie's mom, I thought, might have been carrying paimon in search of a vulnerable male host, which explains being diagnosed with DID, but the real hereditary gift was that the women, to some extent, carry and channel paimon. 

The note she left for her daughter in the expositional book read, to me, like she was in it for the long game though, that she knew Annie was going to have to pick up this ongoing ritual, and in the euology Annie said her father had psychotic depression, her brother had schizophrenia, and they both met these intensely terrible ends. I interpreted that as a suggestion that Leigh had been deliberately plotting a legacy of hereditary mental illness for her progeny, as well as passing on the intense trauma of horrific familial deaths, to produce a vulnerable male host for paimon. When Charlie was born vaginated, the subsequent horrors of the movie were, in part, to traumatize Peter who already had a genetic predisposition to being mentally ill/vulnerable, to get him to a place where paimon could take over without too much of a fight. 

In hindsight a lot of the mysteries of the movie were the cultists keeping a really close eye on the family while they engineered these situations too, like when Charlie sees a woman and a fire in the woods, or a woman waving at her from school, or there is one scene that shows the house at night and a warm steamy breath floats across the scene. And if you already have a predisposition towards a mental illness like, say, psychotic depression, the feeling of being watched would contribute to the total breakdown they needed.

But who knows I saw it last night and could be full of nonsense. Scared the absolute shit out of me though.  ",0
73,"The trek across No Man's Land was so ridiculously detailed and horrifying. I liked how Mark Strong’s voice was all you heard and the camera starts to show him only from his boots Richard Madden's performance absolutely crushed me in all of two minutes. Rest In Peace to that one guy Schofield knocks down as he sprints through the 2nd battalion at Hindenburg Line since he never gets back up after that. How shitty the British trenches were compared to the concrete trench lives of the Germans... was a stark difference in morale to me. “This bloke over here thought it was Tuesday”

^^^^”sorry ^^^^sir” chekhov's milk My favorite shot in the movie was the movie. I loved how the movie had these big-name actors in there like Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, but you’d only see them for like a minute. It kinda “un-Hollywooded” it for me. In reality, you really would have only seen these commanding officers for like a minute, whereas in a typical Hollywood war movie you’d stick with them because, well, it’s a big A-lister. I FELT the desperation of Schofeld when he tries to silence that German soldier by putting his hand on his mouth. Goddamn. I’ve never heard an audience groan in unison quite like the hand in the corpse part. I think every person in my completely full theater did all at once. When was the last time that two movies in theaters at the same time would have made as nerve racking a double features as this and Uncut Gems? I really really really need a 30 or 60 minute making of special on this. I need to see how they did every shot. I know at least once they traded MacKay for a stuntman, probably more, and then snuck him back on the screen later. 

The amount of stuff going on behind the camera, and the actors still being able to deliver has me in fucking awe from a technical perspective. And that's not to mention the performances and how tense the entire movie was. That version of Wayfaring Stranger definitely deserves to win some awards That scene with the flares in the ruined town will stick with me for a while. Harrowing movie, but fantastic all around. Well that really lived up to the hype. I'm absolutely blown away. It keeps you glued to the screen the entire time. 

The standout scene to me was the when the Corporal was at the end of his trip down the river and he goes quickly from floating peacefully among the white cherry blossom petals to desperately crawling over water-logged bodies to get out of the river. 

Besides the obvious amazing work of Mendes and Deakins, huge shout-out to the set and productions designers. To create that massive of a set is simply phenomenal.

10/10 The shot of Schofield running parallel to the trench while the first wave of troops sprinted toward the enemy was unbelievable. I’d pay full ticket price to watch that sequence alone. I really enjoyed this movie. There was so much I liked about it and so little I disliked. 

Favorite scene had to be when Will first gets on the truck >!after his friend's death, and the other soldiers are laughing and joking as friends. Will is heartbroken and hasnt had time to process everything, and he is just sitting there with an awful look on face, looking like he wants to burst out into tears!< .  Really powerful scene. Loved the small nods to other members of the British Empire! Seeing a few Sikh soldiers as well as Newfoundland being referenced was a nice touch The sequence where he climbs out the trench and straight up chops for about 300 yds is incredible. Those looked like real hits he was taking when he was running into fellow soldiers.  Reminded me of the Wonder Woman no-mans-land scene (but much, much better). Corporal Blake’s death had me shedding a few tears. They pulled him out of the burning plane the least he could have done was not stab them ""Now, fuck off Lance Corporal""

After Schofield went through hell and lost a friend, that had to be crushing to hear. At least the other Blake appreciated the lengths Schofield went through to get to him.

Also, the scene where Schofield woke up during the night and the lights/flares were going off has to be one of Roger Deakins' coolest use of light. He deserves another Oscar just for that sequence alone The ‘Make sure you have witnesses, some men just want the fight’ comment really had me believing that the Colonel would do something rash or ignore orders, even though no sane commander would do that.

Amazing film, extremely tense throughout.  The sense of danger and anxiety was felt throughout the entire movie. Dude was on the truck for maybe 100 yards lol They did such a great job of humanizing Schofield in the scene with the French woman and the baby. The fire burning created a cozy/safe environment and the tenderness between the two was really well done. He gets his second (or maybe third of fourth at this point) wind by being reminded of his wife and daughter and the departure with her looking up at him begging him to stay was heartbreaking. Maybe my favorite scene pacing was great

lighting was amazing

score was good

editing was impressive 

characters and acting were all done well

basically i liked this movie a lot The way Deakins uses light is just absolutely incredible. We've seen a lot of destroyed cities in war movies, but I don't think we've ever seen >!a destroyed city lit only by firelight and fluorescent flares. In a technical sense, it's astonishing and speaks to his mastery of the craft. In an artistic sense, it's supremely disorienting and utterly alien to see something lit like that.!<

After the movie, I was reminded of this scene in Blade Runner 2049 where the whole thing is seemingly lit off of a shallow pool, casting ripples over everything; then he takes it a step further by moving the light around the cast itself to put them in shadow one second, spotlight the next.

Give the man another Oscar. There were so many ""How the fuck did they do this?"" moments. Like Blake dying in a single take while the colour drained out of his face. My practical brain tells me they used CGI to de-colour his face but it was done so subtly I just loved it. At first I was disappointed that there was a blackout scene, but once I realized it was an excuse for Roger Deakins to shoot at night I immediately forgave the film. And just like that, Roger Deakins gets his second Oscar. Mendes and Deakins like ""single take scenes are too easy let's throw a baby in the mix"" If you don't see ""1917"" on the biggest screen in the loudest theater you are doing yourself a huge disservice. That first wave dude Schofield knocked over who just played dead lol I thought I had some idea of what No Man’s Land may have looked like in my head. Man, was I wrong. 

The bodies sticking out of the ground was horrifying. That, and the eerie lack of music and the camera just zeroed in on our heroes as they navigated hell on earth, was a very sobering scene that will stick with me. 

The whole movie is an amazing depiction as well as a technical achievement. Another thing I loved about this movie is the cherry blossom metaphor. Schofield asks ""are they dead?"" when talking about the chopped down trees and Blake responds ""No, just wait in no time you'll have more trees then ever""

I took this as a metaphor for war and how after many wars the population regrows. Just like how the dead trees gives birth to new life same goes for men. It’s at least for sure one of the most *technically* incredible movies I’ve ever seen. I have absolutely no idea how most of this was even filmed. Just incredible. I swear to fucking god if Thomas Newman doesn't finally get his Oscar for this score... Small detail but I noticed when he went to engage the sniper after crossing the bridge he cycled the action ejecting the spent casing from shooting the pilot.  Insignificant to the movie as a whole but I really appreciate when films get details like that, really does wonders for immersion. That entire sequence in the burning town was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had watching a film. The colour palette being drenched in nothing but black and orange, the use of shading that really made any hint of light pop out, the music, the camera tracking Schofield running through the town...... all of it was gorgeous and harrowing eye candy. But that slow creep through the window is a moment that will stick in my mind forever. MAJOR SPOILERS  


>!Ugh god, Dean-Charles Chapman totally nailed his death scene. The first cry out of ""wtf are you doing"" to him wincing in pain trying to get his shirt off, and the shaky and defiant ""no"" as he realizes he's been stabbed in the gut.
!<

>!A good, convincing death scene is hard to pull off. Kid is an excellent actor.!< The shot of the town on fire was horrifyingly beautiful Everyone in my theater jumped once the rat hit the tripwire, didn’t expect that shit.  Loved the constant terror through the use of Newman’s score. There scene where they all worked together to get the truck unstuck was beautiful. The urgency on Schofield’s face and the quiet understanding of the soldiers around him put the movie back on track to completing the mission

It wasn’t as memorable as other scenes in the movie but that scene specifically had a lot of heart Lieutenant Leslie (Andrew Scott) deserves his own movie. It can be part of the 1917 cinematic universe. That shot of him standing in front of the raging fire while the German soldier walked up on him was a thing of beauty. Also Blake dying so early shocked me. Seemed so out of nowhere that it frustrated me. But I'm sure that was the point. I'm sure many a soldier felt that way This movie felt real to me in a way a lot of other war movies aren't. People who go in expecting a Stalingrad/Saving Private Ryan grand narrative are missing the point. 

This film captures a very small slice of an unimaginably complex war from the perspective of 2 grunts on a mission. These guys aren't special forces soldiers or an elite landing party, they're expendable message couriers told only what they need to know and forced to improvise and adapt to a battlefield where the fog of war covers everything and everyone. The vast majority of characters in this movie are busy doing their own thing, contributing to their own seperate slice of the greater effort, and as far as they're concerned the leads are just random dudes.  

Unlike a lot of other ""war is hell"" films, I don't get the feeling that 1917 was glorifying its subject in spite of the message. In the end the MC >!loses his friend!<, almost dies countless times, is verbally abused by the man who he was trying to help, all so he could stop an attack for a day that may or may not commence next morning. He winds up in the exact same spot he was before, >!this time alone!<. No medals, no grand reflection/monologue on the importance of duty or patriotism, just exhaustion and misery. >!Germany loses.!< i cant help but think that the french girl begging with him to stay must have reminded him of leaving his own wife and daughters for what may be the last time they see him. so heartbreaking After walking out of the movie an hour ago I can't help but feel incredibly moved and sad. I just can't help thinking that even tho this is just a movie made up of producers, sets, lights, and actors that this was set in a time that most of us alive on the planet don't and can't understand. A time where humans killed other humans by the 100 of thousands on orders of men that only wanted to serve their own goals. The movie made me feel for the families that lost sons and daughters who laid down their lives so that we could go on>!(not so dissimilar to how tom died)!<. Truly a spectacular feat in cinematography history in my opinion. Andrew Scott had one scene and completely knocked it out of the park. Phenomenal character actor. It’s weird that you can track the whole journey back to the beginning in your mind. All in all it really wasn’t that far. Couldn’t have been more than a few miles. George MacKay probably gives the most underrated performance of this awards season. After Schofield completed his mission the only comfort he received was from Blake's brother and from the photograph of his family. After this moment of reflection I couldnt help but remember what he said in the beginning,  

""Why did you choose me?"" I’m glad someone was able to make a movie about my PUBG duo experiences where someone dies in the very beginning leaving the other person to do all the work. I found it interesting that besides the one encounter with the German the protagonist must choke, the Germans were seen as faceless shadows. You hear their gunshots, their explosions, and their scurrying, but for the most part, they are the unknown. Even the one he must kill dies in darkness. Best scene was the young soldier serenading his mates in the woods before the assault This movie blew me away. The shot of William running across the battlefield as the music swells,  mortars are blowing up around him, and hundreds of soldiers charge was fucking astounding. God damn I hope Reddit doesn’t turn on this film because I will have to get into so many pointless arguments.

EDIT: as an aside, I’ve seen multiple critics rating this poorly by saying its “irresponsible” to turn war into a spectacle. Did they watch the same fucking movie? There was nothing depicted in this film that made war look like anything less than harrowing The sequence with the barbed wire, the falling, the bumping and the hand into corpse felt like a horrifying vaudeville/chaplin physical comedy routine. Blake: Find my brother.

Schofield: How will I know what he looks like?

Blake: Oh, he's the other Game of Thrones actor. This is some next level shit in terms of cinematography and overall theater immersion. 

Roger Deakins should be a lock for his second Oscar. Go see it. That’s all. Anyone think it's possible Schofield might be dead soon due to a disease?

He placed his hand with an open wound into the guts of a person who just had rats in them seconds before... I thought it was cool how the camera showed us who the actual main character is by following him when they went their separate ways for the first time in the abandoned house. This movie was incredible. I was really skeptical of seeing the movie for some reason. I think it was because I wasn't familiar with McKay and Chapman as leads and all the big names were cameo roles. But I was way wrong. The sequence with them going through No Man's Land. Holy shit. Running around in the village Ecoust, had to Wikipedia that, at night time? It was like walking around in a post apocalyptic world. Like Schofield was in hell. 

The tension just kept building and building. When they were at the farmhouse it felt like I was in the middle of a horror movie and I was waiting for a German soldier to just pop out from behind a corner. Instead he came from the sky. The second they pulled him out of the plane, I could feel a sense of doom building up in me. I don't know what Blake was thinking trying to save that German soldier, like what were they going to do with him? Tie him up and take him along on the trip. I had a feeling Blake would die since he wasn't in the trailer nearly as much as Schofield. I didn't expect it to happen so early in the film. You don't realize, at least I didn't, that Blake's wound was fatal. Broke my damn heart.

Loved the final sequence with Schofield trying to get to Colonel Mackenzie. It feels like he runs through a 10 mile trench trying to find him as the battle is just beginning. It was a weird comedic moment where Mackenzie, after Schofield saves his life by making him read the letter and withdrawing the attack, tells him to fuck off. He's almost disappointed he didn't get massacred.

Just an incredible film. I haven't seen all of Sam Mendes movies, but I think this is definitely my favorite out of what I have seen. I didn't think a movie could be as stressful as Uncut Gems yet here we are

Edit: also that masterbation joke was great Anyone else get a bunch of horror trailers before their showing? Seemed like an odd choice before a movie like this. Anyone else cringe hard when Schofield accidentally put his wounded hand in the dead Jerry? That got a good wince out of me. I thought it was a really nice touch having the protagonist not have any personal to the plot. He didn't even want to go. He couldn't care less about medals and the only family he has is waiting for him at home. But when his best friend dies in his arms it's like he had no choice. It was really heartbreaking The rat hitting the tripwire made me quite literally jump out of my fucking seat. Gotta love that Dolby Digital. Wow, this was simply phenomenal. The score, cinematography, everything was excellent from start to finish. Everyone saying to see it in the biggest, loudest theater you can is absolutely correct. 

Am I the only one who thought Schofield was a Christ metaphor? He gets his hand punctured in the beginning, falls 3 distinctive times(tripwire in the cave, the plane crash, and the stairs with the soldier). He jumps into the river(baptism), then saves hundreds of lives by delivering the message. Man its one thing having learning about how gruesome and horrifying the western front was but experiencing the immersion of being there with these characters is something else man. Phenomenal.

Fellas, this is a terrible date movie. Youll just be thinking about how much you appreciate your boys and how you arent watching them die in front of you. And then Scofield died three days later from an infected hand wound. A good friend of mine pointed something out immediately after the end that blew my mind and has been driving me crazy the more I think about it: ""The whole movie is a palindrome - everything is the same forwards and backwards""

So, we started going back through the plot to support his theory, and this is what we established so far.

\-Most obvious, the film begins and ends with Schofield asleep by the tree

\-Right after the opening scene, Blake and Schofield are introduced, just as Schofield meets the elder Blake brother just before the ending

\-On the way to meet General Erinmore, the two pass by casualties before winding through the maze of trenches, just as after the meeting with Colonel Mackenzie, Schofield winds through the trenches and out past casualties in triage

\-The meetings with Gen. Erinmore and Col. Mackenzie mirror each other and occur at near identical intervals

\-Blake and Schofield being horrified by the mangled bodies in no man's land but quickly regaining composure - Schofield struggling over the floating corpses in the river before finally breaking down and weeping

\-Schofield nearly suffocating in the rubble from the blast in the dugout, then escaping the collapsing tunnel with Blake = Schofield fleeing from the German soldiers, jumping into and nearly drowning in the river

\-The cherry blossoms in the orchard = the cherry blossoms in the river

\-The German pilot stabbing and killing Blake while Schofield was retrieving water at the farm = Schofield killing the German sentry while his companion was drinking and preoccupied in the town

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm certain there's loads more - some of the matches are major plot points while others are tiny details. We also couldn't come to a consensus where the exact ""center"" of the movie fell, but I'm sure it will be obvious upon watching it again.

tl;dr - I think the film is the same if watched forwards or backwards That nighttime shot with the flares in the destroyed city was insane. Felt like some kind of dream (or nightmare) sequence. The entire movie was shot beautifully and the “one continuous take” feel pulled me directly into the action and made me afraid to look away for fear I might miss something.

Edit: flares*. Shout out to that German soldier who, having just crashed his plane and had his legs on fire a couple of minutes ago, still pulls it together in time to >!stab one of the guys trying to help him.!<

Employee of the month right there. The scene where the French woman asks for milk, my entire theater collectively did a happy sort of sigh. It was one of the most wholesome reactions I've felt in a crowded movie theater. Was haunting seeing the color drain out of the guy's face as he bled to death What an absolutely beautiful film. The scenes in the dark with the blown out city were some of the most beautiful movie scenes I’ve seen.

Also, the death scene with Blake was great. Making him paler and paler leading to his death made it so life like. I can't think of a shot that's stuck with me as much as the ruined town at night under flares and fires, it felt like I'd been dropped into a breathing  painting. Anyone else think that the French town shot to bits looked like tombstones under the flares? This film was so surreal; there was an almost maddening vibe to it. When Schofield comes to the church and it's in a roaring fire, I had such an unsettling feeling that the fire was somehow alive, lapping at the wood and bodies cast into it, ever hungry, unquenchable. 

Never has war been this dirty on film. Bodies floated down the river like flotsam. Trees stuck jaggedly out of the ground like glass. Blood everywhere. Death everywhere. And for such a grimy, dirty film, my god—those shots. Roger Deakins is a genius. The entire sequence in the French town especially was fantastic, the way the flares shot up into the air, and with each fleeting moment of light, we wanted so desperately to be cast into darkness, to stop the bullets from firing, because not seeing anything was better and safer than seeing something. 

When I saw Schofield look at the tree in the end, I saw ache, pain, and fatigue eat at him. It was inevitable that the film would end where it started, with Schofield lay against the tree, exhausted, wanting so much to lay down to rest, because sooner or later he would be called back into action, and the whole process would start over. What we saw was just a day. A day. And in that short day, many, many humans experienced more torture and toil and tumult and anguish and torment than any person should ever have to deal with. 

What a beautiful, yet terrifying, film. This is like the first war movie I've seen that had actual Punjabi soldiers. Nice attention to detail. Kudos to you Mendes. The best moment of the film by far was Schofield crying after he gets out of the river. He was never able to mourn his friend, he nearly died to the sniper, he was chased by multiple Germans, and he had to climb over those civilians in the river. All of those emotions that had been building up were finely let out. I felt that scene and it shook me to my core. Just watched it, loved it.

Two things that I really appreciated:

1) all of the people they came across were the big name actors, I'd never heard of either of the main character actors. Had something of a star wars feel

2) the cinematography was amazing. Id love to know how they managed a lot of these single take tracking shots because they made up the majority of the movie

Also liked the sudden death half way through the movie. In hindsight the trailer did give it away if I'd looked closely at it but I hadn't quite expected it to go that way. Really well done. I'll never get the look on Schofield's face in the truck scene out of my head the fact that he looked seconds away from bursting into tears and has to listen to a bunch of soldiers talking and laughing while he's in total agony over Blake's death and the soldiers have no idea what's hes been through he never got to bury his best friend and is expected not to dwell on it Robb Stark and Tommen* Baratheon(Lannister) are brothers in this. LOL. A lot will be said about the cinematography, and with good reason it's absolutely incredible; however, the score is every bit as good. It's harrowing, it's epic, it's terrifying at times. So much of this film will stick with me Schofield's run is going to be immortalized in film history. Fifty years from now, when they make montages of iconic scenes from the early 21st century, that scene is guaranteed to be part of that highlight reel. Any idea how they made Blake go so pale in the stabbing scene? Very impressive effect, didn't know if you can do something like that in post Astonishing piece of filmmaking. See it on the biggest goddamn screen you can find. Just got out, I really loved it. The set designs were incredible, the pacing was great. I don’t know how you pull off that one shot trick across two different trenches. 

Really incredible. 

I thought both main characters were going to have plot armor throughout the film and then they removed that quickly. 

This movie feels like it’s going to stick with me. I really wish I hadn't seen the trailer for this movie. Almost every single climactic moment within the film was featured in the trailer (the plane, the German upstairs behind the door, the dash across the lines as shells exploded...). If I could do it all again, I would have liked to go in blind.

That being said, fantastic movie! I can't get over how well the technical aspects of this film are. The night scene in the city was particularly haunting and beautifully tense. Just got out and not only do I think it’s the best movie of 2019. I think it’s one of the best movies I’ve ever seen period. I’m just in awe. 

It deserves every technical award imaginable. I have no idea how they pulled this off.

Great performance, great score, great choreography, great cinematography. The scene of Schofield running across the front line to get to Colonel MacKenzie gave me chills down my entire spine the entire time.

Absolutely phenomenal. This movie is stressful as fuck Finally got to see this Sam Mendes masterpiece and I always appreciate when a war movie highlights the significance and insignificance of individual soldiers in a real life war situation. You go into this movie thinking Tom will defy the odds and get to the General with the message in time, thus becoming a hero. Yet, he dies by a knife wound trying to help a German pilot. No dramatic fight for his life against numerous enemies or becoming the hero in the end, he was simply stabbed and his life was over just like that. Even though Will goes on to complete the heroic act and saves roughly 1600 lives, he is told to fuck off by the General and thus blends back into the thousands of soldiers and will go back to fighting an unwon war. After everything he had gone through and risked his life multiple times in one day, the war is not over, not even close, and he becomes just another story in a 4 year war. In fact, almost all of those 1600 men won’t even know it was thanks to Will that they lived to see another day, and that’s the insignificance of being only one person. What makes this somewhat better is that Will never wanted to be a hero, since he traded his previous medal for a bottle of wine, because that’s all it was- a bit of tin with a ribbon. I have never been as distraught as I was when the fucking German stabbed Blake after they helped him out of the plane.  The fucking asshole. I just did a re-watch of the movie and noticed something about the ending.

A lot of people have already mentioned that Schofield was just blown off at the end after all he had went through to save thousands of people. But nobody points out just how much congratulations and appreciation he gets from Blake for being there for his brother and offering to write to his mother about him.

I got the feeling that the entire movie wasn't about duty to your country; it was about duty to the person next to you. As is no surprise to anybody, this movie is really amazing. It's technically brilliant, well acted, a great story, the music was incredible and used so tastefully, really it's got a lot going for it. 

One-shot movies are interesting. Sometimes I'm not sure how the format is anything more than a challenge for everyone involved. It's incredibly impressive, but whether or not it's well done or lends itself to the narrative can be another story. Here, though, it works so well. It's like you're taking a tour of another time, walking through horrors we haven't even seen in photographs. 

First thing I noticed was that the movie moves so well that it's just never boring, despite following the same character with few obvious cuts. The setting would change in seconds, the background felt very alive or very dead depending on what was needed, and we still got great side character performances.

The story is pretty interesting. I mean it's basically Dora the Explorer does WWI. The plot is basically, go through the war zone, through the enemy trenches, towards the coast and through an occupied town. There's more to it than that, but reminding us where we were going and laying it out like that really helped ground us.

This movies greatest strengths, I think, are its depictions of war. From the beginning where the guy cut his hand then accidentally put it through a corpse's wound hole I was like oh fuck we are really in for something. Dead animals, burnt bodies, climbing over floating bodies, trench claustrophobia, it's all really well done and a lot of it isn't even the focus. It's just there and we're just walking through it. 

I couldn't believe the guy with the brother died. What a heartbreaking scene. Knowing that once he knew his brother was involved he couldn't stop going, knowing that he just wanted his mom to know he wasn't scared and alone. That scene caught my by surprise, up until then I had perceived him as the main character. 

What really ties the room together is the ending. He makes it, he delivers the message, but that doesn't mean the war is over or these men won't die at some point. But he did it because it was ordered of him and because he promised his friend. He didn't care about medals, he had a higher honor. And the at the very end when he pulls out the photo and on the back it says ""come back to us"" you realize he was on a larger mission this whole time. Absolutely devastated me. This was just one day in his service. 

9/10. I thought Dunkirk would be the best war movie in a long time, but this one's gonna be really hard to beat. Sam Mendes deserves every best directing award he gets this season 10 times over.

/r/reviewsbyboner A lot of comments on here praising the night scene for the direction and lighting, and for sure it was incredible, almost otherworldly, but for my money I'm taking the final sequence of Schofield looking for Mackenzie as the best scene of the film. One of the most brilliant and compelling depictions of the implacable war machine in action. Gives a feeling of futility for one one man to try to stop the wheels once they're in motion. The hopelessness of trying to hold back the roiling waters with your finger in the dike.

And then it all culminates in him rushing alongside the trench through a hail of shells and bullets to save the lives of men currently racing past him to their deaths. Just magnificent. Lesson of the movie: Never trust a Jerry. Don’t have words. I’m just glad that we can still have experiences like this in the theater. Got damn Really liked the movie.

Acting was top notch along with the soundtrack the last 20 minutes were phenomenal 

Benedict's character was right in they will just get ordered to attack the next week as that was when the Arras Offensive started. I had family in that sector at that time in the movie and 29 days after the events of the film 3 sides of my family attacked Bullecourt 20 min walk up from Ecoust (the town in the film) doing what the 2nd Devons were doing. It's so crazy to wrap your head around the fact that Tom dies 45 minutes after he leaves Colin Firth's command post, and SO much shit happens before that. One of the best death scenes I've ever seen. It's still with me a day later. The shock, then the pain, then fear, then confusion. The odd formality of it, then the sudden and irrevocable transition from hopeful young man trying to save his brother to just another inanimate corpse left to rot.

It was horrific and captivating and it felt utterly wretched and hopeless. The charge scene is one of the best scenes I have seen in my life I fucking cried I’m half surprised Blake’s brother didn’t turn out to be Matt Damon. Would’ve make for a surprise ending. Robb Stark works too though I went into this movie thinking it would just be a very well directed action-war movie.  
  
Holy shit.  
  
Such an accidental trip into the human condition and what it means to be alive. There's so much to say about this movie and I'm very glad I saw it in theaters. The last scene made me tear up.  
  
10/10 I saw it about a week ago and I've been itching to talk about it ever since.

First of all, everything being a single take.  I know there were some ""obvious"" cuts (like when it would focus on a rock or a tree would obstruct the view of the characters) but what a goddamn achievement of filmmaking to make this happen.  I was honestly impressed, especially those long walking scenes with a full conversation in the trenches.

The movie is a lot like Dunkirk in that it's just constant tension, and slow movements.  We really don't even see any enemies faces except for the German pilot.  I fucking loved it and it did so well showing the horrors of war.  The slow movement across no man's land, when we weren't sure if the Germans actually retreated, with the corpses, bomb craters, and dead horses everywhere was nerve wracking

And finally, I need to gush about the scene at dawn with the flares.  One of the most insanely gorgeous scenes I've ever watched.  The choreography of the actors / camera / flares, the scene being so tense and well told without dialogue, and then the colors.  The warm sunlight of the early dawn contrasted with the harsh, blinding white of the flares that arced and threw jagged shadows everywhere.  Holy shit I loved every second

Bravo Sam Mendes, bravo. Sweet fucking Mary Moses mother of Jesus Christ’s triumphant cock... 

That. Fucking. Cinematography. An utterly mindblowing feature that had me staring in awe at the screen. As a huge film fan, I find it harder and harder to be blown away by a director's craft. Sam Mendes has blown my mind. I was sitting in the theatre in awe wondering how he's made this film. The precision in execution to pull off what is essentially one sweeping scene is insanity. Nothing feels off, he has managed to make the viewer feel as if they are one of the main characters. Roger Deakins's cinematography is the best of his legendary career. Watch this on the biggest screen you can find.

It's not purely a technical feat, *1917* is full of emotion. The performances from Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are superb. These two young men have this huge film resting solely on their shoulders as the two characters who feature extensively. No one has mentioned them in awards talk which is a damn shame. It made me well up thinking about how young these men fighting were and what their families at home had to go through.

War films often make the mistake of being excessively violent and making their characters feel like pawns rather than humans. *1917* is a film fueled by the concept of togetherness. A film with a big heart and a beautiful message. A worthy Best Picture contender. I loved how the movie started and ended with William resting under a tree. I was struck by the scene where Schofield is sitting in the truck with the soldiers that just happened to be passing by who were all just bullshitting, telling stories. Schofield is just silent, still processing Blake’s death that happened literally minutes ago. The single shot made it feel like you were sharing the moment with him and it made it all the more impactful. Well done. Scofield went to the Prometheus school of running, it seems. Boy just could not find the time to zig nor zag. I was really thrown off then Blake dies so early on. My dad and I were watching together and we were was so sure that Schofield was going to die first. Especially because my dad's a doctor and he cringed immediately when Schofield's cut hand plunged into that dead guy's back.

&#x200B;

But a solid movie imo, probably my favorite. OK, one issue I have with 1917's plot: There comes a point where the main character, after having lost his partner and gone through hell already, encounters a British troop convoy, and hitches a ride with them for a time.  During which, he informs the commander of that convoy that he's on this dangerous mission, and if he fails, 1600 British troops will be slaughtered, and that his partner has been killed, so he has to complete the mission on his own.

Why did not the commander of the convoy lend one or two of his own soldiers to accompany the protagonist on the mission, rather than simply telling him ""good luck"" to complete the mission on his own?  Am I the only one that has a problem with this part of the plot? Jesus, this movie was something else. It was really disheartening for the majority of the time, with one disaster happening after another and the protagonist rarely ever catching a damn break. It was also fucking nasty (like, I expected it; it's a war film after all) but stuff like Will accidentally placing his hand on a decaying corpse and ending up touching its intestines did catch me off guard and got an audible reaction out of me and several other moviegoers. 

However, all of that also meant that the quiet and tender moments stood out so much more. From Will meeting the French woman and the baby to the soldier singing for everyone and making them forget about their situation for a second, it was really beautiful to see and it gave you that tiny bit of hope you needed.

And then of course, the cinematography, which was the main reason I wanted to catch this movie in theaters - and my god, was it breathtaking. They really made it seem like it was filmed in one shot and it added so much to the viewing experience and constant paranoia. I also never had the feeling like I was missing something. So yeah, I was really impressed with 1917 and it deserves every accolade and praise it gets. That scene with the burning church as they slowly walk to each other because they can’t see the color of their uniforms and then the German soldier shots Schofield was absolutely beautiful. I loved the song the guy was singing , good voice The Guy who got knocked over by Schofield A War Story from his perspective would be hilarious.. there I was about to kill Germans when this mofo started running perpendicularly for some reason.. Way too much of the last ten minutes was in the trailer. My only annoyance was the timing issue with the sky getting light very quickly. But you know what? I think everyone would agree that some scenes will stand out for years to come on lists of ""Greatest Movie Moments"" etc. That scene with the flares above the town at night, the church along with the music. The piano score that suddenly chimes in, almost like an eery fantasy film, straight out of Lemony Snicket. 

Absolutely mind-blowing. Yeah man, a suspense war movie instead of an Action war movie. Yeah I think a lot of people don't realise just how dangerous and unforgiving no mans land was. most people hear there was only 100 yards between trenches, and people think they could just sprint it and get to the other side before being shot.

This movies did such a great job at showing how impossible charging trenches could be. I absolutely love that guy and wished he would get bigger roles. He has such a presence and is a phenomenal actor. There were several cool shots like that. When he shoots the flair and instead of following it the camera remains focused on the characters staring at it and then it comes back into frame as it falls behind them a few seconds later. Hearing the planes and only seeing them after they had passed because yet again the camera was focused on the characters. Right at the beginning in the trenches when Schofield falls behind because he runs into a soldier and then helps him pick up his things and then a minute later Blake gets too far ahead and we catch up to him mid-argument with someone. I can't think of many movies where characters interact with things out of frame/focus like that. So many movies it feels like everything else in the world is on pause while what you're watching is happening. It really helped sell the immersion because it felt like the real world where things kept happening even though we couldn't see them. He has such a great voice, you would instantly know it was him! When he goes from the excitement of “Oh, Tom’s here?” to the crushing realization of what happened, it really got to me. Superb in the couple minutes of screen time he had. The movie can be so immersive that you totally forget that they have actors like Madden, Strong and Cumberbatch until they show up on screen it wasn't meant to happen, an extra ran to him by accident, but Sam Mendes liked it and they used the shot instead. made it more authentic tbh 

https://youtu.be/kMBnvz-dEXw?t=591 I saw that too, maybe he decided it was a good time to play dead to get out of the charge.

One of the BTS videos talks about that specific soldier, and how it was a mistake essentially. I guess as an actor you gotta decide how you are gonna play it https://youtu.be/kMBnvz-dEXw?t=588 “Oh no, I ran into someone. That’s it for me, I’m out of commission see you guys in the next war” Difference in doctrine. British were all about offense so they did not want to build nice trenches since they were not staying there. Germans on defense thought they would stay there so they made them better. “Even their rats are bigger than ours!” If you can, go to the World War 1 Museum in Kansas City. Truly remarkable museum and they detail the different trenches made by different nations ands their philosophies What we don’t see: that soldier got demoted for lying to an officer. Poor chap. In my screening (US) he said ""this idiot over here thought it was Tuesday"" and it got quite a few laughs Trying to care for a baby when you're not the mother and you have no breast milk crushed me. Guy at my theatre whispered loud enough for me to hear ""bruh you got dat milk"" Also, he significantly lightened his load by giving the mom all the food he was carrying. He might have sunk/drowned in the river without that. Did he dip his barbed wire corpsey hand in there to drink it? I don’t blame him for doing it but if he did that is not ideal for a newborn! There were so many one shots I’m not entirely unconvinced that the entire movie wasn’t one shot Might have been on purpose.

You're just a grunt running a mission and then your find yourself standing in front of someone almost mythical. Like meeting a famous actor, you really have no idea how they'll really react or how the story will play out. Having Blake die right away set the tone for the rest of the movie.  You just did not know what was going tkk happen.  I thought Blake was the main character up until that point. I like that they all play field/flag officers, as some grunt meeting one would probably feel similar to someone meeting Colin Firth, if Colin Firth held sway over thousands of lives. The scene right before that also just completely humanized Schofeld with the baby and surrogate mother. Celebrating the phenomenon of life and right after that he had to crack someone’s windpipe right after. It was just a stark contrast between those two scenes. There was a theme of untrustworthy Germans throughout the movie. First with the faux retreat, then the pilot, then the sniper, then this scene. God. 

And then he tries to stab him and you hear the knife get knocked away. They’re almost entirely in darkness and you aren’t sure what’s happening...and then you realize he’s choking him while the other guy is stumbling in the background. That was such an intense sequence. Same. And the collective jumps when the rat hit the trip wire and when the sniper first takes a shot at him on the bridge. Yeah, his open cut swimming in disease made me groan, too.  I was expecting that, by the end of the film, they'd have to cut it off, or he'd be delirious with fever or something. Another one was when he hit the back of his head on the rock in the river. I felt the audience recoil at that one. You see him heading right toward the rock and you know his head his already in bad shape. Seeing him hit the rock like that was brutal. 

There's so many movies where several people are horribly killed and no one bats an eye. This movie manages to elicit a visceral reaction from relatively minor things because the characters feel so real and vulnerable. That part upset me. The two lead actors were too damn likable, bad things happening to them was just awful to see. I just wanted them to go home and be best buds in safety in England. Such a sad, painful movie, but it would be irresponsible to depict war any other way. When Schofield cut himself, I felt the barbs in my hand and winced. For me, 1917 made Uncut Gems seem downright relaxing. Not 30 minutes, but worth watching: https://youtu.be/ypvd2LJCJHg The transitions are what I'm interested in. I was looking constantly for them. Trees passing in the foreground covering the entire shot, Falling into the water, entering and exiting the officers posts and tunnels, 

Just the way they hid them so well deserves praise. As the camera panned around the entire company of soldiers, and you see they're just a bunch of boys...it hit me hard :( So beautiful. Got me thinking. Is that song really 100+ years old? That was pure nightmare fuel for me.



Being in the service after going through training numerous exercises and had a lengthy stay in blacked out areas during deployment, sudden light and moving shadows caused by flares or anything else (not knowing what it was then) has always made me a bit uneasy after the fact. I dont consider myself having ptsd at all, but this scene made me so goddamn uncomfortable.



It was great tho. Yeah man that was probably one of the most incredible sequences I’ve seen in film in my entire life. Phenomenal movie. Seriously one of the best scenes I’ve ever seen. It sounds pretentious but it was like a beautiful nightmare. The music, the cinematography, the desperateness and how surreal it is. 

God i just finished it and I’d watch it again right now just to see that scene again. The sheer panic of crawling over the dead bodies and desperation you can hear in his breathing had me holding my breath until he got out. when he got knocked over and still stood up to keep running i got so emotional. apparently it was an accident that they kept in the editing room but it made it so much more real to me. if he hadnt been collided with i would have almost thought it was choregraphed too precisely That scene is where I couldn’t hold back the tears. I suppose that you could call it a sad moment, because Schofield knows they are running into a rigged/losing battle, but it was just a combination of everything leading up to that point and Schofield’s willingness to finish the mission that just made me weep. I’m having a difficult time explaining what at that moment did me in, but regardless, I’ve never experienced anything like that at the cinema before. It's such an amazing sequence that even having seen parts of it in ads and trailers and awards reels doesn't detract from its power. That moment will stick with me forever. Whole movie will to some degree, but that moment especially. >!They were telling stories just like Blake was about half an hour ago too.!< I thought that was the most emotional scene as well. He literally hasn't had a moment to consider that his friend just died, and then he's surrounded by a bunch of friends laughing and joking like his friend was just doing not long before. Just awful. And to see Schofield basically turn into Blake in trying to get the mission done. And the odd black soldier in the background - the sort of thing that look like a bit of 21st-century woke casting but is perfectly accurate The Indian doing a spot on impression of the English superior made me lol Me too, I loved the Newfoundland reference. 

Wish they has more soldiers from the empire, like many WW1 films this was almost entirely white British. At least 1/4 of those who laid down their life were not Britain. 1/3 were from India, the Caribbean or Africa. What was the Newfoundland reference? Don't think I caught it. They were but he keep on going https://youtu.be/8zstq9O5ACA I didn't cry until the truck scene right after, how everyone around you is just normal and you just had one of the worst moments of your life.  The movie is so relentless how it stays with his pain. I loved what Thomas Newman did with the score in that part, it was a quiet ambient/soundscape/underscore and then it suddenly stops as  Blake dies giving that moment extra impact without any music. Blake’s death got me close to crying, but his brother’s reaction to learning about Blake’s death pushed me over the edge. I don't know if I've ever seen wartime death depicted so accurate (what I can imagine it to be like). He has no time to mourn. The war rages on. He only has a few minutes to reflect on it, and we're right there with him. Knowing he has to push on. 
It's these moments where the whole one-take thing really pays off. I attended an early screening and in the q&a, director Sam Mendes said that when Dean-Charles Chapman (who plays Blake) dies and his face goes white, that was all in camera - no visual effects. After doing several takes he was able do it on command. Whole theater gasped when Mendes said that. War is hell. His performance was fantastic, the way he panics when he realizes how serious he's hurt was heart breaking, and then shofield telling him the truth when he asks if he was dying. Sometimes Hollywood deaths seem almost peaceful but this one was just pure fear and sadness. One thing I noticed upon rewatches is that Blake was merciful until the end.  He was the one who told dude to get water for the pilot and urging to pull him out of the plane.

I guess it shows he didn't die a monster while building upon the type of character he was.


Edit: had to edit second sentence due to salt in some responses. The way the colour just drained from his face as he was bleeding out was incredible. A German who is literally on fire. Who just crash landed. Surrounded by English speaking soldiers. The son bitch is marinating in adrenaline, no wonder he stabbed Blake. It was terribly gut wreching but by him did I see it happening from a mile away :( I thought that line really informed how desperate the military command had become.

I was happy that they didn't just make Benedict Cumberbatch some psychotic rogue commander. It was intriguing to see a WWI officer who wanted to fight solely to give his men the best chance of survival. The detached military command would've made them charge eventually, might as well attack when the enemy is at its weakest. >  that had to be crushing to hear

I definitely think it sort of speaks to the reason why William threw out his medal the first time.  He and Tom just had very different perspectives on the war and their role in it. I’m in the Army. Having a superior chat briefly with you then tell you to fuck off was the most accurate part of the film. 10/10 Sometimes it feels like there's no one who is as good at anything as Roger Deakins is at cinematography. Yeah the movie was great of course but that nighttime flare scene is gonna go down in history as one of the best ever. Mendes and Deakins must really get a kick out of seeing silhouettes in front of archaic burning buildings. Immediately after this was said in my showing a guy behind me had a seizure. I thought it was someone trying to be funny and laugh overly hard at the line at first. They had to stop the movie and bring in paramedics for about 15 minutes. It really took the emotion out of the end for me. Kinda sucks. Hope that guys alright though. > ""Now, fuck off Lance Corporal""

> After Schofield went through hell and lost a friend, that had to be crushing to hear.

Not really. In British English, ""fuck off"" basically just means ""leave"" and then they turn it on its head with the whole bit about high command being so detached from the realities of the fighting at hand, and how it makes you feel for him about why he wanted to disobey orders. so well done. I was just glad that Mackenzie was the total opposite of General Melchett's character [deleted] I think they were many instances where you kind of have to infer that they skipped/fast forwarded time. Him with the French woman and running from the town into the river and wandering the trees seemed to pass like 4 hours of time based on the morning light progression. In his general just traveling time I imagined it was more like a couple hours or so rather than just 15/20 minutes because otherwise you would just watch a 24 hour movie where he is basically doing nothing for the most part It seemed to be done very well from a linguistic and historical standpoint too. Both struggling, as both were unlikely to have any language education, perhaps schofield did as he seemed to have a posher accent and spoke decent french. Which would fit for the time.  The spoken french seemed good and well thought out, no google translating the script. At other points the girl simplified her french for him to understand, but as he was leaving she became emotional and went full complex french due to being emotional and desperate. They put effort and thouhht into it. 

Couldve easily just made one be fluent and said fuck it. When she pulled the baby out of the drawer I ghasped, and then we learn that it isn't even her child He had two daughters right? That's what I saw in his photos. For me there was a connection between his two daughters and the brothers (his partner and his partner's brother.) Tasked with delivering an important message and connecting two brothers, while simultaneously knowing the importance of siblings with his own kids, created another driver for him to be successful and finish his mission. 

As a parent, the ending was emotional. It didn't even register that that was a song he probably sang to his daughters. Such an impactful scene. Totally disagree. He doesn't get his second wind from the woman and baby reminding him of his family. They actually bog him down and strip him of all sense of urgency. It's the sound of the tolling bell that gives him the kick in the ass. The woman actually causes him to lose track of time even moreso than he already had after blacking out. I appreciated that she knew enough English and he knew enough French that they conversed in their own languages pretty successfully. I speak a little French and have had a similar Franglish exchange with French speakers. My friend who saw it with me facepalmed when she said *merci* and whispered to me “I thought she was German!” I inappropriately laughed out loud in the theatre at that. They actually stabbed him. I read in this thread somewhere it was all on camera and the actor did it naturally If he got one every time he deserved one he'd have like 10 now. That said, this will probably sweep the technicals. Just showing off at this point really. And a cow! Saw it in the Dolby theater at my local AMC. Absolutely incredible. I'll likely go back and see it in IMAX eventually as well for the expanded aspect ratio. The gun shots are so infrequent yet so explosive. The sound was superb in this one. I noticed that too.



He was hit or nothing exploded nearby where he could have died.... When they left his body at the farmhouse it was a beautiful sad moment of ""just another body on the landscape.""  But we knew part of his story.

So poignant. Absolutely. Also when Schofield snagged his hand on barbed wire early in the film and then subsequently plunges it by accident into some unfortunate person's rotting waterlogged corpse AUGGGHHHHHH It was so realistic though, the men caught in barbed wire, the rats eating the corpses, the flies on dead horses. 

The stories of men hiding in craters or ditches, injured and waiting for nightfall are devastating. Similarly, the story on Dan Carlin’s hardcore history of a soldier sunk up to his waist in mud that other soldiers had to leave as conditions were so treacherous. The following day they returned and only his head was left above the mud, losing his mind. Horrendous. When he was stuck swimming through the bloated dead bodies in the dam i was like “fuck that’s gross” but also “fuck that makes sense they’d all float down the river and be stuck there”. I’m sure there’s a combo of people who were killed in the river and just thrown in the river after being killed to move out of the way. Very accurate, and I’d go so far as to say they may have dialed it down a bit on the gore.  Limbs were a common thing found on the battlefield, as well as “pieces” of bodies. Just hearing the warning not to fall into a crater because they might not be able to get out was a reminder that *everything* they were about to encounter was hazardous. Also of note are the bookends of the movie with the opening shot of Schofield resting against a tree and the closing shot with him resting against a tree. Trees were a prominent theme throughout and I was curious to explore that more and I like your take on it. Amazing they filmed that river scene. I had never thought about it until that moment, but how does the lens never have a single water droplet on it? ""The Night Window"" is probably my favorite piece of film music of 2019. I don't know why it fit so well with the flare scene, but it made the entire sequence unexpectedly beautiful. [deleted] I liked that battle with the sniper because I am the sniper in every competitive fps game.  Get the drop on the guy miss all your shots then he blasts you. And those flares going up and down making the light and shadows move in odd ways was very cool. That scene was so beautiful. Prettiest image I've seen in a war film since the oil field burning in Jarhead. Totally agreed. The way you can tell he's making less sense as he's getting less blood to his brain. How the fuck did they do that makeup  where his face just kept getting paler? Big Skyfall vibes there and when he was in the french girl's home. Not surprising but that's what I was thinking of. Looked a lot like the scene where Bond runs across the frozen lake. I expected the rat to freaking trip the wire, and I still jumped. That explosion felt like it was right in my face. Watching it in Dolby was definitely worth it. Same with the sudden gunshot as he tried crossing the downed bridge. The desperation was real. Glad to see everyone recognize it and help versus being pricks about it. [deleted] Hot priest 😍 ""Well, there'll be a medal in it for sure... Nothing like a bit of ribbon to cheer up a widow."" Probably my favourite line of the whole movie, he was great. He's so lucky that every German soldier in the film seemingly preferred running and shooting their gun than standing still and actually aiming haha I know what you mean about how it's not like other war movies, so I'm just nitpicking here, but how is Saving Private Ryan about a grand narrative?  In a way, 1917 is a grander narrative than Saving Private Ryan, as tens of thousands of people are saved rather than just all these soldiers dying to save one person.  Even the imagery of 1917 might be grander, as others in this thread have already pointed out the Christ imagery.

I actually think there are many parallels between the two movies.  Maybe even some direct nods. Oh my God no fucking way

I'm gonna watch this tonight How do they do in the sequel? After his earlier line where he nearly broke down admitting to Blake that leaving home was the hardest thing he'd ever done. Yeah that scene got to me, he had a PURPOSE at that point. Of all the cameos he was probably the most memorable. They skewed this obviously during the ride in the truck and him in the river. I think they imply he traveled farther than it looks in both those shots. If I recall they said it was 6-8 miles in the film.

Edit: I got 6-8 because Schofield says 6-8 hours. It’s actually 9 miles. I watched They Shall Now Grow Old recently and MacKay definitely has the resemblance of an old face. If you took a photo of him and made it look like it from early 20th century, I would buy it. And the bridge is always a nightmare to cross. I thought it was striking, too, that the German soldier he kills was just as young as his buddy, with that baby face. I think that was largely their point, there. Same concept as Dunkirk and I love it. Dont get me wrong I love other war films where the enemy is shown but these stories necessitate it and means you're even closer to the character for a host of reasons My friend joked “it’s gonna be Ed Sheeran isn’t it” That was so pretty and haunting. He had a good voice Honestly! At no point during the movie did I think, ""this is awesome."" It was always a mix of being incredibly tense and being bowled over by the powerful emotional weight of the images, score and characters. >I’ve seen multiple critics rating this poorly by saying its “irresponsible” to turn war into a spectacle.  
  
I don't think I can ever take a critic seriously with that line of thinking.  There was nothing in this movie that made war look like anything less than absolute hell.  I mean, that was literally one of the only thoughts I kept returning to  during the quieter scenes of Tom and William just walking through the trenches and no man's land, just how awful it must have been for these boys.  The scattered bodies, the craters, the dead horses, the rats.  It was all ugly.  I also found myself very concerned for William's hand by the end of the film lol.  All that death and disease.... Seems like an invalid critique considering how there wasn’t really any politics or opinions going into it. The Germans had a strategy, it was discovered, the Admiral may have been a little war-hungry, but that’s it. The strongest opinion I think was the disgust over killing the plants and livestock

That movie is the opposite of taking war lightly That's funny because I thought Schofield looked a bit like Brienne of Tarth. Then go see it again I expected it to be the clear sign he was not gonna survive the film and it was all Chapman the rest of the way.

Boy were we proven wrong like, ten minutes later. i had feared when he was walking to the tree at the end instead of going to get med assistance that he was going to just lay down and die. then seeing the pictures made me hope he would make it home at least to come back to them :( [deleted] I had the same thought. Wow that's a good catch Also on the ending in the trenches - I like how it ends with Schofield doing what Blake had been doing at the start, running and shoving past everyone. Lol you are not the only one, I think it was antebellum, the invisible man, the turning, a quiet place. So freaking weird. Knowing the lack of proper first aid back then, that is going to get nasty. Yep. Loved that with Blake's death, the mission becomes Schofield's on an incredibly personal level, when he had no personal stake at the outset. Also there's a lot of imagery that makes you wonder if he's dead after the incident in the house.  The hellish imgery, the fountain looking like a cross in front of the building that was burning (church?).  You took the river as a baptism but I was thinking about the River Styx.  Especially with all the dead bodies in it. When he plunged his freshly-wounded hand into that rotting corpse was the most upsetting and dreadful part of the whole movie for me. He's definitely fucked. As a German this scene bothers me considerably. First, this is the first world war. No Nazies. They were fighting the German army, and British and German soldiers had a certain respect for each other.

Second, and more important, pilots in the first wolrd war were all officers who saw this more as a sport (like hunting). Most of them were sons of noble families. The officer would have expected to be imprisoned for a short time and then returned to Germany. It made zero sense for him to stab a low ranking British soldier who was saving him. oh my god why did i just now realize this. I was half expecting Jack Gleeson to show up as his older brother, not gonna lie. Really wish they hadn't shown that scene off in the trailer. As soon as I left the theater I wanted to go back in and see it again and really soak it all in.  Half the time I was marveling in my head at the production and set designs and how insane the whole shoot must've been.  The other half I spent thinking just how awful and hellish WWI really was for these men and being concerned for William's hand.  So much death and disease...  
  
The story was beautiful in it's simplicity and was carried by the performances and cinematography.  The decision to shoot the whole thing as a one-take was something I initially was a little worried might come across as a little gimmicky but it was excellently done.  It felt right in the action when it needed to but Mendes and Deakins also knew when to back off it a bit to let the story breathe and take shape.    It really put you in the trenches with William and Tom and allowed you as the viewer to get a full understanding of how horrible and gruesome it must've been for those young men.    
  
I have to say that Tom's death scene really got to me too.  I was so focused on what was happening that it caught me by surprise.   I had seen the trailers so I had an idea that Tom wasn't going to make it but in the moment I just didn't see it coming.  The next ten minutes had me almost in tears.  Watching William struggle to get him moving, Tom slowly figure out he was dying and the two of them sitting there was just brutal.  It was definitely up there with Mellish and Wade's deaths in Saving Private Ryan in terms of how difficult it was for me to watch.  
  
Overall, I think for me, 1917 is to WWI what Saving Private Ryan is to WWII and it is absolutely one of my favorite films of the year and one of the best war films I've seen. If this film doesn’t sweep at LEAST the technical awards I will riot. Best fucking movie of 2019 and one of the best war films I’ve ever seen, I don’t even care about people coming at me with “recency bias” arguments. This was spectacular. > Here, though, it works so well. It's like you're taking a tour of another time, walking through horrors we haven't even seen in photographs.

100% agree.  I think the one-take can sometimes feel like it's less about the narrative and more in service of the cinematography.  Which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing but personally, I always feel like the story comes first and goal of the cinematography should be to compliment and enhance the story, not call attention to itself. 
  
In 1917 the camera work was definitely all about the story.  Which makes complete sense given how much of a chameleon Deakins is and how his style can change so much between films in order to suit the narrative above all else.
  
Here the cinematography was completely focused on putting the viewer right there in the mud with Tom and William.  You are right in the trenches with these two young men and this was one of the only war films to really make me understand just how awful and hellish it was from the perspective of the individual soldiers.   It really illustrated to me that these guys don't have this big, strategic overview of the war but for them it's just about surviving one moment to the next and trying to stay alive long enough to get home to their families.  It was beautifully done. The final run outside the trench is one of my favorite scenes this past year.  And it should also be mentioned that the soundtrack made that scene all that more epic.  11/10 sequence. for those who have yet to see this film-

this is not an exaggeration. Roger Deakins is a legend. What really got to me was all the bodies left in no man's land. You hear stuff like ""no man left behind, dead or alive"" about (I think mostly) Vietnam and later. But that scene just showed how impossible it would have been to try to recover bodies. 

I think the movie did a very good job of showing the horrors of war without being shocking or showing close ups. Besides when he puts his hand through the German, I think every dead body, whether it was horse, dog, or soldier, was shown in passing. Every dead body they showed was a soldier who had a family who's devastated over their death, but they just need to keep moving. That scene made me realize how dumb I am. I always thought, hey a bit of barbed wire doesn't seem to be an issue, why was it so important then? 
Then the scene just shows literal walls of the stuff. Fuck that. Being in Shazam!, Kingsman, Kick-Ass, The Imitation Game isn't big enough? > everything else in the world is on pause while what you're watching is happening

That's my biggest gripe when less-than-stellar directors/DPs try and do oners. Every little piece of action feels like it's cued specifically for the camera. I was delighted to see how 1917 never felt like any of the action was staged. It felt like you threw a camera into a living, breathing, environment with plenty of stuff happening off screen. Reminded me of Children of Men He then had the integrity and character to think of someone else besides himself at the time right after hearing that news, told him to get some food bc he knew he would be starving at that point after everything he went through, you could tell he was a leader and took care of his men, it was super touching 

Masterpiece of filmmaking in every aspect the acting was arguably as good as the cinematography, music, and everything else Strong and Andrew Scott took me out of the film a little tiny bit, specially since Andrew Scott is my wife's favorite actor.

I think Benedict Cumberbatch and Madden were so good at gelling into their roles. I thought they would be the most jarring, but to the contrary, I forgot it was Cumberbatch about 5 seconds into his reveal. He runs into a few in the movie though. Were they all accidents? Especially since so many men were going to be replacing him with the next wave. He could say he thought he got hit from a nearby blast and it knocked him out for a moment. I wouldn't blame a dude, going over that trench while enemy mortars are landing all around would be fucking horrifying. God bless the souls that have to do that for a living or because Country calls. [deleted] Germans also stayed in the same trenches for months, if not longer. British units were moved to different sectors across the front whenever necessary so they never spent long enough in a trench to develop it Add to this that Germany is holding French land.  As long as they hold French clay, any peace treaty has to deal with the fact that Germany ""conquered"" northeastern France. Even worse, probably lost his beer ration. Yeah the line was idiot I think. Very funny moment. Depending on how old that baby is, you're not supposed to feed them cow's milk (you can slowly introduce it after 12 months of age). this crushed me as well, and I knew in that scene that Schofield was a dad even though he didn't understand the French girl's question and therefore didn't answer when she asked if he had children. I hate that In case you're still worried about the fictional baby. Left hand was cut and dunked into the german dip while he scooped with his(still rather gross) right hand into the milk.

I had the exact same thought. [deleted] I agree it had to be on purpose God, and the fact that they brought up the question of him having children that was never answered til the end. Just tied everything together in the most amazing way. Well yeah, then the whole fuck the Versailles treaty thing 20 years later. That gave me flashbacks of that Saving Private Ryan scene, i'm glad it didn't go there Yes...I only jumped once at the bridge part...yeaaa The person beside me actually crossed their arms and grabbed their heart. He about jumped out of his chair. I thought for sure the movie was going to end with both of them making it through hell but him then dying from that barb wire prick in the beginning. Yeah, I thought the bit with him putting that hand through the dead body's chest was gonna be terminal. It still totally could within a few days - don't know how available proper cleaning materials and antibiotics were in WWI... I'm guessing ""not very"". 1917 has an “ultimate stakes” unnerve where every second is life or death and you’re on your toes the whole time 

Uncut Gems has a more “fuck stop the roller coaster” unnerve where the tension comes because you see an avoidable collision but you keep getting teased until you realize the collision is happening no matter what 

Both are brilliant Yeah, a lot of “soldiers” were kids who were under the 19 year old restriction. When the boys would tell the recruiter they we 16, 17, or 18. They would tell them to go outside and have a birthday and come back in. It’s a 19th century folk song, so well over 100 years old! That shot of him stopping to look at that building on fire was amazing. Beautiful and horrifying all at once. Roger Deakins' cinematography for 1917 was so beautiful. The flares in the ruined town made it look like Schofield was in hell. I noticed the guy he ran into didn’t get up lmaoo it’s like he died from the impact The way it’s shot, and the way the music wells got me emotional as well. When he falls and the camera keeps moving show how far back he was and then he full on sprints towards us was insane. Totally agreed. When i realized that’s what the scene was gonna be I was annoyed that I seen the scene so many times already. But I was so overwhelmed with awe and emotion that I just took it all in. Sam Mendes' own grandfather whose stories inspired the movie was from Trinidad [deleted] Would like to add my thoughts on this. Just came out of the movie and I thought it was really well done *especially* because the non-white British were just... ""sprinkled"". Got me thinking.

Third year of the war, original units lost lots of members, all reintegrated into new units, most of those would still be British, so just one Indian here, one African there.

Absolutely *no* idea if this actually reflects reality in any way, but it seemed like that would be how it would be in year three and not just the filmmakers doing tokenism.

Glad to be lectured on accuracy by someone that actually knows their WW1 though. Would like to know. I believe it was from the truck convoy, they were headed to back up a Newfie trenchline that was already facing the new German line And it made the scene much better and more realistic, other than the first guy apparently dying on impact haha That did it for me too. I felt what he was feeling. And then I lost it again when he was trying to get everyone to push the truck and the pure desperation in his voice. Yes! And he was totally robbed his ability to talk about such a traumatic moment that only happened minutes ago. And we expect soldiers to be adjust to civilian life so quickly! 

So much in this film to appreciate, the small moments that vary up that theme of “war is hell”. I think it was the quietest I’ve ever heard a theater. The showing i was in was absolutely packed and at this point It seemed like no one was even breathing. It was so fucking perfect to the theme of “Best not to dwell on it.” Both of those guys went through so much with Blake both growing up and in war, I was expecting them to reminisce, tell some stories, and finally be able to grieve a little bit.


Nope. “He was a good man, always told funny stories”, a firm handshake, then get to the mess hall and keep soldiering. For me it was when he was looking at the photos of his family in the end, argh, so sad, he just wants to go home! [deleted] [deleted] Yea not even a moment to spare if he wants his friends death to mean something. Then of course the battle was underway already, and the futility of it all really hits in the end I appreciated the continuous nature of the movie in that scene. Every other movie/show handles death briefly, often with some character dramatically wailing into the sky mourning their fallen comrade until fade-to-black.

In real life, there's no fade-to-black moment when someone dies. It's replaced by a ""well now what?"" moment. I thought it was amazing how he used the ""we have to push the truck out of the mud"" moment as a way to release a primal scream and really let out some of his emotions.  I felt like that was the reason they had him try pushing it backwards with his face towards the camera. He's screaming as a way to show he's struggling to push but there's also a lot more there. I haven't seen a wartime death in film done that well since Wade (the Medic) in *Saving Private Ryan*. It was emotional. Damn, how is that even possible?! Did he go into any detail about this? He had to be joking. I don't see how it would be possible for any living person to get as unnaturally pale as he got when he was dying. >""War isn't hell. War is war and hell is hell and of the two war is a lot worse.""

""How do you figure that?""

>""Easy father. Tell me, who goes to hell?""

""...Sinners, I believe.""

>""Exactly. There are no innocent bystanders in hell but war is chock full of them. Little kids, cripples, old ladies. In fact, except for a few of the brass almost everybody involved is an innocent bystander. ""

[Source - MASH ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUeBMwn_eYc) “Small detail” nah, that was the entire point of his scene and his character. He’s a naive, selfless young soldier with trying morals, that eventually get him killed. You didn’t notice that until rewatching? Small detail? That was the point of that scene. It was a pretty obvious  and big detail I think that scene purposely reflected Schofield and Blake's characters really well.

Schofield, the older and more battle experienced of the two, said they should mercy kill the pilot whilst Blake, the younger, naive soldier wanted to save him, which ended up costing him his life. that's what got me immediately.

he was going to get water and i was finally having a nice moment, a break of humanity, and then the screams... This movie had some PHENOMENAL lines about the futility of the war, but Cumberbatch’s speech and especially the quote “next week it’ll be a different letter saying attack at dawn” was the best for me. > I was happy that they didn't just make Benedict Cumberbatch some psychotic rogue commander

Especially after the earlier line about making sure there are witnesses when Will delivers the message. All I could think was ""please dont be a crazy Colonel that says screw the orders because no other leadership is around."" [deleted] I assumed it would be that way, especially after he LITERALLY was ignoring him until he heard the only thing he didn’t want to hear. I loved Mark Strong’s character’s words were true in a way we weren’t expecting tho. I thought it really drove the point home that even though the attack was called off, it wouldn't really make all that much of a difference in the end. All those men will likely end up dying anyway. Yeah, I think they had the second in command throw a thank you and a handshake for audience catharsis. Cause I think, in reality, those runners got no thank you, just tin with ribbons, later or posthumously. Give that man another Oscar or ten. It was utterly surreal. You could square off any frame of that scene and it'll be a great black metal album art cover. That happened to me in the first 15 minutes of Blade Runner 2049 in 3D, the guy right behind me started foaming and vomiting straight up, I thought it was just some drunk idiot til I turned around. They didn't stop the movie, and the man's wife as well as his mother had to carry him out while the movie was still playing. Paramedics came, but they just came to the lobby area. I mean what's the alternative, you just sit there and watch him in silence for 15 minutes? He also got knocked out for awhile which would help explain some of the time lapse And her and the baby are likely doomed. [deleted] It's a rhyme by Edward Lear, late-Victorian purveyor of nonsense rhymes With zero source. It seems incredibly farfetched. He died naturally on set? I honestly don’t think any other film this year could even touch it in the most of the technicals. That cow was totally cgi I saw ""Dunkirk"" in the same way I saw ""1917"" these types of films are really something special on the big screen Turns out he accidentally bumped into an extra and the extra stayed down. Lol Just imagine how many stories they pass from the bodies.  Like the bowing chap, what was he doing before he ended up just becoming a checkpoint. I was happy they put him closer to the cherry trees though. ""Is that a dead dog?"" The fact that he died trying to help him, fucking slayed me. I kept saying to myself "" he just wanted to help"" as the blood kept pouring out of him. Loved this movie. That was probably the worst moment of the movie for me, in terms of the fact that I hated it the most and it made my insides feel bad. I was also sure we were gonna see that hand get amputated. That part stuck with me for a while, which is saying something given I binge listened on a cross country drive.  I can't imagine going out like that. A bullet has to be easier.

The second one was when he describes the soldiers crying out who were heavily wounded.  When a few guys try and get shot, all of a sudden the crying stops.  They go out the next day and find the guy forced his whole fist into his mouth to stop from screaming so nobody else would attempt to rescue him. I'm just glad we aren't in the days of smell-o-vision anymore. I may be pointing out the obvious, I think the trees were meant to symbolize safety/humanity. Every time we saw trees that had foliage or looked healthy there was a sense of calm. The scene in the grove and the soldier singing ""Wayfaring Stranger"" is one of the most blatant examples. 

By contrast, at the beginning of the film the protagonists are resting under a tree, all is well away from the front line. But as they/we travel further and further away from that first tree to the first glimpse of No Man's Land all there is upturned earth, burned trees. Complete disregard for anything living. Someone even said the line, ""Find some cover."" I was thinking ""Where?! There's nowhere to hide."" [deleted] There’s definitely some CGI going on during that river scene, when he falls down the waterfall it looks a little weird, could be that there wasn’t much water there at all, but idk for sure just speculating I was actually trying to count how many shots he fired but wasn't sure how many bullets were supposed to be in a magazine. I'll count again when I go see it in IMAX. Also when they prepare to leave at the beginning they each put a 5 round stripper clip in and chamber a round. It was common for soldiers to only load 5 rounds in the SMLE instead of the full 10 to not wear out the magazine spring, when they put those clips in it shows they know they're in for some shit and are gonna need all 10. [deleted] They actually stabbed him. Paramedics were standing by, but unfortunately, he died. Saw it in 4DX, can confirm shit my pants There’s a great bit of camera work too, where we’re looking at Schofield pushing with his back to the truck, and a few others. Then more help. Then, seeing his desperation, they all get it, they all lean in, the camera swings around and now we see all the soldiers pushing from right to left, pictures in profile. A real moment of unity in a film where the characters all look so detached from others. Andrew Scott: “This idiot thought it was Tuesday...”

This idiot: “...sorry, sir”

Lost it. I liked when he told them to throw the flare guns back cause he hated losing them. I get what he means. The big battle scene in Saving Private Ryan involves the squad fighting an epic battle against the Germans whereas the big battle scene of 1917 involves the hero running away from a battle you don't even really get to see. Trench wars 2: return of the kraut Leaving home *again*.

I've seen a lot of war movies, but that scene was one of the first times I've ever really felt the utter despair of war conveyed through film. I thought they said 9 miles. Blake was killed by the man he tried to save and Schofield had to strangle a young man who was almost considered a kid just to save his own life and the lives of many others. War isn't fair, and anyone can die regardless of your moral character. Not only did the film make war look like absolute hell, it did something much more poignant: it made it look utterly pointless. 

Especially when it's basically stated that high command could simply send a new order tomorrow that will make Schofield's victory more pyrrhic than it was already. 

Blake doesn't get why Schofield would throw his medal away, but by the end of the film, it makes all the sense in the world why that character wouldn't value it. Not to mention the bloated bodies in the river. Those really got to me. Dude the no man’s land scene followed immediately by that German bunker... fucking insane that anyone could see that and have the word “spectacle” come to mind is absolutely bonkers. If someone doesn’t like this movie then of course it’s subjective and that’s okay, but if that is their reasoning then they are just blatantly missing the point Damnit wtf I can’t unsee this now 😂 Why is this so accurate ""You'll be wanking again in no time"" The river being a Stygian metaphor is intentional. Then the soldier singing a hymn about the River Jordan. This is a further extension of the Christ figure. Christ dies, descends to the underworld, and sets the dead loose when he rises. Schofield traverses the Styx to the land of the dead. All of those guys *are* dead *if* he fails. I expected Blake but with a mustache taped on 100% agreed. Recency bias may be a factor, but idgaf. It’s phenomenal and the way the story is told as a “one shot” lends itself to rewatchability for years to come. In Ernst Jünger’s book, Storm of Steel, he talks about how thousands of corpses were left behind in each battle. Not just because of the dangers of No Man’s Land, but also the intensity of the shelling. This movie didn’t really capture how horrific the artillery shelling was- literally burying men and corpses under thousands of pounds of earth. He talked about how body parts and corpses would be part of the earthworks within craters/shell holes. When a battlefield had been revisited and “reactivated”, he even found body remains of soldiers from the previous time a battle took place there years before. 

And yes it is horrifying how so many died needlessly, and in a literal hell-scape. A place designed for the extinguishing of all life. in all honesty in the northern part of france in 1917 there would realistically have been waayyyyy more bodies stacked up.  you're talking about a spot that had been under fire for over 3 years.  Dan Carlin says the ground in many battle spots late in the war was like a marshmallow. It was basically softer dirt because of the constant bombardment, muddy from rain and no vegetation, and then squishy because of all the bodies that have been piling up for YEARS.  

The Movie made a big deal about 1600 men running into a trap (which is a lot to think about) but in WW1 1500-2000 casualties was just a normal day.  The battle of the Somme had a casualty rate on the allie side of over 5000 men per day for 5.5 months.   and that was just 1 battle. There's a bit in 'They Shall Not Grow Old' where a guy is talking about how after a while they would be filling sandbags with essentially a mix of dirt and body parts just because they couldn't separate it out. And it undersold how much wire there was in some areas - you'd have three or four of these walls, with gaps left to channel attackers into kill-zones... Not the lead in any of those. Interesting, I interpreted his order to get some food to be trying to get Schofield awayso he could grieve without embarrassing himself in front of a non officer War brings out the best and worst in men. Mendes said he wanted to cast the two main soldiers with unknown actors. I guess he wanted to put well known ones in positions of command as a way of showing the discrepancies with people who give orders and the people who received them It speaks volumes about Colin Firth that you didn't even mention him. not a few, just two. Yup they were accidents, two of them. Even worst is that most of us (I'm French) didn't willingly go to war but had to defend our land ""Eh, they'll probably cut this take, so no worries. Will just stay down so I don't make it worse.""

Then it goes in the actual movie haha. I mean, it's probably better than the alternative (nothing).. Or they had some masterclass splicing going on. But that was the only point I could see another shot as well, and I also made a point to watch out for it. I don't know all the technical details, but what really blew me away was when the camera pans to see the giant blast crater filled with water, and they go down and follow the edge of the water, but the camera just glides right above the water in the middle. I have no idea how they did that, but it was super impressive, and I think it was in the middle of like a 20 minute shot. So did Schoffield. This for sure.  I assumed he would be without an arm by the end of the film. Antibiotics hadn't even been invented yet, so he's definitely losing that hand and possibly dying from sepsis Especially that late in the war as the warring nations ran out of men. Yeah. It's approximately 200 years old. I also liked the scene immediately after, where he saw a soldier but couldn’t decide whether it was friendly or enemy and had to run for his life in the dark. My friends and I kinda laughed after the movie about how there were dudes getting hit by shells that got back up and kept charging.. but that one guy that Schofield ran into was just down for the count. Having the numbers in the trailer slowly close around his character really takes away from the wider scale that really makes the shot in my opinion. You’re right, they weren’t mainly on the Western front. A decent amount of Indian subcontinent troops were (140,000 by the end of 1914) I guess I’d just like to see their contribution remembered more in Hollywood. 

[source ](https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/commonwealth-and-first-world-war) The British Army was desegregated before the war.  Non-whites just generally wouldn't be made into officers.  Units were very commonly merged as well however. That line on the back: 'come back to us, 🤍' finished me off. He only wanted to go home if he knew he'd never have to come back. Just the idea of coming back made him hate the idea of going home. 

It's crazy to me to think that they even sent soldiers all the way home during WWI, and that as many actually went back as did. Almost every man suffered from some of the most extreme PTSD (before anyone had a clue of what PTSD is, or what it does to a person), yet most had the strength and courage to push through and go back to a literal hellscape. It's unfathomable to me. It even pans over a group of soldiers pissing on the farmhouse where some family once made their home with their daughter at least. His best friend's body dead just around the corner near the shed. Just another casualty of the war He literally died and came back to life every time they needed him to. I think it's probably bullshit, to be honest. At the very least, it will have been hugely accentuated with colour timing.  

Still a great moment. This was foreshadowed when he gave the other soldier all of his water just to wash his face. It’s no coincidence the movie ends almost with the exact picture it opens with. with ww1 it seems like the lesson in almost every battle was futility. we know what's gonna happen but let's do it anyway. [deleted] [deleted] Can you explain that last bit? The village was out in front of the hindenburg line so the allies would have been moving through there pretty soon.  I got the impression it was just German stragglers left behind. The moment that baby appeared I feared every moment the Germans would all of a sudden get in there and kill them both. So the question is: 1917 or Dunkirk? Wait, which bowing chap? As soon as Schofield began dragging him, I was like lay him next to the cherry trees!! That personal anecdote he mentioned prior about the tree’s back home was sweet. Wish they could have laid him closer but I’m sure there was no time The final tree is notably tall. It is mangled all around the lower part. Bark stripped away, with a huge healed inner gash in it. But the top has recovered and green. It took a long time to heal and couldnt out grow it's scars but it had a dignified long life. And when the truck gets stuck in the mud, one of the first suggestions is to chop some wood and stick it underneath the wheels. Which could be a morbid comparison to how they used the soldiers. If my count was right, he fired 9 of his 10 by the time he ditched his rifle. He tops up with 5 in the beginning and never reloads after. It gave me reload anxiety actually. UHHH HELLO!! AND SAM MENDES MATE! That got a pretty good round of laughs in my theater too. Almost nervous laughter considering what movie we paid to see, but still. And then again when he was throwing ""Holy Water"" at Blake and Schofield. The corporals just survive a collapsing cave/mine shaft, so up yours lieutenant.

*throws away flare gun* That line was gold.. it really makes me appreciate frequent collaboration between directors and actors. > it made it look utterly pointless.

The scene in the truck really highlighted this to me too.  As the soldiers who are sacrificing their lives just look around and go, 'why? why do we even want this?' Yes!  That scene was rough, watching him try to stay afloat and move towards the shore before just collapsing into tears. > they are just blatantly missing the point

Almost to the level of it feeling like intentionally troll baiting and trying to stir up fans of the film and make them defensive.  Seriously, that bunker scene felt like a horror movie.  Never did this film feel flashy or like it was just reveling in the action.  I actually thought the action felt far more reserved than I expected from the previews. “Wrong hand” The image of this is killing me. Imagine such a perfectly made movie only to do something so half assed like that. I did expect it to be him with some sort of special effect or makeup to make him look older since he said his brother looked like him but older. Now I want to see some parody version with this taped mustache Ngl that would have been hilarious. I just saw the movie and I agree they should have upped the stakes but at the same time it would be harder to explain how you couldn’t stay in contact with say 10-20,000 men. I thought the same thing, it was an understanding between the two that Schofield had an excuse to leave Blake to his grief, no more needed. I was gonna say ""Tommen is an unknown actor?"" but the fact that I don't know his actual name kind of proves your point. If there is any movie to be cavalier about “they probably won’t need this take”, it ain’t this one lol.   They did have hidden transitions to have more cuts than you’d think, but even then, every shot was such a long, elaborate production. This is true. Just cringed because that fact was reiterated time and time again during my pediatrics rotation. Didn't help that he put his dirty hand in that milk to drink earlier too and that the milk was not pasteurized. I think Mendes has said that the whole movie is like 40 shots spliced together or something like that. Most of the cuts are hidden in camera pans or when an object passes in front of the camera like a pole or large rock or something. There was a shot near the end when he was holding something over his shoulder and the fingers of his left hand were entirely black. Not sure if you ever see it again after that but I got the impression his hand is gonna have to come off... Not definitely, humans are resilient bastards. Unlikely though. Made me realize how many times that sort of thing must've happened in the front lines! There was something haunting about the other soldiers body language during that scene as well Yeah the whole five seconds they were squinting at each other to see if they were friend or enemy was insanely tense. The way that guy started walking toward him after they had stared at each other for a few moments was just perfect. His gait was so slow but was an equal combination of apprehension and stalking. Felt so real and was absolutely terrifying. Gotta find a way out of the fight, somehow. Was probably a football player before the war. Just an extra that really fucked up, ""fuck! I hit the lead!... Just lay here and hope they don't say anything."" Incredible. I read that in a press tour it was revealed that Chapman refused to use a blood pack so they actually had the German actor stab him in the gut with a real knife for the scene. There were several blood transfusions and trauma medics on set standing by because it took them a few times to get it right but it really just shows how dedicated everyone was to the authentic experience of getting stabbed Man he went from regular skin tone to sheet white in like 30 seconds. It was *very* disturbing watching Blake die in real time. Reminded me of Wade in Saving Private Ryan. Did not even catch that dude! Definitely gonna have to go see this again, feel like I missed a lot of stuff from Mendes! I'm sure others caught this too but IMO it represented how he was probably doing something like this before he was chosen to help deliver a message. He received a medal and traded it for wine which shows he has been in this war for a while (my WW1 knowledge is weak here) and has been through days of hell. When it ended with that final scene it just told us it was just another day. April 7 1917. That hit me pretty hard. Just did some quick googling and apparently the war will not end for another year the movie is set. Really if you look at it, you're glad that Schofield was able to complete the mission and he was alive at the end but it absolutely did not have an impact in the grand scheme of things. Like Col. Mackenzie said he might have been given orders to stand down that day, but the next day or next week, new orders will be given and his men will die all the same. I love how it feeds off the cyclical nature of war and the delaying of the inevitable. The other line that stood out to me about trench warfare specifically was when he was on the truck driving through no man’s land and it’s basically just a prairie and a small farm. One of the soldiers goes “3 years of fighting for this? We should’ve just let them have it!” And it’ll be two more young soldiers sent through hell to deliver it. I think he might be referring to “make sure there are witnesses when you relay the orders” IIRC, the German Army left loads of snipers, saboteurs and other parties to slow down the British/French, as well as conducting a minor scorched earth policy when falling back to the Hindenburg Line, as we saw in the film with the booby traps and the felled trees, animals being slaughtered etc.

There were probably a few AWOL or rogue German soldiers who got mingled with the above group.

Dan Carlin's Hardcore History - Blueprint for Armageddon 

First World War by H.P. Willmott

Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914 by Sir Max Hastings They're both great but 1917 is on a whole different level. The one on the barbed wire after they pass the horses during their trip through no Man's Land I got 9 as well, though like you wasn't 100% sure if I counted right as that scene with him pushing the building was tense. Hell the whole movie was. And Thomas Newman did the score I think I misunderstood the use of the flare gun. I thought he was suppose to use it when someone got hurt. Why did he use it? The astronomical and near unfathomable number of total causalities of WW1 sure dwarves a number like 1600 mathematically but it’s a daunting number of lives to place in the hands of two men. Throw in the fact that his brother is over there and the stakes felt perfectly high for me. Shit that was tommen wasn’t it. He looked familiar just couldn’t place him. So tommen and robb play siblings in this lol I watched the movie and thought he looked vaguely familiar but did not realize it was Tommen’s actor until a few days later while reading about the film online.

I think the few years in between the filming for GoT Season 6 to the filming of 1917 made enough of a difference for his casting not to be jarring to any GoT fans. Season 6 was filmed in 2015 when the actor was only 16/17 compared to 1917 when he would have been 21/22 during filming. That can make a big difference for someone so young. Especially for a recognizable face like Tommen’s who was probably 13/14 when he first appeared on the show Is that something they would’ve known back in 1917? A person a couple seats down from me when I watched it said out-loud that ""it's not pasteurized"". made me chuckle There were a couple places that were kinda obvious, like the bunker explosion, the waterfall, and a rock in the way of the camera. However, I definitely counted fewer than 40 of those, and even obvious locations are only obvious because it would make sense to put the cut there, not because they it looked janky. I genuinely thought the entire first 15 minutes was just one shot and was increasingly getting agitated just to wait for the cut, it never came... Once I thought “Goddamn this is really going to be one-take, the movie” I tried finding the cuts. Some were obvious like the cut to black and the waterfall, others I spotted were entering No Mans Land with the foreground completely passing through the screen, a whip pan somewhere, and the explosion.

It’s amazing how little cuts they did have. This extremely difficult style isn’t so much a director going “Look at what we can do” brag like some one-takes are, which are typically action, but powerfully serves the story by giving us an endless, easy to follow window into a couple soldiers trying to do their duty and go through hell. 

At this level it’s basically a multi-million dollar wartime play set across France. Still absolutely impressive and really elevated the film as a whole. Fucking hell I just stared at the screen while the credits rolled for like 3 minutes lmao I distinctly recall a story from WWII where a paratrooper landed in the dead of night in France, and trying to link up with allies, accidentally linked up with a German soldier. The two patrolled together completely unaware of the other's faction, until the German spoke and the paratrooper had an ""oh shit"" moment and gunned him down.

Not sure if I believe it, because German and American helmets, uniforms, and weaponry were VERY different and immediately distinguishable. Especially the helmet. But honestly, if it was pitch black at night and I was scared as shit because I knew there were hostiles in the AO and found someone who didn't shoot me immediately, I'd probably trust they were an ally too. It vaguely reminded me of the scene in Platoon where you see a silhouette of an enemy soldier in the corner of the screen waving his hand before the first ambush. Yeah I just figured he decided to play dead instead of running towards certain death Yup. He's been so battle hardened by this point that he knew not to trust the German pilot when he crashed but Blake insisted they help him instead. That's why he was alive at the end and Blake wasn't. Pretty sure they mentioned that it was the Somme, which occurred in 1916. yep lose 5k men to gain 100 yards that you'll lose tomorrow. Yep and the emotional manipulation of sending the brother. You know chances are he'll succeed or die trying Love seeing someone cite their sources in a Reddit comment. It’s cool how you guys automatically counted the shots on your viewing.  I wouldn’t even think to do that! He gave it to them to signal if they were able to get across without any trouble. To signal they were safe... i.e. the German frontline has retreated Even if they did, I doubt a grunt would have the forethought to not stick his hand in there in case a random baby pops up on the front line. No and actually the invention of pasteurization was one of the biggest single factors in the reduction of infant mortality we saw during the 20th century. That would infuriate me during such a tender moment. There was one as they climbed the hill before they entered the German subterranean system. Another was when he gets to the singing troops and nobody is on the screen. When there are no characters on the screen you can usually assume there’s a cut. When the view was on the crashing plane before it crests the hill too. I think people carrying a box walk across the screen right at the very beginning of the movie after the two stand up. Very cool to see the subtle opportunities they took to cut. [deleted] Jesus Christ war sucks. One second you just patrolling with your ""friend"" and next thing you're gunned down. Oh my god. It really was just another day for him. Jeez. There's a crushing line in Ken Burns' Vietnam documentary where a veteran says that they spent so many men and resources to take control of a hill--it was literally just a number like ""Hill 538"" if memory serves me--and the solider said **""We took the hill on the fourteenth, some apaches came in and got us off the hill on the fifteenth, and I doubt there's been an American on that hill since.""** (paraphrased) It wouldn't be a stretch to say that 0 of the characters we saw in the movie live for another year. I think they just dramatically condensed distance in this movie (which makes sense). World War 1 commanders are sometimes derided for not participating in the action, but it is argued that because of the advent of radio, and because of the wide fronts they were responsible for, it made most sense for command posts to be *behind* the line and connected to the front by runners and radio (until the radio lines were cut by shells).

&#x200B;

Note: I'm not a historian. Just boys, man. In both sides.
Could have been great friends if not for the war, really heartbreaking Yeah if he was at the Somme then he already saw the most fucked up parts of the war. But losing a friend so close to you must’ve been tough. It made me tear up. Can’t imagine what it was like being in that war. Must’ve been the worst soldier experience ever. ",1
126,"Very thought-provoking movie. The conclusion left me feeling so sorry for Eddy's father. At first, it seemed like the story was suggesting that the unethical aspect of what happened was that the families weren't told about the true nature of the study and were unfairly deprived of each other. And while those parts were horrible, I think the worst part was that three men and their families had to endure the indignity of being treated like a subject in a parenting experiment. Like many parents, Eddy's father had to cope with the suicide of his child. But unlike other parents, he also had to face the scrutiny of being compared to the fathers of the other two 'identical' men, as if the suicide had to be directly attributed to his parenting style. I thought that was horribly unfair. No one becomes a parent expecting to be have their parenting style judged as if in a controlled experiment... even the 'best' of parents can't stand up 100% to that type of scrutiny or avoid all tragedy. Just got back from seeing it too so I need a little time to unpack everything but it was a very well done documentary. There was a bunch of holy shit moments 

EDIT: in regards to the research assistant. She seemed really funny and interested YET she seemed to have little to no empathy for the studies being done to these children and it kind of puts her in a bad light.  I agree that there wasn't enough on the older adopted sisters. Can you imagine finding or orchestrating families with different incomes, all having an older adopted sister of the same age, and all from the same agency?

What about the murder? How can they just glaze over that and not really explain it?

I was curious about their ""troubled childhoods"" and psychiatric help. And about Eddie's behavior before he met the brothers. What was he like? Would that help explain the suicide? At the end one of the brothers seemed to subtly blame Eddie's dad's strict parenting style. That seemed unfair to me but I don't know any other information.

Also I'm wondering if the study was picking birth parents with mental health issues or if the two twin sets is just a coincidence. Of course that's something that we could learn from finding the other twins. But it makes more sense to me that the purpose of the study was to look at children of parents with mental health issues than studying parental practices. The parental practices idea only came from that one guy who left the study so maybe he didn't know a lot.

I was curious if any lawsuit was pursued. Was any law broken by the agency not letting the parents know all the conditions of the study? 

Has anyone been able to find any other information outside of the documentary? I could only find a couple wiki pages but they didn't say much.  The champagne popping part was the oh shit for me. Of course at the time it just seems odd, what did these people just get away with? Now knowing everything we know now.... it gets really dark for me. I used to be a conspiracy theorist and hate that this movie rustled long dormant parts of my brain awake. HOW DEEP DOES THIS GO???? WHERE ARE THE DOCUMENTS??? Kidding kinda. All in all a heartbreaking movie that i was hooked to the entire time. 9/10 1.  I don't know what to make of it.  He was unethical in the extreme, whether it had to do with what he experienced or not.
2. I think that's part of the power of the film.  How could this have happened?  Why is it still being suppressed?  Who's behind all this?
3. No, I thought she was a fucking sociopath, with her attempts to justify what was done to these boys and who knows how many others.  At least the other research assistant allowed that he ""might"" have been ethically compromised.
4. The boys' smiles.  Truly capable of lighting up the darkest of rooms.
5. ""Oh shit,"" and ""You're fucking kidding me,"" and ""No fucking way,"" and ""Oh. My. Fucking.  God.""   Not since ""Brokeback Mountain"" has a film gotten so under my skin.  And this was a documentary!
6. Well, this was all before DNA testing, and DNA testing is dependent on who participates.  So the impact could have been profound, or it could have been negligible, or it could have been moot.  In temporal context, it was moot.  
 Thanks for the questions, though.  I saw the movie alone, and I don't know anyone who's seen it, and I'm DYING to discuss it! Ok, I was waiting to hear from any adoptees, as I am. Given to an agency, went to a foster family for 6 weeks, then adopted with my ""forever family"". 

This research was disgusting on so many levels. I was appalled, shocked, dismayed, distraught.... Think of this from the adult adopted child viewpoint. We had no say in the matter, none. 

Children were commoditites. This film got me thinking. Was the OB/GYN doc/ hospital involved in referring pregnant Moms to this agency. Was the mental health practitioner given something for referring his /her pregnant Jewish patient to this ""researcher"" . Why didn't we get to find out what the agency was toasting. You guessed that the parent overheard. 

Finally, they searched for the birthmother and found her. What about birthdad? What about the 4 sets of twins that weren't notified. I hope a class action lawsuit comes out of this.  [deleted] I’m late to the party, just saw it. 
I just don’t think scientists thought as much about ethics at the time (think about the Stanford Prison Experiment).  We still want to understand nature vs nurture. 

5. Most of my “oh shit” moments came late in the film: the siblings and parents were part of the research design, the report won’t be unsealed until 2066, there was no consideration or warning of biological mental illness.  I see there was an AMA with the director a couple of days ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/91i3o6/im\_tim\_wardle\_director\_of\_the\_documentary\_three/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/91i3o6/im_tim_wardle_director_of_the_documentary_three/)

Some quick recaps, reading it:

\- they couldn't film the rest of the family (say the adopted sisters), since the crew was based in the UK, and they had restraints with their budget and scope.

\- the journalist in the film has a theory that the results could have undermined some basic teachings of Freud, and that is part of why Neubauer tried to bury it.

\- ""We also heard from another twin pair adopted from Louise Wise Services who approached the JBFCS and asked if they were part of the experiment and were told 'no'. They later spoke with Lawrence Perlman (the psychologist in the film) who had notes on them from when he came to study them in their homes when they were children(!) So I don't have all that much faith in the JBFCS when they say they are now going to do the right thing.""

\- ""I was trying to leave the nature/nurture question open to discussion - obviously it's some combination of the two. The ending is trying to say that nurture is much more significant than some of the earlier material in the film would suggest.""

\- ""Jewish people I've talked to at screenings and they are pretty shocked and angry about the story. My wife is Jewish and she finds watching it pretty tough.""

\- ""One of the most frustrating things for many of those involved (including the triplets) is that no findings were ever published - all this damage was done to people's lives, and no knowledge has come of it. In this way it reminds me of the Project Nim study"" Fantastic movie!  But I left wanting to know much more about what became of Robert and David. What are they doing for a living now?  What kinds of families do they have?  What prompted Robert to leave the Triplets restaurant? What kind of relationship do Robert and David have with each other now? Just came home from seeing this. Such a great documentary. I loved how the director was able to craft a tight 90 minute film with no narrator. It was all participants and news clips without a ""voice of god"" to come in to advance the story. Brilliant filmmaking telling an incredible story.

My responses:

1. The Nazi tests were about direct torture. In contrast, this was about observing orphans being adopted by loving families. Not saying it was ethical, but to a psychiatrist in the early 60s, I can see it being a benign way to finally figure out nature v. nurture. I bet a Nazi comparison wouldn't have even crossed his mind.
2. I think the movie concluded fairly resolutely that nurture is more important than nature. The similarities the brothers had were superficial. One of the relatives stated that our genes might try to sway our direction, but in the end, the way we are raised is more important.
3. I liked both research assistants. At least they had the courage to speak in front of a camera. Acknowledge that it wasn't ethical now, but it was also the 60s, things change and it was all considered good science then. It doesn't show them in their best light, but I salute them talking when obviously no else would.
4. Hard to pick one favorite scene. Maybe the father getting teary eyed talking about his son's suicide. Up to that point he was presented as kind of a villain. In the end, you realize we are all human. We try our best, but we also fuck up and live with regrets.
5. I was thinking ""oh shit"" pretty much every 10 minutes.
6. I'm sure since the film came out, more people have found a lost twin they had no idea existed. As [GEng7](https://www.reddit.com/user/GEng7) said, if I was adopted through the Louise Wise Agency and filmed as a kid, alarm bells should be going off. I have to say I wasn’t a huge fan of this movie. I felt like it would have been better off as a multi-part podcast where they could fully go into the different storylines such as the murder and the sisters in each of the triplet’s adopted family. The movie also felt rather slanted and while I agree with the side it took, it would have been good to hear a little more from the other side and justifications for the experiments. A few thoughts on this extremely compelling movie.  Can't get it out of my head.

1.  I suspect that the psychologist rationalized the study something like ""they'll never know what they are missing (by not growing up with their twins/siblings), and we'll gain insight into \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (whatever they were studying).""  Obviously morally wrong to most people, but consistent with his (the psychologist's) own self-interest.   This flaw in human nature is understudied and ripe for development.  
2. If I were jewish, adopted, and grew up within 150 miles of NYC, I'd be thinking about whether people came to my house and filmed/tested me on a periodic basis.
3. My take on the nature/nurture question is that the nature part (all were wrestlers, smoked, had great smiles, etc.) was somewhat generic, maybe on the superficial side.   Listening to their wives and why they liked one or the other, listening to the triplets themselves, listening to the discussions about why Eddy committed suicide, reveals that they were clearly different personalities.  That's only one dimension of each one's uniqueness.  One other key aspect is the nurturing aspect of love.  We don't have enough data to say too much conclusively, but I came away with a stronger conviction than ever that it's critical to love your people with all your heart.   That doesn't mean discipline should or shouldn't be part of the equation.
4. Even identical twins and triplets brought up by the same parents have different personalities, different ways of addressing challenges in their lives, and different ways of expressing and receiving love.   So it's hard to believe the motivation behind the study was nature/parenting related nurture alone because even when circumstances are such that the children should develop close to identically if it's possible at all, they don't.   
5. Perhaps the reason why we haven't seen a study report is that it takes a lifetime (and maybe more!) to understand the full ramifications of the different upbringings.   At one point the psychologist probably became too old to continue, the study participants became to old and self aware to participate in these tests and observations without being brought in to what was going on.  And of course when the triplets found each other, it would have disturbed any findings from then on anyway.   
6. One other consideration is that the study organizers may at one point have become aware of their own potential liability and decided to fade away quietly. To answer question 3, the research assistant is Natasha Josefowitz. I had never heard of her, but she is interesting. She is 91 and continues to lead an engaged life (I mean, how many 90 year olds have their own personal website?). But, eh, I don't even want to touch upon how complicit she might have been in the brothers' mistreatment. I mean, she was new in the field, it wasn't her study, it seemed like a good idea at the time, etc. Ok, I guess I just ""touched upon it"". Still, a very interesting life, and a good addition to the film:

[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/dr-natasha-josefowitz](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/dr-natasha-josefowitz) Nice article about splitting twins in light of this movie:
https://theoutline.com/post/5551/three-identical-strangers-twins-parent-trap

""Towards the end of Three Identical Strangers, the boys’ aunt says something striking: 'Coming from the Holocaust, our family has a knowledge that when you play with humans, you do something very wrong.'"" Saw it yesterday.  I thought it was great.  I really like how the film just laid everything out there and left the viewer to draw their own conclusions.  I thought it was interesting that the excuse the research assistant used about it ""being a different time"" for why they thought it was ok to separate the children.  Jesus - it was ok to screw with people's lives with a secret research experiment in the united states only 50 years ago?  That doesn't hold water.  These people - especially Neubaur - were messed up.  I would still like to know what they were trying to learn.  When they revealed that first placing a single adoptee into the families a few years prior to the separated twins being placed there was a part of the experiement it showed  how mind-numbingly manipulative of everyone involved they were.  These were professionals that were supposed to observe human subject protocols.  Damn, the more I think about it, the angrier I get.  How can anything else this ""world renowned"" scientist did in his life be worth anything after the ethical lapses exposed in this film? What I don't understand is, why did one triplet go to a college as a freshman where his brother had already been there a year as a freshman.  They're the exact same age.   Did the parents hold Eddie back a year?  Did he take a year off.  That wasn't really covered. Just saw this today and it has stuck with me the rest of the evening. What a great film/story.  

1.  I have to think he thought it was a totally justifiable experiment but I too found the nazi similarity interesting. He had clearly different motives for his research, but ultimately didn't hesitate to experiment on humans too. IMO the experiment is heinous, but I think the idea might have merit. What if you could conclusively determine how to be a better parent and how to provide the nurture that seems so important.  But that is moot if you dont complete or publish your research. I found that the hardest to digest. He already did the awful part, why not publish?

2.  I felt like it's too hard to say definitively that nurture wins over nature, but I think the be as t conclusion I would draw is nurture is a vital part. I think there are SO MANY questions left unanswered, but the most important one is who was involved that still doesn't know they were?

3.  I thought I was going to, but ultimately no. I get the idea that we can't fully judge decisions made in the past with our morals or ideals of the present, BUT even in present day she seemed to not really care about the negative of their research. 

4.  That's a hard question. I enjoyed the film immensely, but I guess my favorite part is when you find out they're going to get access to the research. 

5.  I did, a lot.  

6.  I guess it depends on if your potential twin also did DNA testing.   I hope people realize that this is a grain of salt on the tip of the iceberg when it comes to human experiments in our current society.  Having bipolar disorder and coming from an unstable environment I often wonder if my disorder would have ever come to the full fruition that it has if I had a more stable and less abusive environment.  So during the film my thoughts varied as each layer of the story unfolded.  When they introduced the female twins and pointed out the similarities for both groups I felt comforted - in that I was always going to be this way and I have no control over it and it's okay. Then they went on to focus on Eddy and the differences between the triplets and I went back to thinking ""well, maybe I would have a different outcome if so and so hadn't happened during my early development and adolescent"".   It reminded me a lot of ACES if anyone has ever studied or applied that to the work they do (I work with youth). 

I wonder if Louis Wise Services ever expected anyone would find each other naturally.  I'm just going to put this out there...  This film is constructed so tightly that there doesn't seem to be a single unnecessary scene.  So why do they spend time showing the Research Assistant's photos with all these powerful politicians?  More to the point, how has this one random woman been able to meet all of these powerful people?

So what is the director of this very tightly-constructed story trying to tell us through that digression? Didn’t like the research assistant. She seemed to happy to have met all those crazy liberal people. What they did was fucked but I don’t think it had anything to do with Eddy’s death. In general I feel the stuff in that research is probably worthless except for the identities of those twins involved. Otherwise I doubt they gained any masterful knowledge from watching toddlers draw pictures. I think Eddy’s death was a result of them getting famous and him not being able to handle it.  So well done and interesting!!!! I was shocked many times in the film, I hope this gets traction for awards!  It's interesting how when I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was a fun, crazy story of three triplets separated by birth who found each other later in life. I figured this meant that they were adopted by different families who were never told about being triplets, but what didn't occur to me is that this would be inhumane. I'm sure I'm not totally alone here. 

I feel like after watching this documentary, it's pretty clear that separating them had a huge negative effect on them, but like the woman involved in the experiment's said, I would have never thought that it would be a really bad thing to do. However, I don't know much about psychology in that area. It is a really interesting study and I see why they would want to do this experiment, I just wish it could have been performed in a more humane way. Anyone else have thoughts on this? Which kid was responsible for the murder? Was it Eddy? because that would help explain the suicide. Unless they're a sociopath I'm sure they feel deep regret over that as an adult. Otherwise decent people can do fucked up shit as a kid, especially when they're consumed in a world of peer pressure, and drugs. 


Not saying any murderer deserves forgiveness or empathy, but I'm sure there are plenty of adults out there that got peer pressured towards being involved in something fucked up as a kid and it haunts them to this day.

Both the assistants gave me a very bad vibe, also I hate to say it but Eddy's father. I mean obviously he's a very old man, but he just seemed to lack emotion. He said he'd wish he had taught Eddie more things, but one of the conclusions of the story was how important growing up in a nurturing environment is. The most important lesson in life is to love yourself first, and when you grow up around strict parents that are never satisfied and show little emotion that can make that difficult.  There's obviously more about the research study than what was being revealed. 

Near the beginning I realized they were part of a research experiment and all was confirmed when the one foster dad talks about the moment when he walked in on the group toasting with Champagne. Hey assumed at the time that they were toasting as a result of getting away with something, but to me it was obvious... they were celebrating their success of their experiment. 

I actually lean more towards them being clones rather than twins. There just was too much prestige associated with all that was involved with the research study if it was just merely a twin separation study. And apparently according to the bio mom it was a prom night one night stand. In which case she would have to know who the father was... why wouldn't the trio want to seek out their bio dad for a hell of it?  Because it's a bullshit story.  I'm curious who the dad was, since I believe that he's a chosen entity rather than a random one.. They clearly came from the mom. She looks like she could be the 4th twin for fuck sake. 

&#x200B;

Oh yeah and that research assistant was a shady lady who was playing cover for the experiment. She's obviously not just a lab assistant and she knows a lot more than what she was revealing. 

I'm curious what indeed happened to the brother who allegedly offed himself. There's all kinds of ways the psyche of humans can be meddled with and I wouldn't be surprised if the brothers falling apart was part of the experiment as well. 

But it's a trippy story indeed, but there's definitely much more too the study.  I liked Three Identical Strangers because the story & acting where compelling. I think [this](https://thefilmguys.blog/reviews/augusts-reviews/three-identical-strangers-2018/) covers it best. 1. Like the former assistant (I think she was) stated, back then all kinds of testing wasn't heavily looked at as far as human ethics, etc. Animal testing (not just lab rats) was still heavy back then, etc. A lot has changed since then. 
2. Breaking down DNA, studying gene factors, gene expression didn't really start occurring until the last two decades. The tests in the film were started in what? the 60s?
3. She was probably the only pragmatic person in the dramatized documentary.
4. Having studied Childhood Education as well as taken a good handful of psychology classes, it was interesting. But I felt I would have enjoyed it more if it was a straight up clinical psychology/science documentary.
5. Not really because of #4
6. At this point due to DNA sequencing, etc. in MY opinion, I feel like those ""studies"" whatever they were are too archaic at this point. The only reason they probably weren't released was due to legal issues and what not. They probably could have found out and revealed why... but I guess that's now going to be left for the NOW film adaptation. Interesting movie. Loved every minute of it.  I just saw this movie. The story is compelling, and it raises a lot of questions about ethics and how much they should be compromised in the name of science. Clearly, the researchers crossed a line here.

As for criticisms, this movie dragged on too long. Too much of the archival footage was repeated throughout, and the backstories should have been provided entirely at the beginning of the film. I found myself getting into the story and wanting to find out what happened next, only to have the movie take me back to their childhood--even in the last 20 minutes or so, they were still covering backstory. By the end of the movie, I was more interested in the present day, or to hear more from other twins also involved in this study. Regarding question 2, I agree with your comment. I commissioned a research scientists who specializes in twin studies to write about the movie and how the story presented fits into the current research. [http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/3141/twins-reared-apart-from-birth-beyond-the-secret-study](http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/3141/twins-reared-apart-from-birth-beyond-the-secret-study) Wow.  I went into this movie knowing  nothing except it was about triplete re-uniting.  I didn't even know it was a documentary and was expecting a fictional suspense film.  This led me to assume it was a fictional suspense mockumentary as I was watching.  What a mind fuck.  

Great film.  Certainly dramatic.  Perhaps a bit overwrought at times.  Quite an interesting story and cast of characters. 

Still processing but you ask some interesting questions I'll consider.  [deleted] Has anyone heard more details about the NYC apartment days up through the restaurant? I know the documentary is not about the guys personal lives so much as the adoption experiment, but I have heard there was a lot of drug use - could add to depression etc.  /u/inmyelement what exactly were your intentions reading this thread? You've been harassing me, clearly about my political stance, in response to a comment that was clearly about this movie here and, while you could misread my comment, it had no political content [deleted] Just got back from this and really can't get it off my mind. All conspiracies are true in Trump's America, OMG.

But seriously.....a lot of what I think is ham-fistedness that I find to be the hallmark of English TV was very present here, but really the film was just a vehicle for this totally unbelievable and unfortunately true story.

Like watching a Mengele experiment. I can't believe this. 

Scientific Stockholm Syndrome As someone who grew up in a family that had very bad communication and emotional intelligence, this hit me hard. Many times in my life, just being around emotionally open parents, my depression significantly decreased because you feel like you have a safety net that understands you. When the father said they never talked about their problems and smiled, I wanted to smack him. Kids need to feel they can talk about anything with their parents, and feel loved or they will go through severe mental trauma. DEVILS ADVOCATE. Good day. Wow. What a documentary. Shocking. But I’d like to be logical for a minute. Why are people comparing this to Nazi practices?? If that was the case, all children of Jewish origin would be exterminated or starved, abused, deprived of basic needs. Let’s not forget these kids were given loving homes instead. Yes, their parents might not have been perfect, but neither are parents of any biological children born into any family. They did not put them in a cage to study them, they did not sell them into sex slavery, they did not expose them to any harmful experimental medication, they did not place them with alcoholic or abusive parents. Which is a better chance at survival than many people born into biological families get. Let’s not forget, the boys were abandoned by their alcoholic mother. Do you think they would have had a better chance growing up all together with an alcoholic single mother? All they did was give them nice families and a good chance at life and occasionally visited the home to observe them and document things. I do not find it to be comparable to any evil behaviors Nazis practiced against Jewish people. So let’s not throw big words around. There are millions of children around the world who live in complete poverty, with no opportunities, safety or healthcare, who would dream of having either of the three parent sets and the life they provided for the boys. I don’t believe separating them is what caused Eddy’s suicide. We would have to know his whole life history, medical/treatment history, drug/alcohol use history to understand the full picture. It definitely wasn’t his parents fault. And yes, genetics play a huge role when it comes to mental health/addiction. There are endless cases of kids who had a great life and were very nurtured and still ended up addicts and dying as a result. 
Also, please remember, when this study was created, we lived in a different world. Completely different world. We smoked in every building, including airplanes, women had no rights, racism/sexism/bigotry was everywhere, the definition of “ethical” was worlds away from where we are now. Compared to all the massive issues with ethics they had back then, I’m sure giving children a loving home and observing them over the years was not anything people found ethically wrong. I’m sure they wanted to achieve what every study of humans does and help future generations understand the way humans are built and whether your environment can override your genetics. In my personal opinion, the reason the study was not published is to prevent negatively affecting all participants involved in the study. Clearly the results would show that genetics win over nurture. I think that would be a very tough pill to swallow for sensitive people and discourage many from adopting, ultimately depriving many orphans of a chance at family like the boys were given. Many with history of mental health or addiction problems will simply be left without a chance at adoption. And that is a true lack of nurture. If you feel bad for triplets who were raised with loving families, relatives, Holidays, had a chance of getting educated, imagine all the orphans, who live their life in constant struggle, bouncing from foster to foster, if they are lucky. Also, orphans have the highest rate of being sexually abused as children. They are the ones you should feel bad for. That is a much worse outcome than boys with three loving families, who were given the best chance at life they could get. So, let look at a bigger picture, instead of a puzzle piece. Maybe some things are better left unsaid. Maybe publishing that study now would do more damage than good. Because if the results were that nurture can overwrite nature, the study would be published and everyone would ride off into the sunset. Yeah, it seemed really unfair the way the movie made him look, but I'm glad most people see it's not his fault. Which, maybe the movie does a good job at letting us see that Eddy's dad didn't really do anything wrong, but that he's been blamed in a way by the experiment. I just know I left the theater feeling like he was portrayed unfairly.  Well said. I felt for Eddy's father, too. \*walks by table\* ""my picassos""  To me, she seemed like a sociopath. I thought she came across as a cold super-villain type, myself.  Did you see how well connected she was - all of those pics with politicians.  I think that was a not-so-subtle reminder that a lot of the people behind the study had some pretty important people on their side.   I had the same thought about her AND the guy assistant. Both didn't seem to see anything wrong with it. The guy said looking back on it that it probably wasn't ethical, but his other comments didn't make me believe that he meant that. I took it as both research assistants were very old and just awkward being on camera. It always makes people look bad when they laugh when posed a serious question.  I don't think she's all there anymore.  About the murder, there is this from the director's AMA:

We acknowledged this in the film (he is confronted about it by someone on the Donahue show) but didn't have time to go into it in detail. For the record, he wasn't accused of murder - someone else committed the crime, he never met the victim.

(to which someone responded) [ThatguyIncognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatguyIncognito):

That continues to downplay his role. He was the driver, knowing that his accomplice said ahead of time that if she resisted he would kill her. He continued to participate after the killer left the house covered in blood. He continued to participate when they went together to sell the ring cut from her hand. He never met her? so the fuck what? You've paid the guy and you've made him a sympathetic hero. Your continuing to downplay his admitted complicity is disturbing and ethically questionable. Isn't it kind of a dirty little secret that some adopted people have mental issues? Being separated from their moms is part of it but perhaps the moms had mental issues that made them not responsible of taking care of their kids in the first place which could be hereditary. 

 > I agree that there wasn't enough on the older adopted sisters. Can you imagine finding or orchestrating families with different incomes, all having an older adopted sister of the same age, and all from the same agency?

It makes you wonder how far in advanced was this whole study planned and how long it was orchestrated. I mean, did they let a bunch of families adopt girls at a certain age, wait a few years and choose three families with ranging incomes and lifestyles and hope they all want a new child? As immoral as it is, it impressive they were able to orchestrate all of that. 

> Also I'm wondering if the study was picking birth parents with mental health issues or if the two twin sets is just a coincidence.

They mentioned in the documentary that the experiment had nothing to do with mental health. We can't trust everything the researchers say, but I think I do believe that. The nature/nurture thing seemed to have more relevance, and I'm not sure how much people paid attention to mental health back then anyway. I do think it's just a coincidence. I'm struggling to find a way to say this without generalizing, but I feel like mental illness is possibly fairly common in parent's who give up kids for adoption. I'm no expert in the subject, and am not accusing anyone of anything, but that kind of makes sense to me. I could be wrong though.  What murder are you talking about? Oh no.  This screamed conspiracy to me.  

Also...the documents were “sealed” but by who?  What did Yale have to say about this?  It’s just a school library not the Pentagon I'm just going to put this out there...  This film is constructed so tightly that there doesn't seem to be a single unnecessary scene.  So why do they spend time showing the Research Assistant's photos with all these powerful politicians?  More to the point, how has this one random woman been able to meet all of these powerful people? 2.  I'm just going to put this out there...

More to the point, how has this one random woman been able to meet all of these powerful people? -2- Its probable that they didn't get full ethical approval for all the things they actually did in the study, therefore they can't publish without the threat (to the board members) of being sued.  The 2066 date puts anyone who might potentially be able to show harm (and the board members involved) well out of reach.

-6- Twin studies with adoption are still the gold standard of control for heritability/environemental effect studies.  DNA testing wouldn't really have added anything to the study.  They know the DNA is the same.  They don't care what that DNA IS.

The interesting thing about this study, is something that will never be repeated... the single blinding design (of the twins.) I think the researches who conducted the experiment had some sort of deal with that adoption agency. I don't think the hospitals were involved at all, at least not knowingly. 

We don't find out exactly what they're toasting mainly because no one really knows. We can pretty much assume it's a ""well that was a close one"" kind of toast. I also read that the brother's didn't want the filmmakers to find their birth-dad.  came here surprised to see the lack of discussion. limited release maybe? My mouth dropped when the said the siblings were a factor in where they were placed. Such an insidious crazy story Just to chime in on that. Isn't one of the reasons we find this type of study unethical is that other studies have shown the detrimental effects of something like this?  the stanford prison experiment is nothing compared to this and is nothing like this. the more accurate context is that the prevailing ideas of child psychology/sociology at the time were fucking batshit retarded. like straight up touch and affection are ***bad*** for kids. It seems that nature gives you traits, but nurture is about dealing with life's everyday problems and what not They definitely alluded to growing apart and having different lives but didn't explain it much. Examining the differences would've been interesting. That's probably what the research was looking into. It was just opening a can of worms leaving a lot more questions than answers. It just seemed to me that they were not emotionally level enough to be open about it. > I think the movie concluded fairly resolutely that nurture is more important than nature.

Did it? I thought they just wanted to end on a positive note even if it meant throwing one of the adopted parents under the bus because the kid committed suicide.  Not having a narrator was probably the only way to make this movie.  I enjoyed it, but i was fuming over everything that was left unsaid and it’s allowed me to forgive the omissions as a necessary stylistic choice.

I’m not as forgiving as you are towards some of these people.

1. Neubauer escaped Nazi Europe and was funded by the Jewish board.  I don’t believe he could fail to realize the parallels between his work and the Nazis, especially considering he lived into the 2000s and the full extent of atrocities had long since been unveiled.  What he did was horrible and he had plenty of time to atone but chose not to.

2. I was kind of upset by this point as well.  Why go so nebulous with the message when there are answers? The hereditary nature of many mental health issues (including depression, schizophrenia, and alcoholism mentioned in the film) is well documented.  I might have been more upset by this because I felt it allowed audience members to walk out of the theater thinking there was some merit to study when research has been able to provide some answers without uh, being evil.

3. It wasn’t all “good science” in the 60s, and the fact that people felt emboldened to do bad things in the name of science is why we have modern guidelines.  There are researchers in those experiments who show remorse and growth, and then there is our female research assistant in the film, who seemed more regretful that the study wasn’t completed.  Watching her was chilling.  

Anyways, I don’t want to talk myself out of liking this film. 👍👍 [deleted] There was no opportunity to present the other side, because the other side will not respond. Only two people who seemed to have minimal knowledge were willing to take any ownership. 
 I too felt it was really one sided. Also to tie it to the Holocaust was huge stretch. Anyone who's read anything about psychology knows that a lot of stuff that was studied before the 1970s was similar to this. Not saying it wasn't unethical, it was but its not as if Nazi experiments were used as a framework for this. 
 It's funny how we see their similarities so important at the beginning of the movie, but we see them as more superficial towards the end. The one brother even says something along the lines of , ""we just wanted to be like each other."" I'm sure that any three of us on this thread could find five or six specific things that we all have in common that would seem crazy if you mentioned we were related and separated at birth.  Yes, the United States has participated in several horrific studies in the pursuit of science in the not so distant past. This article came out recently about the damage to public trust on the anniversary of the [Tuskegee experiments] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolefisher/2018/07/31/less-than-50-years-after-tuskegee-can-trust-in-our-health-system-be-restored/). I wouldn’t read unless you are prepared to be upset.  I wouldn’t be surprised if more recent or current unethical experimentation were to be uncovered. I wondered about that too, but I guess gap years are pretty common. I didn't go to uni until I was 21. They had summer birthdays, usually the cut off date for starting kindergarten is August 1. So, if you were born in July, you ""should"" start school just after turning 5. However, parents of some summer birthday children hold them a year, so they start just after turning 6. This is my guess for the discrepancy; and it was Eddie who was a freshman at 18 but didn't come back for sophomore year, Bobby was an incoming freshman at 19, and I think that unfortunately also fits with research that it's better to start school later rather than earlier. TOTALLY agree with number one. Why work so hard for this, and publish. That's what really got me.  [deleted] No, it was Bobby who was involved in a murder. Wild theory, fun to read. Where did you see a picture of the mother? lol Your blog sucks. You weigh all 10 of your scoring categories equally. Have you found anything on his suicide? I’m harassing you? You made a political comment so I responded to you.  I agree - there were so many details left unexplored. What ever happened to the birth father? [Did the sisters ever find out they had been used? Are the remaining triplets still in contact with them?](#spoiler) I felt the whole sister storyline was overlooked. That was the part of the movie that really got my attention. [That was where it went from separating siblings at birth to orchestrating their entire lives by choosing their families.](#spoiler) I understand that they may not have been able to contact all of the necessary people, but they should've at least added in the printed text towards the end that they tried to find out (albeit potentially in vain). The lack of coverage on these topics made the repetition of the same footage (particularly the interview where they talk about smoking the same cigarettes) that much more tedious.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm referring to the triplets' adopted sisters, not the twin sisters interviewed separately [deleted] how the heck did you drag Trump in this? And then you dragged America in this as well? You know the history of the rest of the world, right? at least she was willing to talk. from wardle (director) on huffpost:

> Furthermore, throughout the process, Wardle said, he located a few folks with ties to the study who initially agreed to talk. But when his team contacted these individuals a second time, they would “never, ever respond again,” as if they’d been silenced.

came across this [change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/the-jewish-release-the-louise-wise-adoption-agency-secret-study-of-identical-twins-separated-at-birth-0a4a3225-11c1-4ab8-bfec-5c56656aa1a3) to release the files Let me tell you, anyone who has a bunch of pics in their house of celebs they've met like trophies is usually fucking crazy This is the mindset of an establishment administrator.

Cold, macro perspective with zero care for individuals.

Sad! I think to him, he meant *technically* ethical. Not like a personal moral ethical thing. At least that's my feel from him. Just by his body language and the way he was sitting told me he didn't care Yeah, especially with the guy, his laughs didn't seem like he thought that these people's lives that he had a part in ""ruining"" were a joke. It seems like he was more trying to casually talk about something difficult on camera, a whole lot of years later. People laugh for lots of reasons. And maybe they did express some kind of guilt that we didn't necessarily see due to editing.  To be fair she was just a research assistant. And I don't think she stayed in the field for much longer. Its not like she designed the study or was really invested in it.  There is no solid empirical data to support the idea that people adopted as infants have any greater prevalence of mental health issues than non-adopted people.  I read the book by the two women mentioned in the movie before seeing this movie yesterday.  (massive spoiler alert)  their book focused a lot on mental health issues of both of them,  and their mother and some findings they had that the experiment was all about separating identical twins from mothers with mental health issues to see what would happen with the kids.  Ie was it nature or nurture.  It was on a TV interview. They mentioned one of them was accused and they were covering for a friend or something  [removed] I'm just going to put this out there...  This film is constructed so tightly that there doesn't seem to be a single unnecessary scene.  So why do they spend time showing the Research Assistant's photos with all these powerful politicians?  More to the point, how has this one random woman been able to meet all of these powerful people? The women's book has a lot more info about the documents.  (the twin women shown in the movie.  I think the book is also called identical strangers)  Its crazy how its legal to keep the documents locked up like that My guess is the filmmaker’s intent was to let you get to know the figure a bit, so you can judge her credibility and be more attached to her. I agree, I think it fell a little flat.  Yeah, I can't remember her name, but if anyone does, please let me know. I feel like she's got to be someone powerful. Thank you a million times for using ""inheritability/environmental"" instead of the godawful ""N vs. N""  Yeah, I totally agree that it's unethical, but I genuinely believe that they didn't think there was anything unethical about it. And it IS a study that a lot could be learned from. I don't know any other way to do this study more ethically.  lolwut. what a meaningless statement. I thought the message was something along the lines of, ""nature loads the gun, nurture pulls the trigger."" But also, I think the film was supposed to be inconclusive because we don't know anything about the study. 

I didn't think the father was necessarily painted as responsible for his son's suicide. A factor, maybe, but it's never just one thing. I felt for him. I thought it was implied he didn't have a good relationship with his other child/children either. I found the constant smile heart-wrenching. There was so much pain there.  You’re right, I think, about trying to end on a positive note. I guess the director wanted to try to reach some kind of conclusion. Still, the parent who came off the best was the one who died early. He was the poorest, but loving. His son seemed the happiest, and the other two brothers gravitated to that dad. When that father died, chaos began happening to the triplets. I think the director was contrasting the positive nurturing of the poor parent, vs the disciplinarian nurturing of the teacher. Genetically, all three brothers should be pre-disposed to the same outcomes. But the one who had the engaged, loving father came out the happiest.  I think it was inconclusive, but shows that nature and nurture are both important, but maybe nurture is more. Still, it's upsetting that the disciplinary dad was thrown under the bus, as you say. The director said it wasn't his intention to paint the dad as a ""bad guy"", but I know I'm not alone in seeing this movie showing him in a very bad light. Great points. I think it’s clear everyone behind the experiment (Neubaurer, the board, the assistants) realized how fucked up it all was towards the end. It’s why the project was stopped, and they tried to bury it. They very well could have been afraid of getting sued. Hence, the champagne when they thought the parents were placated.

I do think the project started with good intentions, but as it went on they began to realize what a horrible mistake they had made. Uh, okay. Don't think I've ever heard anyone defend Nazi testing before.  Thank you for answering my four year old post.  :) He was the only one of the triplets, whose story was being told.  The filmmaker wasn't telling the story of everyone involved in the study.

  
I'm not doubting you, but if you have information to share, you could share it without the passive-aggression. We get to see her yearbook at one point.  Here it is : https://i.imgur.com/Q4Xg0iF.jpg I'm not even sure how you can score ""casting"" in a documentary I did not make a political comment. Why don't you read it again. You also responded rather rudely, even if i had I agree with your review! IMO, the film could have been shorter, better edited, and could have included a lot more information. I felt it was a collection of a lot of pictures that they kept repeating. Like you said, I could have read about this online.  The sisters stated in the television interview clips that they were part of a study, so they already knew. The fact that the triplets did not discuss the study once they gained access may indicate that they were not allowed to discuss it -- that they signed an agreement that they would not before reading it. I agree somewhat. The story all over was great, but the continuous repetition of the same old video clips and photos was not helpful. I'm not sure what could be done differently, but I think there was room for improvement. No, what is it Yeah, he definitely used “ethical” in terms of APA research ethics. I think they're talking more about people who are born to people with mental health issues having a higher chance of having mental health issues. Like if you adopt a kid who's biologic parent's have issues, you could find those same issues in your kid. That seems crazy specific. How many twins/tripplets are there, how many of them have parents with mental illness, and how many of those parents decide to give up their kids? Seems like it would be incredibly hard to get a decent sample size  Oh yeah completely forgot about that scene. Strange they didn’t mention it anymore.  I'm just going to put this out there...  This film is constructed so tightly that there doesn't seem to be a single unnecessary scene.  So why do they spend time showing the Research Assistant's photos with all these powerful politicians?  More to the point, how has this one random woman been able to meet all of these powerful people? [deleted] The worst part was that it was done by jewish people who escaped the holocaust I can't imagine being in a room with a kid knowing he has other identical brothers and him not knowing. My soul would not let me be silent Ha! I just watched it today so I'm making the rounds of posts from back when it was new :) at least one other twin in the study committed suicide. That's really only interesting if we know how many people were in the study which we don't, but we're lead several times to believe it was a small enough number to make two a statistical anomaly.

At least once in the film  it was suggested that they were studying the children of people with mental illness and how being brought up in different environments can affect how they inherit those illnesses. If that's truly the case (I don't know that it is) then the research could be incredibly valuable. However I doubt it was completed to the degree in which this would be the case. 

Also want to politely suggest that maybe your over estimating how famous the triplets got.  And then proceed to give it a 9/10. Are you talking about the twin sisters, or the the sisters of the triplets? I'm talking about the triplets' adopted sisters. Sorry, looking back I wasn't very clear Late to the party but thought I'd reply to you. I think the repetition of the video clips helped with context.
For example, at the beginning when they are all reunited and find out about have adopted sisters all the same age, it felt like a ""heh. That's cute"" moment but later on when discovering about how they planned it out and sent them out to specific families with an already adopted child, it gives a ""o shit, wtf, etc."" Type of reaction. At least that's how I reacted/felt people suck all over the world...  I actually don't think there's a lot of evidence for that, necessarily.  I doubt that. She's an old, wealthy (she points out her Picasso's) author/researcher living in New York. Over time you attend enough events that you get pictures with high profile people. Politicians and actors will take pictures with anyone who will get near them. It doesn't have to be a conspiracy for her to have shaken hands with a few important people.  I’m dying to know where her money came from and if she received special treatment by the esteemed psychiatrist for her silence (ie a well paying social work position in his country of residence after fleeing the natzi invasion- etc) It's lazy and trite. Almost as much as use of ""af."" Huh? no, you would probably be silent. you don't understand how foundational and invisible the ultimate ideas are that shape your reactions and beliefs about things. you likely would've been just like the folks shown and talked about at the time - you would've simply believed that separating twins was not that consequential/damaging because you're very impressive and accomplished supervisor would thoroughly convince you of that and that was the prevailing thought in psychology at the time. this is roughly the same time as the dominant notion that touch/affection was ***bad*** for children in many cases, and, for example, a crying child should be ignored and left alone. Oh I see what you are saying. Yup I meant the twins my bad 😀 I wish people didn't suck quite as much as they do here in the USA What do you mean I'm no expert in the subject, but I feel like I've heard the phrase ""mental illness runs in the family"" before. And after a quick google search, I think depression, Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are biological. Probably more. I could be wrong, but if anyone does know a lot about mental health and it's origins, I would love to know for sure. How exactly did she become so wealthy? Here's what I think they were insinuating (that the other guy who responded to me was a bit too daft to understand): it's not necessarily about her having money.  Rather, these politicians accepted campaign donations from people involved in the twin study, which -- if you've ever worked with organizations like that -- allow you to have meet-and-greets with said politicians.  Those are the same people who don't want the records unsealed, because then it comes out that they accepts donations from a pretty nefarious organization. [deleted] The thief believes everyone is a thief You probably don’t know that much about what’s happening elsewhere in the world  Who knows. Probably partly through writing/research, or inheritance from a dead husband since she's old as fucking dirt and comes from a foreign country. We don't know anything about who she is, what she does, or where she comes from. Some people just have money. Old people who own property in a major city are certainly more likely to have lots of money compared to the average population.

39,"Love how this avoided so many obvious subplots and tropes - Ruben never has a relapse, he doesn't have a romance with his hot ASL teacher, his RV doesn't get robbed etc The sound mixing/editing deserves SO much attention this upcoming Oscar season holy shit. The shot of Ruben drumming on the metal slide while the little boy put his ear to it was fucking beautiful. I’m tearing up thinking about it. THAT LAST SCENE. That ending was so well done.  They didn’t harp on the break-up or basically that his life is now in shambles and he is homeless, yet it had such an impact in those final moments.  He got the implants to get back to his old life, thus destroying his new life, only to find his old life has moved on without him, and is left with essentially little to nothing. One thing I love about this movie is the lack of extreme plot twist. I’ve become so accustomed to thinking, “alright what shit is gonna happen next...” and it turns out? Nothing. And I really loved that. The center wasn’t fishy or suspicious, Lou never do anything out of line, and Ruben although stressed never had a crazy tantrum destroying anything outside of the trailer scene. 

The Sound of Metal is a great title as well. I just realized the title refers to both the music Ruben played and the sound his new implants gave him. The scene where Ruben returns after the implants and Joe has to tell him he can't stay was amazingly well done. The disappointment Joe feels, Ruben not really getting it... Just great acting. Just when you’re blown away by these performances, remember that both Cooke and Ahmed are British! Incredible accent work. Beautiful film. I don’t have so much an analysis but just wanted to share personally how much this movie struck a chord with me.

I played in a touring band and am into the same bands as Ruben (if his shirts are any indication) so that’s what initially compelled me to give it a watch, but was not at all expecting how much I would identify with his story.

I am an addict who was in a long term relationship with a non-addict. I had an intervention via a relative and was essentially forced into rehab despite my wishes. My partner promised she would wait. That scene of Lou and Ruben standing at the cab broke me- because essentially same conversation happened to me.

After arriving at the rehab, fighting it, a couple of months go by and I eventually began to find my place & form deep bonds with the people in my facility. I was offered a job there to work with others dealing with their addiction. 

However, my primary goal was to get back into my relationship, get back to my band. “Save my life”

So against the advice of everyone in my program, I left. 

I returned and tried to revive my relationship, since I was now “fixed” . But we were on two totally separate life trajectories at that point. That open arm embrace upon my return that I had been fantasizing about was instead stifled, awkward. We just didn’t jive anymore. Our breakup looked the same too, through tears and solemn acceptance.

My sobriety ultimately failed- and I can’t help but wonder if it’s in part because I prioritized the wrong things at the time.

So yeah, wonderful movie. Makes me really love and appreciate the power of film. Feels weird getting so personal on this sub, but if you read this, thanks. The scene where Joe is telling Ruben he can’t stay with the group anymore; specifically when Ruben is anxiously explaining why he needs money, and Joe tells him he is acting like an addict was incredibly well done by both actors. The mix of disappointment/sadness but softness from Paul Raci, and the frustration and inner turmoil from Riz is done perfectly. A scene that will stick with me for a while. Is that really what it sounds like for people with implants? I naively assumed it would be like audio feed of normal sound. Not the crackling static. Genuinely laughed out loud when Ruben was drawing the naked lady for Jenn.  


""I don't like it completely shaved, I like a little hair on it.""  


\*fist bump\*  


Amazing film, very powerful! Brilliant movie. Amazing performance. A lot of people think Oldman will win his second this year but I'm really rooting for Ahmed to win his first. Anyone else notice how when Ruben starts working on the roof and Joe says not to, it’s because “it doesn’t need fixing” just like his deafness doesn’t need fixing? Thought it was a cool little detail Just watched it. My cousin's wife, who recommended it,  has cochlear implants.  She can't really understand music thru the implants, either.

I don't think this movie is really about just deafness specifically.  It's about loss.  Ruben spends the whole movie trying to get his old life back. The airstream, the gig life, the metal, the girl.  And he can't, because none of it is the same after. He rejected the deaf commune because it required him to cut ties with the hearing world, and everyone in it. He wants his old life back, that's the goal.

In the end, he has that moment of acceptance. Of course he's not throwing away the implant forever, he's just cutting off the sounds when it gets overwhelming. He gets his moment of stillness, when he accepts that everything has changed and he can finally move forward. He has nothing, but he's finally free. [deleted] The scene where Ruben is listening to Lou and her dad's song and the sound fades into what he's actually hearing... Amazing. This is one of those movies that really scares me and it's heartbreaking. 

It really was a rollercoaster of emotions. 

I found it funny that Matthew Amalric is in this movie when he had another which evoked similar feelings, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Movies were the main character goes through a medical ordeal in this way always unsettle me.

It definitely is Top 5 for me this year. Am I the only one who kept on lowering their volume as the movie progressed? Lost of hearing is one of the most frightening that could happen to someone. I guess people choose to view this film differently. There are some that choose to interpret the moments more reassuringly as acceptance. I thought the ending was incredibly sad. Absolute silence being better than the ringing noise that he spent 40-60 grand on is an incredibly sad position to be in, and the film made me realize how devastating it would be to never be able to hear for the rest of your life. Man... I cried for 10 minutes after that last scene cut to black. One of the most beautiful and powerful closing shots I’ve experienced in a long time. This film was truly an astounding accomplishment. Cinema at its absolute purest. Loved it. Movies about drummers seem to stick... Whiplash and now Sound of Metal. This movie broke me down. The break up/acceptance scene at the end finally did me in. Beautiful film. And Riz Ahmed deserves an Oscar nomination. Easily best movie of the year. It better win best sound editing and mixing at the Oscars this year. Can't think of better use of sound in a movie. “It’s ok, Lou”

Good fucking lord I knew that was coming but that shit broke me in half. What a beautiful movie. 

Life ain’t easy Okay, I get that movies studios do remakes/reboots/sequels/IP movies to make money, but this film is a textbook example of what major movie studios should be filming.

Original fucking ideas.

This film is an extreme gut punch, if you choose to look at it that way. I've been a drummer my whole life and this movie, while great, was also big time nightmare fuel. Couldn't be happier that my drum teacher was always constantly pounding the need for hearing protection into my head; You can't catch me at a gig without in-ears with sound canceling / a show without sonic earplugs. Protect your hearing people, once its gone its gone! I've been looking forward to watching this one for quite a bit and I'm glad to say it was unsurprisingly good. It's filled with impeccable sound design and a moving performance from Riz Ahmed (which is one of my favorites of this entire year). This was just really well made, and absolutely devastating. 



P.S I have never been more distracted by a pair of eyebrows through out a movie. I love how Ruben’s entire story arc can be summed up with three different interpretations of the title:

1. The sound of metal, the music genre 
2. The sound of the metal slide
3. The sound of the metal implants (metallic sound)

Such a beautiful, sad, and horrifying story. Loved it. As far as I’m concerned, this is the best film of 2020 thus far. My senses are sloshed, and I mean that in the most overwhelmingly endearing way possible.

Riz Ahmed’s performance is powerful, and Cooke’s supporting role carries with it a necessary weight to bolster the core narrative and character of Ahmed.

And the ending? One of the best endings I’ve seen in a long time. Riz should get an Oscar nom. So I’m a little late here, but as a implantee, I thought I would offer my 2 cents to the movie and I can only compare it to my journey.

First off, the first act of him losing his hearing... I lost mine slowly, so I can’t imagine how frustrating it would be to lose it so quickly.   The having to have you SO talk on the phone was very realistic.   

I’m deaf, not Deaf (there’s a difference), so I never am going to be part of the Deaf community, so the second act when he is at the rehab center and deaf school were not something I connected with.

The surgery/activation.   I understand it’s a movie and you have to condense some things.   Getting activated doesn’t just make everything better, you have to work on it.   There’s hearing therapy involved and you have to train your brain to deal with the new sounds.   The metallic hearing he heard and the scenes at the party and walking down the street were realistic.   Getting implants doesn’t make the world loud, it makes it busy.  However, your brain adapts... he could easily go back to playing drums and living his previous life.

Living in the Deaf community vs the rest of the world:  For Ruben, being accepted into the Deaf community offered him stability and a community vs the nomadic life he was living.   It ends with realizing Lou was better off without him, leaving him all alone.  But for most of us, the choice would be to obviously live in the rest of the world.   Would I leave my family, kids, friends and job just to join the Deaf community?  No, that would make no sense.   So for most of us, getting an implant let’s us function better in the world.  

The sound:  I found it pretty accurate, the muffling when he’s deaf and the busyness when he gets activated.   And I’ve been there when you take it off and the world goes silent, like the end of the film, and it’s a great relief.  But it’s even better when you turn it back on and talk to your loved ones. Paul Raci as Joe was a really great performance. Could really get a good feel of his emotions in every scene. Especially the final one between him and Riz Ahmed where he has to tell Ruben to leave the house.

The sound editing was very well done. It made things quite stressful and it hurt to be placed in Rubens world and feel his frustration. Really felt for him after the surgery didn’t end up working for him. Late response but I really enjoyed the movie. The ending scene in bed was very real. Trying to get back his old life but coming to the conclusion that it wasn’t going to work. Then telling her she saved his life. And that he’s thankful for her. One of the most real breakup scenes I’ve seen in media. This movie was humbling. Simple, straightforward, gripping and real.

I loved the juxtaposition of the ending. His life is seemingly at its worst, and it’s only then when he discovers a moment of stillness.

The final shot left me humbled. It left me emotional and inspired. It reminded me that I value the pursuit of mindfulness, even though day-to-day routines and habits ultimately end up distracting me a majority of the time.

It left me annoyed with myself that I haven’t taken enough time out of my life to be still.

Truly one of the most human movies I’ve seen Fantastic sound design throughout the film. The last couple of scenes with Ruben & Lou in bed, then Ruben on the bench were fantastic. Was really anxious leading up to Ruben leaving to see what had happened to Lou and was very happy to see her also happy, if not very different; probably how Ruben felt too.

What does everyone think ends up happening with Ruben? Does he go back to the community, continue with making music, or embrace an entirely different path?

Think my personal takeaway from this film is to try to have some quiet time to myself. I cram media consumption in damn near every second of my waking life. I need to sit down with a hot coffee and a doughnut and just exist for a while sometimes.

EDIT: Think my favourite scene was the final conversation between Ruben & Joe. Joe breaking emotionally after being such a rock for so long really got to me. It was like seeing a close friend who you've never seen cry, cry. Really great performance. Notice the disappointment at the quality of sound he finally experiences in the doc’s office. The whole time before that initial activation he’s thinking how the implants will be a return to normalcy, and the restrained response that revealed so much was just amazing from an acting perspective. I swear I could hear his thoughts. So well done Brilliant film about a topic I haven’t seen before. As someone with a disability, it meant a lot to me that the actors at the rehab were in the deaf community in real life too. 

I hope Riz Ahmed is recognized this award season. He’s a wonderfully natural actor. The ending is so bittersweet and it feels so authentic in how it handled the subject matter of life. 

At the end of it all, he has to come to terms with the fact that as much as he tried, the life that he once had was over. His hearing would never be the same and him and Lou are at separate paths in life. As he takes in Joe’s earlier advice to sit and take things in, he comes to also realize that life goes on; his old life may gone but as he takes some time to reflect, he finds some calmness and peace as he begins his next chapter in life. Did anyone realise when Ruben first got to the deaf community and sat there trying to figure out everyone’s hand gestures and signals? He was so confused, he doesn’t understand what’s going on and how to be deaf. Fast forward to when he’s in the party at Lou’s father’s place, he got his hearing back but he still didn’t understand, because of the language and the cochlear implants.

I just thought it’s devastating juxtaposition. He can’t wait to get his old life back yet it’s never the same, life passes. Saw this Thursday night and have been waiting ever since to talk about this great movie and Riz Ahmed's perfect performance.

I've always been a big fan of movie scores. But the absence of one here was amazing, to just be immersed in muffled sounds/silence and nature, was profoundly effective. Starting with that chilling first time his hearing went out when they were setting up the merch booth, Riz's acting and the sound design were so successful at bringing us into Ruben's world. His panic, the desperation to return to who he used to be. But also hope and calm, like that beautiful scene with the student on the playground slide.

Also, a shout out to Paul Raci (Joe, the leader of the deaf house/program) who was great too. That final talk between him and Ruben made me cry.  I don’t know if you guys noticed but during the ending credits you can hear childrens laughter in the background.. implying that Ruben eventually went back to helping out at the school and starting a new future.

Truly a beautiful film.

Each of them found a new normal. Very good film, one of the year’s best so far. It absolutely deserves the positive reviews and awards buzz it’s been getting. Riz Ahmed was great and the story was very moving, I wished Hollywood could do more movies like this. I was highly anticipating this movie because I am an audiologist. I had some issues with this movie, but overall really appreciated the light it sheds on my profession, the Deaf community, and the importance of the ability to communicate with others. All of the acting was amazing (obviously Riz Ahmed) including Lulu and Joe.

Sudden permanent hearing loss is rare, but terrifying. It usually occurs in just one ear, but in Ruben's case, can occur bilaterally. HOWEVER, an initial identification of sudden bilateral sensorineural hearing loss would NEVER stop with the audiologist, especially < 24 hours after occurrence. The audiologist would have referred to an otolaryngologist (audiologists are not MDs) where steroid injection in the ear has potential for hearing recovery, at least to some extent. In the movie, Ruben went from deafness to living at the Deaf community in what seemed like 3-4 days, when really 4-6 weeks of treatment would occur between those events. Also, Ruben's hearing loss was portrayed as possibly stemming from noise exposure. Yes, loud noise can damage hearing, but drumming with in-ear monitors would not cause a sudden hearing loss like Ruben had.

Next, the portrayal of cochlear implant had some good and bad aspects. The sound quality through a cochlear implant is drastically different from hearing through the typical acoustic pathways. I can't say if it was exactly what CIs sound like (it is actually different for every wearer due to differences in insertion depth/position), but it was mostly realistic, especially the incredible difficulty in background noise situations. HOWEVER, these expectations would always be explained to Ruben UPFRONT. He would not be going into the surgery with expectations of perfectly restored hearing unless there was a gross negligence of counseling on the audiologist and surgeon's part. What's also important to remember is that much of the initial distorted sound through CIs naturally resolves as the brain adapts to hearing sound in that manner over time.

In my opinion, these were two issues that were pretty crucial to the plot and somewhat removed me from the movie. I realize only someone with specific knowledge of that would be annoyed by it and without knowing that, the movie was truly fantastic. Acting, emotion, sound. I would recommend this movie to anyone to gain a better understanding of the Deaf world and a better appreciation for the abilities we take for granted.

Shameless ""plug"": Please wear hearing protection around loud noise. Fuck me. I hope Joe ends up letting him come back if he keeps the implant attachment off. This movie fucked me up After watching this movie I am fully on the Riz Ahmed train. Kindof doubted the constant praise he gets. But now I get it. I was left breathless when I watched this movie back in November. It's so real. As a Deaf and Hard of Hearing person, I never thought I would see the angst and confusion inexperienced as a child on screen. I loved it so much I did a review. I encourage you to watch it to get a perspective from a deaf and hard of hearing person: https://youtu.be/FIW8oVGAdwU I'm curious to know whether those implants actually sound that bad in real life. Does anyone know? Great acting throughout and gut punches in every act. I gasped when they >!turned on his implants and it sounded like someone speaking through a broken drive-through box. And I'm sure they would have explained that to him, but Rueben seemed so damn stubborn to get his hearing back!< Really beautifully observed - the most moving film I've seen this year (though to be fair, I haven't been moved by much thus far). 

The film never judges; Marder just stands back and lets you feel Ruben's journey. And that final scene was pitch-perfect. Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci were amazing in their roles - I never felt a trace of actorly technique. They did so much by showing emotional restraint.That said, the film didn't quite wreck/inspire me the way I thought it would. 

I think the biggest issue for me was the way it glossed over important developments (Ruben goes from signing the alphabet to becoming fluent within a few minutes of runtime) or avoided potentially gripping scenes (Ruben getting caught using Joe's computer). Also, Olivia Cooke was fantastic in her limited scenes and I could have used more of her character.

But overall, Marder is definitely one to watch and Ahmed and Raci absolutely deserve the awards buzz they're getting. As someone who used to be a blues rock drummer in my teens and 20s, the scene where he first starts silently panicking from a tinnitus episode legitimately made me feel like I was on the edge of a panic attack because it reminded me of my tinnitus episode when I was younger.  This movie is incredible and I hate that it took me this long to see it. I lost all hearing over a year and a half when I was 16. Of course this move spoke to me. His experience was pretty accurate, I’d say. Expect his loss seemed to progress very rapidly, and they never explained the cause of the hearing loss. Not even my hearing loss was that rapid. If it was due to exposure to loud music, it wouldn’t be that rapid and it probably wouldn’t have continued to decline rapidly once he stopped playing in the band. 


A lot of the movie was true to the real world deaf community, a lot of them do view deafness as something that doesn’t need to be fixed and there are parts of the community who are very against cochlear implants, but most won’t shun people who do get cochlear implants. 


I’m not a candidate for cochlear because the auditory nerves between my cochlea and my brain are destroyed, so stimulating the cochlea wouldn’t work. Instead, I am a candidate for Auditory Brainstem Implants, which are similar to cochlear, only about twice as expensive, the surgery is much more dangerous, and the sound quality sucks much more than cochlear. Even if it’s nothing like the hearing I had before, I’d jumó on the opportunity to get an ABI immediately if presented with one. I don’t get the part of the community that’s so against fixing deafness. Yes, you can be proud to be deaf and embrace it, but I think we can all agree it’s a pain in the ass when interacting with the hearing world, and I’d just much rather have whatever tiny little sense of hearing an ABI would give me than stay completely shut out of the hearing world forever. I was very taken back by this movie. I thought it would be good but I didn't expect it to go the direction it went. So much great storytelling in times when dialogue isn't necessary. Even before the hearing loss when we see how he takes careful care of his sound equipment and how much he loves Lou. 

I wasn't sure, at first, how him being an addict tied in to the movie. At first you think that the idea of him being sober the same amount of time he's been with Lou would mean that she saved him, which is true. But the main conflict within him seemed to be how ""addicted"" he was to their life before he lost his hearing. His singular focus is her and, in turn, the dynamic that kept them together being singer and drummer. As Joe predicted that focus got in the way of his acceptance of how his life would have to be now. Him sneaking e-mails to her and checking up on her tour seems harmless, but even when he's doing well at the retreat he still has the goal of getting his hearing back. And it's not because she might leave him, it's because he sees his ability to hear as necessary to keep the life they once had. 

It becomes clear towards the end that she never considered leaving and that him being her drummer wasn't what was keeping them together, but he was missing the forest for the trees. Only seeing what was directly in front of him. And that makes it all the more tragic when he gets the procedure and not only is he shunned from his co op, but he realizes he'll never truly have his hearing back or his ability to perform like he did.

There weren't many main or supporting performances, but the ones there were were just incredible. The scene where Joe had to kick Ruben out of the house for getting the operation and therefore implying there was something wrong with being deaf killed me. Props to Olivia Cooke too, who tends to play more fragile characters but is so strong and steadfast in this movie. 

Solid 8/10 with possibly one of the more beautiful endings this year. Riz absolutely carries this movie and he's looking effortless doing it.

/r/reviewsbyboner Riz did an amazing job. You can see how desperate Ruben is throughout the film. And how he struggled to get his life back. And the most touching scene, the final scene, he finally accept the fact that he just can't go back to normal. It's heartbreaking. The final scene was just amazing as was the whole film. Riz deserves the Oscar nomination! Just wanna quickly praise Olivia Cooke here as I thought she was phenomenal and went toe-to-toe with Riz in all of their scenes. She’s come a long way since Bates Motel I've never seen Riz Ahmed in anything before, probably because I don't watch that much British stuff. Man, he nailed it. 

I guess I didn't know what type of metal band to expect going in, but if I had to hazard a guess, it definitely wouldn't have been drone metal. Points for introducing that genre to the people who vote on Oscars, I'm sure the one Sunn O))) fan in the academy was digging it. 

I watched this without subtitles. I'm not sure how much I missed but surprisingly you can get a really good viewing experience without them. 

I also love how the movie doesn't clearly take Joe's side and end with Ruben going back and admitting he was wrong. I imagine it would ruffle a few feathers among people who actually got cochlear implants if they did. They show that the implants aren't a perfect substitute for functional ears, as a perfect substitute does not exist. This movie isn't trying to argue that deafness isn't a problem that needs to be fixed, it's content to introduce that debate and show the community responses to it. And I think that's cool. It's easy to get up on a soap box, but you can make a great film just by showing how people feel, no agenda necessary. 

Absolute worst scene: Ruben tries fixing the roof, Joe tells him ""You don't need to fix anything here."" My eyes rolled all the way back in my head when I heard that. In a movie that was otherwise fine script-wise, it's by far the hackiest thing they do. 2 hours ago I thought there was no chance anyone could ever convince me that Daniel Kaluuya shouldn't absolutely run away with the supporting actor oscar...but god damn Paul Raci was incredible in this. It is a sad movie, but also eye opening. How small things can alter our lives.. we spend everyday worrying about futilities, and only when we lose what we used to take for granted that we know how much it is worth.
If there is one word i could get out of this movie, it would be ""GRATITUDE"" ENDING TAKE: This is for the immediate ending, the very last scene. The sounds of a sheltered and controlled existence become very distinct when he is leaving Lou's place (birds, then motorcycle, stairs, door slamming). Then when walking in to the outside the sound distortion starts to kick-in and you start hearing more noises blending together in uncontrolled chaos. Now here is the absolute key parts of the ending. The church bells ring, the clanging of the bells represents his old life pre-hearing loss (sounds similar to cymbals on a drum kit). Then you also see the two kids playing with the skateboard which represents the life he lived at the rehab facility when he was interacting with the kids at the deaf school. He takes off his implants while listening to the church bells, which represents his realizing that he will never be able to live his past life. Then you see another shot of him looking at the kids with the skateboard and it's silent, that represents him realizing that if he wants to he can move on from his old life and still feel fulfilled in this world doing something else, like he was when he was helping the kids at the deaf school. 

Also the last scene is shot in such a way that yes, being able to hear sound has it's own beauty, but in a world so chaotic as ours (a busy cityscape is the perfect place to illustrate this point), being able to not hear and enjoy stillness can be a blessing sometimes and not perceived as a handicap (as alluded to multiple times previously). In a way, the non-deaf population has simulated this feeling with noise-cancelling headphones, ear-plugs, and other devices that try to block noise completely. Gosh, this movie was simply amazing. I was enthralled from beginning to end, and Riz Ahmed was a revelation. I'll really be rooting for him to get some awards recognition & love, as well as for this movie as a whole. It has a quiet power to it that I think could propel it to being an awards darling -- though I know there are a lot of heavy-hitters coming during this atypical awards season.

Something I wanted to talk about was this movie's effortless case for why Representation matters. I talked about this with someone after watching, but have you ever seen a movie where there was a big dinner table scene that featured a bunch of people just talking in sign language? Those scenes in particular I found to be quite beautiful in their modesty. I loved the scenes with the deaf community -- both with the kids at the school and the adults at the house. So many moving & incredibly powerful moments. This cast also was quite racially diverse, too, I must say, with of course the lead of this movie being Pakistani.

Representation matters. Diverse opinions and diverse groups could lead to some diverse & incredible storytelling. Sound of Metal is a clear result of that. Bravo to Darius Marder and team. I watched this wearing my nice Sennheiser headphones and maaaaan what an experience. Loved this film

The ending scene where Ruben finally embraces the stillness is beautiful. There are movies that show underrepresented communities in a thought-provoking light, there are movies that have poignant commentaries on life and love, and then there’s Sound of Metal that does both. 

I expected this movie to be a lot more clinical going into it as the only thing I knew was that it was about a drummer losing his hearing. I wasn’t expecting all the moments with Lou and Joe. Those bits really tugged at my heartstrings — all the performance knocked it out of the park. Just finished, fantastic performance from Riz Ahmed. I love that Ruben finally found some stillness at the end. Paul Raci needs a best supporting nom, and Riz put in the best performance of the year. Cooke should be in the conversation as well for best supporting. I'm not sure if anyone's mentioned this, but I appreciate the casting of Mathieu Amalric as Lou's dad, as he also played the guy with locked-in syndrome in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (I'm sure this was a conscious casting decision) The Sound of Metal was written and directed by Darius Marder. It's the story of Ruben, a drummer on tour with a metal band. His life comes to a halt when he begins rapidly losing his hearing. As he grapples with his new reality and history of heroin addiction, he checks himself into a substance recovery group for a deaf community. Very few films can achieve the level of connection this movie makes you feel for its lead character. 

You dont just feel for Ruben, you participate in his crisis alongside him. The film doesnt try to explain anything to you, instead you experience everything as he does. It gives the audience a sensory connection to the events. It is not just the emotionally devastating performance by Riz Ahmed as Ruben. The film uses sound to tell the story as much as what you are seeing on the screen.

It moves easily between the chaotic noise of a life on the road as a metal musician, to a suffocating tension as the sounds are gradually replaced with ringing and muffled voices that sound as if they are coming through so much water. It will occasionally pull away from its lead character to contrast the muted world that he is not quite adjusting to. And in a few perfect sequences, the film captures moments of perfect stillness that left me feeling weightless. 

It is not an easy thing to watch or to hear. It is not a pleasant thing to feel the losses of ambitions and comfort, that come from adapting to a new normal. But I did not end the viewing feeling drained or sad. The ending felt complete and cathartic. I cant wait to see what else Darius Marder and Riz Ahmed have in store for the future.

My score:
9.4/10 Incredible movie. Watched it last night with a friend who is a sign language interpreter. I'm also a drummer.

The acting was so good and the sound editing to go between ""normal"" hearing and what Ruben was experiencing really gave you a feel of what he was going through. I also liked how they didn't have subtitles for the sign language when Ruben didn't understand sign but as time passed and he understood it more it gave the viewers subtitles to let you know Ruben knew what was being signed too.

Just an all around fantastic movie. I hope it wins some awards. Had no idea that lady from the walking dead was actually deaf in real life. loved the ending shot where he finally sits in silence with the crowd. Just the way it was like his thoughts floating in and out of his head just completely visualized on screen. 

The way he was framed with the crowd behind him almost resembling the kids at the community and then an old man pass by as they pass by what looks like entering into his ear. then the woman pushing a stroller moving out of his ears as he accepts his new direction and that idea of future with lou drifts away. 

just really well done and stuck with me. I have never seen a movie tackle deafness in this way. That early dinner scene where it cuts in and out of our perspective and Ruben’s was really fucking cool.

You from this quiet frantic looking scene to just a perfectly normal lively dinner when the sound is cut.

Really beautiful movie and I don’t think I will ever forget the last couple scenes. I cried so hard when he and Lou were in bed together. Great movie. Jarring ending and I wish there had been more music/drum connection in the last third. Also, insanely anxiety inducing. In the second to last scene where he’s leaving her bedroom, he’s surrounded by instruments and musical equipment. The walls are literally packed with nothing but music. He wouldn’t be able to get away from it in that life, he’d always be on the outside trying to listen in. I loved this movie. I was so uncomfortable and almost aggravated by the audio. Just mimics the smallest portion of what Ruben was feeling. So cool how they involved watchers into the hearing loss experience. Wow, Riz Ahmed delivers a great performance in this beautiful movie. I noticed so many shots capturing sounds of simple things like winds moving through fields, insects chirping in the dark, planes moving in the sky and birds singing in the forest which really makes us appreciate such simple things that we usually take for granted. That scene with Joe and Ruben was fantastic, Joe really points it out well that Ruben stopped doing drugs with Lou entering her life but in the end she became very drug that he later became addicted too. Great sound design as well, those scenes after Ruben got his implants activated were so jarring and put a dagger through my stomach knowing how much pain he went through to make his condition even worse. I just want to say.. This movie was amazing.

I understand the situation with the deaf community.. But it felt way too harsh on Ruben. Getting his hearing partially back, doesn't prevent him from teaching deaf kids how to play the drums, nor does it mean he is back to what he used to be, which is obvious. 

I feel like the community situation represented the two extremes. Ruben, who is obsessed with getting things back to how they were in their prime and Joe, who accepts his deafness to the point of obsession as well. The scene where Ruben is fixing the roof is the perfect contrast. ""We have people who believe that deafness doesn't need fixing"" which is true and that's an amazing outlook in life. But Ruben got deaf from literally a moment to the other, his life was going great and then the ONLY place he can go, is a community that literally forces him to ditch his life. No car? No phone? Complete disconnection? That just feels like total isolation.. It's positive when you see everyone happy, but for someone like Ruben, his life doesn't revolve around being deaf, it only just changed to that.

That's why I feel like the ending is perfect.. He doesn't belong with the community because they clearly don't accept them. But his old life is never coming back either. He can carve his own path now, listen when he wants to and take it off when he needs peace. And that's just the perfect balance. The breakup scene was sad yet somehow touching and beautiful. Very interesting to see how addiction is portrayed as something larger than being addicted to drugs, it can also manifest as an addiction to the chaotic and nostalgic past. By far the most powerful scene and in my opinion the climax of the whole film was the discussion in which the disappointed but sad deaf program director painfully tells Ruben to leave, with the very touching explanation that being deaf was merely a mental handicap, not something to be desperately fixed. It was definitely a very difficult decision that shows the deep loyalty of the instructor to the other deaf people at the commune as well as his uncompromising sense of integrity. Very powerful stuff. The breakup scene at the end was heartbreaking. I didn't really see it coming, at least not in the beginning. If anything, she came across as needy, and I thought that he would be the one ready to move on. What do you think happened in the months that they were apart? He's fighting to get his life with her back and she's quickly moving on after 4 years?  I know that she was scratching but they seemed to really love each other. I immediately enjoyed how they started developing the characters, highlighting the meat is murder sticker, Lous scars and subtle nods to their personalities and story. Over all I enjoyed the story and it thought it was great to see such a unique experience get the spot light. Can anyone explain why towards the film's end, Lou looks so uncomfortable and anxious while she is singing the piano song in french? 

Also, what a wonderful song! Is there any link to the original track? Wow. Riz Ahmed was fantastic, cinematography was terrific. One of the most compelling movies I’ve ever seen! Riz Ahmed really solidified himself with this performance. Just the kick in the ass I needed. A drama about a drummer named Ruben who losses his hearing. Played masterfully by Riz Ahmed. Starts by kicking us right in the middle of his band's show. Loud noises, vibrant colors, a drunken crowd shot you can almost smell them. Just an overload of senses on screen. Cut to the next scene. Him waking up, drinking a green smoothie, doing some calisthenics, putting on some Jazz while he makes breakfast for his girlfriend. I haven't been so hooked in the first 5 minutes of a movie in a long time.

&#x200B;

The characters are all fleshed out. Three dimensional humans who have all been through some shit. Resilient, fighters who are still here making the most of their situation. Everyone in the film deserves a movie but this is Ruben's. 

&#x200B;

Not often do films come around that make you thankful for bad situations. 2020 has been rough, but were still here, making it through the best we can. ""Sound of Metal"" is just stellar and one of the best the year has to offer. At the risk of sounding stupid, why did Joe get really upset when he caught Ruben fixing the roof? 

It goes without saying that this was amazing. I agree with everyone else about how it subverted my expectations. It's funny how we're so trained to expect certain things. I was expecting Lou to have to turn to crime to pay for his hearing equipment and an inevitable scene where he secretly gets jumped lmao. 

But what I got instead, a poetic character piece about accepting certain situations (along with being an ode to the deaf community) was way better! This probably is my movie of the year. It just took the whole year to see it! watched this ahead of the Oscars and i enjoyed the movie so much. I really hope it gets to win in some of the categories it’s nominated in, especially sound editing. 

Riz did such an amazing job, and the final scene when he took off the implants and got to have that moment of stillness Joe was talking about almost had me in tears. Amazing name as well. Just finished this film last night and WOW!! That ending!! Beautiful! I’m a recovering addict and so much of recovery is about surrendering your will and accepting the things you cannot change. I thought that ending scene represented that PERFECTLY. Talk about quite literally turning off the noise of the world, and FINALLY finding that stillness...but only once we surrender and accept that in which we can’t change nor control. Beautiful!! As someone who has hearing loss (but is not fully deaf), the film was quite emotional for me and certainly “rang true”, no pun intended. The scene where Ruben first realizes the first signs of trouble recall mine. It is terrifying when you realize that something is not quite right with your hearing. You almost want to deny it as a “one off”. That scene brought tears to my eyes.

One thing I am curious about: I always thought those who are 100% deaf have distorted speech because they can’t hear themselves talk. Am I wrong in that? I figured Ruben and/or the others at the ranch would follow this speech pattern but they didn’t. Not knocking the film but I expected their speech attempts (if any) to be different.

Anyway, Ahmed is an excellent and very intuitive actor...perfect for this role. I thought the actor who portrayed Joe, the head of the camp, was very moving and I’m not surprised to hear (again, no pun intended) that he comes from a deaf family. I was also not aware that the deaf community views those who get cochlear implants with some disdain. I didn’t know that was a thing. That option was presented to me when I first exhibited my own hearing loss but fortunately, it hasn’t gotten to that level yet.

TL;DR: as someone who is also hearing impaired, this film had a big impact on me. I also appreciate the fact that the film touched on other issues like addiction and wasn’t simply about hearing loss to the exclusion of all else. I swear to God, if Riz Ahmed doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this... I finished the movie an hour ago, but it will be on my mind for quite awhile. It certainly reminds you not to take things for granted. I had expected to shed a few tears, and while I did not actually do so, I feel hollow.      

Riz Ahmed was amazing as I had expected, I have no doubt he will get more and more leading roles. I hope he at a minimum gets an Oscar nod. I've been following him since I saw him in Nightcrawler and he's a pleasure to watch.   
Lastly, I know the deaf community is real and I was impressed by their acting - their strength showed and is very admirable. The title of the movie wasn't said out loud. 

But it was said. Biggest take away: white people with rich parents are the biggest posers in existence lol 
Fuck Lou Really solid movie with really solid acting. I love that Riz learned drumming and ASL for the role, that is commitment. He played the role to a T. Olivia was amazing as well. Olivia has the voice for the genre too which is awesome. I was expecting it to be a run of the mill metal band but they went somewhat post-metal/experimental with it, which as a fan of that type of music, and a musician myself, I was delighted to see.

It also resonated with me as I worked with children, two kids I worked with were deaf so I learned some ASL myself. It made me actually miss working with kids in general. I think at the end he realized that life actually made him happy, although he does miss the rock star life.

I did however think the ending was kinda obvious. It's not OBVIOUS but I've seen so many of these dramas that I was pretty sure she'd find a new life and he will throw a new life away to go to her, only to be disappointed. I was, however, shocked he took his hearing aids out. I hope that signals for him returning to working with the kids.

All and all, solid 8.5 out of me. Can see this being a best picture nominee for sure. I remember reading about the working concept of this film years and years ago and thought it sounded very interesting.  I think it lived up to expectations.  One of the best of the year. This was a surprisingly spiritual film (in the best way). This was easily one of the best of the year The only fiction on this movie is how all the doctors/pharmacist writes elegantly. Kidding aside, I watched this after Minari and you can really appreciate the art in film. I cried the entire time.  I’ve had hearing loss and I’m a musician.. it’s affected me for higher and lower tones, and mid is ok- volume is tricky, I need tv louder, music louder and conversations cannot be mumbled.. 

This movie spoke to my fears.. and the struggle of not being able to hear.  I’m lucky that mine does come back most of the time.. but there are days that go by when I wander in that quiet haze, struggling to hear the water in the shower, my own voice- doing anything I can to get a clear sound.  That resonated with me so deep down.  

Sleeping is the worst- they referenced that with him being up so early- that could be an addict thing too, though- I have no experience with that..  all I know is when I can’t hear and I sleep, I fear nothing will wake me.  I wear my watch with the vibrate alarm on all the time. 

This movie was so good, so very very good.  I’m disappointed in the ending- no tie in from the deaf community to the outside world.. deaf people are the outside world too- I find it impossible that he didn’t see another deaf person on his entire journey to Paris.. and the effect of once you learn something new you notice it everywhere HAD to happen..  but I’m still happy with it. 

Performances and sound scales were absolutely amazing. Tattoo on upper right arm?

Admittedly, I have way too much free time on my hands these days, and I've watched this movie several times. I couldn't help but to notice the tattoo on Rubi's right arm. Is it men's briefs? What is it? Maybe a little late to this movie...

Just watched it. These types of movies I never really liked...

Holy hell I loved this one. The scene ruban is done with his rehab and learning to be deaf was so well done. Joe offering for ruban to stay and you can tell he wants to, but thinks can go back to normal. One of my favorites of the year - no surprise, but Riz Ahmed was unbelievable. Looking forward to whatever propels him to the next echelon, hopefully this is it. As a musician with a small amount of hearing loss, this movie is my worst nightmare. It’s beautiful though that given Ruben’s experience, life goes on, even after the worst nightmare. Find your moments of stillness. A+ [deleted] Massive film. It was only while reading the comments in this thread that I realized Ahmed was the kid from Nightcrawler. Holy shit.

Also, Rudimentary Peni shirt! I can't stop thinking about this movie since I watched it last night. It's really good, and while I have a few nitpicky problems with it I think it's probably the best movie I've seen in a year. What a tragically sad but also beautiful story. I hope it wins some Oscars It was so good. 15 minutes in when Ruben's sitting in the sound booth, I started crying. I've had ear problems for the majority of my life and was in those sound booths many times during my childhood. Brought back a lot of scary memories. I was really expecting this to be my favorite film of the year and it almost was. But the more I thought of it after watching it, the more I realized some things were bugging me.

**Where's the music?**

* I thought the introduction at the beginning was disappointing. His band sounded amateur. Then there's the fact that we jump directly into the hearing loss part. We never really had a chance to feel for passion for music. At least I didn't. One shot of playing the drums doesn't emit that much emotion, it's not enough to show his connection to music. Apart from drumming a bit with the kids, that's the last we see of music and it doesn't make any sense. Maybe this was done intentionally, and we're supposed to see that he was a mediocre musician and the name of the film has nothing to do with music but>! with the metallic noises he hears at the end.!< But then where did he get the money to refurbish the van like that? It looked like an expensive van. Is it implied that it was Lou's dad's money? Because that looks like and 100k+ investment and that band doesn't sound like it would be making them a lot of money. If it was with her dad's money why doesn't she offer to take him to a specialist and maybe find a possible treatment?  Like at least try. I can't see this other than a convenient plot point >!for him to end up all alone at the end. !<

**His girlfriend**

* >!A  lot of telling instead of showing, again. We find out that most likely she's been the reason he's sober but she doesn't seem supportive now.  She just kind of abandons him? The way they communicate after he finds out he's going completely deaf is nonsense. If they had such a strong relationship but she just picks up her things and orders a car to the airport without discussing him first? Why, how? I wish they included a part where she at least struggles with the idea of leaving him.!<
* >!I thought him being a musician would be a much bigger deal of the story l but it's not about the music at all. It turns out he's getting cochlear implants for her, for the girlfriend who abandons him and then moves to Paris without telling him.!<

&#x200B;

**The Deaf Community**

* >!He just fits right in. Sure, he shows some rage when he's in the writing room but other than he just learns to be deaf in a hot minute. One moment he's in a classroom not even knowing how to say his name in sign language, a few moments later he's signing perfectly and he's offered a  job at the center. The transition felt too smooth to me. It was the acting but the editing.!<

>!The implants!<

* >!Everybody brushes off that he's dead set into getting the implants. Nobody takes time to talk to him about it, apparently not even the doctors. The whole conversation with the implants doctor and the being release after a major surgery looks like a lawsuit waiting to happen. It sort of implies doctors some money-hungry vampires that split open your skull just like that. There are protocols, they give you disclaimers before the surgery, there's a recovery period in the hospital.!<

>!Being cast off from the deaf community!<

* >!Getting implants doesn't mean you automatically get back to hearing. Especially when the initial loss was that bad. Setting this aside, I do understand that people in the community don't want to treat it as a disability. But Ruben was clearly struggling with the idea of losing his hearing, he mentioned the implants right and the beginning and people don't just magically adjust to a completely new life just because he learned signed language. Writing in a  notebook every day is not therapy, and it doesn't help everyone cope with this kind of life-altering situation. Even Joe turned to alcohol in the beginning to cope, I feel like he's asking too much of Ruben. He needs time to accept what's happened to him.!<
* >!I totally understand and support not giving him the money to buy back the van. But throwing him on the street a day after having surgery, not having any place to go?  What kind of a person/community does that? If one person can jeopardize the entire community because they made a personal choice that sounds more like a cult than a support community. It's not like Ruben would be walking around there encouraging everyone to get the implants. He made a choice for himself. A choice that I thought was a bad idea not because I think implants are wrong or total acceptance of going deaf is right, but because he made the decision when he was desperate. It's a major decision that required research and knowledge and time to consider what's right for him. Not the community, not his girlfriend, but for him. I really think this part could have been done a bit better. I know it was done so he would feel he's all alone at the end and accept being in silence but it's kinda laid on thick.!<

**The girlfriend again**

>!How does he still money to travel to Paris after spending it all on the surgery?!<

* >!And when he gets there he finds out she's not really planning on being with him or moving back to America. I'm skeptical he would accept the break-up that calmly.!<
* >!I don't have an issue with her doing what's best for her happiness. It's the way she does it rubs me the wrong way. Maybe in the time apart she realized her mental health was worse on the road. But I do have an issue with how she left, very cowardly and that she didn't want to go back to their old life or be with him. He didn't need to find this out in Paris. She's such a selfish coward. She knew he asked her to wait for him. The issue I have with this arc is that the film is portraying her as a sympathetic character and that we should feel sorry for her but I don't think it's the case.!<
* >!At the end, it just seems like a romaticised version of what it would be like when we find out we lost everything. He got those implants because he thought their relationship would go back to how it was but in the end, when he realizes he has nothing, no money, no girlfriend, no community, no support, no future, he had no reaction at all. He's calm and composed and finally gets the meaning of ""The kingdom of God is in the silence"".  This seems like a cliche for me. !<

For me it was a good movie that had the potential to be great but wasn't because all of the above. My one issue with the movie is how did he get the surgery and seemingly nobody explained to him how it worked, how it restores his hearing, and the quality of that sound until he actually puts on the device. Like he should have been well informed by doctors at that point but instead he's walking around thinking he'll have perfect hearing and is then shocked at how bad everything sounds Is a cochlear implant really sound like that? Everything sounded distorted. Just seen it and loved it. Riz is a fucking genius. Not exactly comparable, but this movie hit me hard because I have worsening tinnitus lately & probably shouldn’t go to concerts Had the pleasure of watching this one on the big screen a few months ago at a festival. Incredible sound design, and just a great film all around. Riz Ahmed deserves all the accolades, but it was Raci's performance which will stay in my memory for a long time. Funny that the story was by Derek Cianfrance, during the movie I was thinking about how similar Ruben looked and acted like Luke in Place Beyond the Pines (written and directed by Derek Cianfrance)

This was the first film in awhile that I’ve genuinely loved. I've been struggling with some unexplained tinnitus for a few years, and this movie stressed the shit out of me.  I say unexplained because I am not a metal drummer and have been abundantly cautious with loud noise for most of my life.

Good film, but I had to pause it a few times and go do something else because I was getting too uncomfortable. When Ruben's at the deaf community the first task he's given is; ""learn how to be deaf"". 

At the end he's finally learned. 

Also, this is Riz Ahmed's second film released this year in which he plays a musician who suffers from a sudden disability. 'Mogul Mowgli' being the other. Hands down the best film I've seen this year... GISM I've been a fan of Riz Ahmed ever since I saw him in *Four Lions* a decade ago and it's been a delight watching his career progress the way it has. This is by far his best performance to date. You really get the sense of him traveling through anger, denial, bargaining, and all of the other steps of recovery on his way to acceptance. The film was directed so well; Darius Marder shows Ruben's isolation when he loses his hearing and then its progression after he gets his hearing back through framing. Paul Raci and Olivia Cooke give great supporting performances as well, but the real star of the film is the sound design. Whoever mixed and edited this film needs an Oscar immediately. I thought the final half hour dragged on a bit long, especially with Mathieu Almaric, but overall it was a solid film and hopefully it's the next step on the road to more great projects for everyone involved. does anyone know where the find the end credit song ? couldn’t find it on streaming What a beautiful, powerful movie; my favorite of the year so far. Riz Ahmed’s been on my radar since The Night Of (watched Nightcrawler recently too and liked him in that), but this blew me away. Really hope he gets recognized come award season. Those last couple scenes had me just staring at the screen for a minute or two after it ended. Okay I know I’m in the minority on this one, but does anyone feel like this movie wasn’t as good as the hype? Don’t get me wrong, it was a decent movie, but there just wasn’t an “oh my God” moment or something that kept me on the edge of my seat. I watch every movie that is up for Oscar nominations every year and I just don’t think this movie was up to the Parasite level. Like I said, it was a decent movie but just didn’t do it for me in terms of being an amazing movie. In the credits Olivia Cooke and riz Ahmed actually wrote lots of the music... interesting I love the double meaning of the title 10/10 movie, best of the year Best movie scene: first minutes were HUGE! LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie, this cast, the directors who are also the screenwritiers ahhh

everything was perfectly paced and it wasn't cliche.

it made me rethink everything on my ears cause i work on production.

wonderful, wondeful movie.

havent used my bose headphones in 6 weeks, but gonna use then till they need replacing cause sound is everything to me. As someone with a minor hearing impairment, that was really tough to watch. Seeing him lose his hearing while also losing his old life was heartbreaking but it was wholesome to see him briefly enjoy the community and embrace his deafness. Unfortunately, as most people would, he chose to go back to his old life and completely blew the chance to create a new path. 

The absence of sound and how they made Ruben and the audience aware of how things would sound if he goes back to playing the drums was amazing. My heart sank when the church bells rang and it sounded like cymbals and he had to take off his device.

However, I'm glad he finally found his peace and was able to sit still at the end. What a beautiful film! The audio in this movie was amazing. Riz’ trailer breakdown scene gives him the oscar in my books [deleted] I really really liked this movie. But I'm curious, is this at all accurate to what sound with a hearing implant is really like? I'm sure it is nothing like real sound, and I'm sure it does sound unpleasant at times, but it can't be *that bad* when its working properly, can it? One of the best movies. Apart from superb acting, sound effects were used in perfect manner. It was sad though but ending was absolutely cathartic and made sense. Unfortunately, I didn't boogie with this movie. It just didn't captivate or intrigue me. And it's not an instance of ""oh, I've seen something like this before that's lesser known and was done better."" I just simply... was bored. I'll try to explain:

I was a bit put off by the relationship of the leads in the opening. The scene where they're first driving and we're peering in from the back seemed like improv, which okay, great, but it seemed like it was from a place of a couple barely getting to know each other. At that point, I had no idea how long they've been together so I can't quite judge, but it turns out they've been together for 4 years. So off the bat, it's not entirely ringing true to me.

I feel like there's been talk of Riz Ahmed for a few years now being such a great actor. Am I missing something? Is he on a show that I just don't watch? Everything I've seen him in, he's been surface level at best. Venom and Rogue One are obviously the most mainstream and flat performances, but even in Nightcrawler I just thought ""yeah, he's decent."" And here, which I would say is his best performance so far, he still seems a bit performative like he's dramatizing his emotions a bit to be captured instead of naturally living the scenes as they go. A bit extra twitchy and eye move-y and such that some actors do to make it look like they're conveying an emotion instead of actually having one. I could get more into the technicalities of acting, but for the sake of simplicity, I won't.

The writing seemed a bit awkward with how people interacted with each other. Especially with how Ruben's character is at this place to cope with his hearing loss, he was pretty much a prick to everyone for the first half of the movie. He doesn't desperately do whatever he can to learn from others, instead he's scoffing and acting non-plus by everyone. He wants to go back to his old life, yet isn't willing to take the steps to get there? Dude just seemed like a douche for no reason, it didn't ring true, his behavior honestly didn't look like he'd willingly be there under any circumstances if that's how he acted, even if it was for his girlfriend.

I thought Paul Raci was pretty great, could definitely see him securing a nom for Best Supporting. I think he's one of my only main positives about this movie. At this point midway into the movie, my score is hovering around a 6 or a 5, but after Paul Raci's final scene (which is the scene I think could be his nom securing moment), this movie dipped to a 4 or a 3.5 for me as it suddenly nose dived into a place that just worked even less for me.

Olivia Cooke was... fine. I was waiting for her to have a really good moment. Her character didn't ring true to me either. The transition at the end to assimilating to that lifestyle just didn't seem believable. Their nomad/gypsy lifestyle before just seemed to cleanly be gone. While this happens to many people and they go through phases, I think the very idea that this was something she did for money, I don't see it easily being stripped clean from her personality like that. The ""old her"" seemed almost completely gone. Just a different look in her eyes all together and like a new character, which I'm sure is the point but in that time span it just felt like forced for the sake of the movie and to help jolt our lead's acceptance of his situation.

Speaking of which, the final scene of him just kinda coming to terms in some sort of way, learning to deal with his new situation and realizing his old life will never come back? The overwhelming sound of the bells seemed too easy. This dude went through a lot of turmoil, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, and did a whole lot just to retain that tiny bit of hearing. With what we've seen of his character's behavior before and his frustrations at that party and the way his girlfriend suddenly seems fine not living their old lifestyle, this acceptance coming in this moment felt fake for the sake of a movie moment. This would be something he'd be visibly frustrated with for years to come and seems like the actual thing he would NOT accept. Yet I'm supposed to believe he finds his moment of stillness in one scene? Comparing this to another drummer movie about obsession, Whiplash perfectly captured a dickhead we could root for because it was easy to understand him and care by seeing how willing he'd put up with shit. I don't think I ever understood Ruben or cared, because in the beginning he seemed so unwilling to do anything. Dude didn't even tell his girlfriend he went deaf until a whole day after.

And the whole ending in general was so lackluster compared to the rest of the movie. I was now realizing a lot of scenes throughout just came and went and happened without any impact to the rest of the story, or dragged even if the movie had a pretty decent pace in editing. It was around this point that I really wished we got to see the documentary this is based on instead as that would at least have some natural catharsis.

4/10, and if that's if I'm being generous. I can see myself forgetting I even saw this movie in a few days and dropping this to a 3. This Oscar season is already shaping up to be pretty terrible, but I guess that only makes sense considering its 2020 and coming off 2019 as one of the best. Might be my favorite movie of the year. Riz absolutely deserves a best acting nomination. I thought the sound design was great since so much of the story is told through that. I would like to know what deaf people think of the film, and I hope the subtitles were utilized to their fullest extent to communicate all the sound cues throughout.

The ending worked for me, but I wish that the story was about him dealing with him losing his hearing over a period of time. The opening scene had me thinking that we would be introduced to the character right in the middle (or even towards the end) of his hearing loss. But the film treats his predicament very quickly without him having any prior knowledge of some sort of hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss is a rare thing but it DOES happen, so there is a solid reasoning behind his hearing loss in the film. But it seems more fitting that a metal musician would be suffering from progressive hearing loss.

Also, I thought the credits should’ve been silent. The film starts with noise, and it ends with silence. Gives a good reason to keep that silence, and that feeling of calm, going into the credits. One of the most emotional films I've ever seen maybe? Absolutely unlike any other film I've ever seen as far as the *experience* of watching it goes, but that's obvious if you've seen the movie. Remarkable filmmaking in my opinion. A front runner for my favorite movie of the year so far. *spoiler*

Awesome movie. Character reactions seemed on point as far as being genuine. I liked that there wasn’t any random 180 being pulled where a character acts....out of character?....just for the sake of “a lesson learned”. Even though his experience in the home was relatively good, he ultimately still wanted what he originally strived for. At the end he seemed to *appreciate* his situation to a degree and in a realistic way under the circumstances.  Compared to the directors other movies (which I think are all incredible), this definitely can be considered the closest to a feel good ending. This movie has made me come back again and again to read people's comments because itbhas somehow created this unique human reaction feom those who've seen it. Both if they have any closeness to the topic or not.

I keep thinking about it.

I really think both Riz and Paci deserve some nominations. Their scenes were just so good. I fucking love this movie. Masterfully made. Fantastic performances all around- Ahmed, Raci (insanely good), Cooke and even Almeric and the cast at the school/community. The sound mixing/editing was incredible. Not that there's a huge selection to choose from, but this is likely film of the year to me. 

I've yet to see Tenet. [deleted] This movie was so great I just discovered I watched it without the subtitles and it was still gripping af. I find it ironic how the movie has this major theme of acceptance and moving on yet preaches that a loss of a significant sense is not a handicap and portrays a condescending look towards those who do surgery.. why can't it just be a acceptance of the disability..
It's only logical that more research is done on this front and  the aids become on par with real ears. i liked the movie, but for some reason i found it uncomfortable to watch. There’s still a lot of movies I want to see like Black Bear, Nomadland, but I can already see this being one of my favourites of this year, I’ve been quite interested reading critiques from the deaf community as well as audiologists like an earlier comment here, as someone with hearing I took a lot of things at face value, for example the shock of how the implants sounded, the earlier comment about the discussions that would have been had are important, but in retrospect Ruben was so laser focused on getting his hearing back, that all he would have had to hear would be that “there’s a chance” and gone with it anyway. I’m someone who gets really anxious around too much noise, too many people talking over each other, abrasive sounds like alarms, and the scenes after he got the implants made me want to crawl out of my skin but it was incredibly effective. So many scenes stand out, but I loved the scene towards the end where he’s watching Lou sing at the party, sad and beautiful.

As others have mentioned I really enjoyed how this movie subverts expectations, I thought Ruben was going to hook up with the teacher, didn’t happen, thought he would stay at the school, didn’t happen which made the rest of the story more heartbreaking, he was really fitting in at the school and the kids seemed to like him, another movie would have tied that up with a happy ending, but threw you for a loop.

Kind of rambling here because I’m still processing how good this was, it’s felt like forever since I’ve watched a new film that really hit me in the gut like this one did, it’s not perfect of course, some scenes felt underwritten and the span of time was not clear, was he at the school for days, months? But that said I can’t praise it enough and I look forward to annoying my friends into trying to watch it. This is one of best films I've ever seen. I laughed, I cried and just a really damn good movie. 
I give this movie 🎷👐🎷👐🎷👐🎷👐🎷 I need some clarification regarding the end of the movie.

>!When Lou and Ruben are talking on the bed and talking and she starts scratching her arms. Does that imply that Lou has started using drugs? Because the way Ruben stares at Lou's arm and then back at her and consoles her by saying ""It's okay, Lou."" suggests that she's started using during his absence? !<

>!But also that he's letting go and telling her that it's okay to let go of their past? !<

I've not seen anybody else mention the former. Just the latter. Please help clarify this scene for me. Or if I'm just misreading or reading too much into it.

Thanks :) Riz Ahmed absolutely killed his role in this one. Good film although maybe a little too long (running time 120 minutes). I’m excited to see him in Mogul Mowgli which has gotten a bunch of good reviews in England. Does Anyone have a way to watch it in the United States? I watched this movie because I play the drums and love heavy music, so I went in for that reason alone, not hearing about this movie beforehand. I was simply looking for something to watch on a Friday night and this caught my eye on Amazon prime. I’ll be honest, I was pretty critical about the “metal” music at the beginning, but soon learned that wasn’t what this movie was about. Needless to say, this was quite a moving story. When it ended I was expecting more, but thinking about it more, it ended well. The “stillness” Ruben was in really speaks for itself. Seems like even though it seemed like he was getting better and even happier when staying at the home, in the back of his head he was still thinking about forgetting it all and chasing his old life which he thought would fulfill him. Even the look on his face in the last scene you can tell he’s learned and is still learning a lesson through all of it. Definitely will be recommending this to friends. this is a horror film 100 percent. almost too visceral. Yeah this one easily became a top 10 or even maybe top 5 this year for me, I loved the simplicity and that it went right to the point without trying to overcomplicate things. Also, this dude can ACT. What was the song that Lou sings with her dad? Or he never gets caught using the computer, and Lou doesn't find new love in Paris... I DEFINITELY thought something would happen with that teacher lol I know! I was literally expecting EVERY one of them. Also, was mentioned, Lou didn’t find a new love and I expected that. Crazy. What a mind fuck it all was. Brilliant. I hate to admit it but I definitely thought he and the teacher were going to get together.

I also thought Lou was gonna tell him she’s moved on. When he was back on the ciggies towards the end I was worried. Yea from a technical aspect the sound mixing replicating Ruben's experience was fantastic.  I was especially impressed when they had us hear what he was hearing when the implant was fired up and at the party.

I have a family member with an implant and he said that was actually pretty accurate. He also said you typically adapt to it over time and it becomes more natural, but yea it was disappointing at first. Sound editing and mixing here was awesome. Gonna be toe to toe with Mank imo Yes! Masterful! I watched this movie with my new sound bar.

Holy hell man, my room was rumbling for like the entire movie. The sound of metal Them listening to the piano was really great as well What shot are you talking about? In my mind, the scene itself was beautiful, not one particular shot. One of those movies where I look back at that scene and almost put myself in tears again. So simple but so powerful Completely blew me away, for lack of using that cliche. So, so powerful. I’m late deafened and just got my cochlear implant 3 months ago. That scene was incredibly powerful 😭 I just finished the movie and friggin bawled at that last scene. What a great movie It took me too long to understand, but when I finally clicked that he was getting that moment of stillness, I just fucking wept. Despite all that, he had finally found peace and was in a position where he was able to sit and be still with his own thoughts. That in my opinion is scary as hell, but then you accept it, and move on one day at a time. Just another challenge. I think he is now at peace with it. Brings us back to what Joe said about that stillness being his kingdom of god and that it will never abandon him, just like joe and Lou did. Facts. I was waiting for them to reveal that Lou was fucking some handsome French guy and already forgot about Ruben I was disappointed that Lou didn't write to him like he asked (unless I missed it) 🤯

You really are a dr scientist AND the sound of the metal slide. The title represents Ruben’s entire arc! Ooh great catch, could it also be an homage to the classic, Sound of Silence? I interpreted it as him tapping the slide for the kid but I think all three of these are right Riz Ahmed is fucking incredible.  Throughout the entire film, his performance was consistently strong and he really showed the characters emotions and evolution of those emotions changing over time and a lot of it just through expression.  He says so much without saying anytihng.  Of course, credit to the director and the cinematographers but wow, what a performance. The movie was really well researched (besides maybe the DIY Music Scene) : deaf people often think about the implants as a way to erase their culture Paul Raci should win an Oscar for that scene alone Shit, Ahmed sold it in The Night Of. He's been on my radar for a minute. Really good in Nightcrawler too This was so heartbreaking but beautiful to read. I hope you are doing so much better now. Thank you for being so personal and sharing this with us. Thank you for sharing this. Hope you're doing better now! Thank you for sharing.  I don't make metal music, but I do appreciate it.  I do make music, and if you ever want to make some anonymously together, I'd be happy to do that.  

Feels weird saying that, but you opened up, so I return with what little gesture I can. I really was stoked on seeing Rudimentary Peni and Gism get so much screen time in 2020 All power to you, friend. I'm glad this movie was able to resonate with you so closely. Thank you for sharing this story with us, and I sincerely hope you found your peace from that time. I know this hella late but that was really a wonderful contribution. Hope you’ve found peace. Thank you for sharing your story, I hope you're doing well now! Hey man thank you for sharing that. How are things? Thank you for sharing. Hope you're doing well. Just watched this film and read your comment.  Please please please do not beat yourself up over what happened.   Life is full of mysterious twists and turns and will oftentimes lead us in directions we did not plan for.   At the end of the day you need to focus on your most important priority and that is yourself.  Too often do we chase dreamscapes only to be left disappointed.   You didn't make mistake, and your sobriety didn't fail.   You just made a conscious decision to do what is best for you, only to realize that it wasn't.  And that's ok.  It will always be ok.  As long as you can fight the fight one day at a time, you will win.  And you will be a better person when your head hits the pillow.  

You inspire me, and any others.  Keep fighting the good fight and you will always end up ahead. When Joe specifically called out that he was acting like an addict, something just clicked.  It was one of those few movies that showed that addiction is more than just running to drugs.  The selling of the motorhome did not hit me that he was basically pawning it.  The way Ruben clung to wanting things to return the way they were is what drove this story. Yep I've never heard of Raci before but he was brilliant. Would love to see him get a Best Supporting Actor nod. Loved that scene too, another one which subverted expectations, I was fully expecting Joe to loan him money, or at least let him work his debt off, but he sent him away, looked like it was really hard for Joe to do that because he saw a lot of potential in Ruben. Incredible scene, pretty much a clinic in acting. That scene is powerful. The way Joe handles the situation grasping his beliefs, values and respect for the others knowing how hard it will hit Ruben is tremendous. Would have loved to see Ruben back there embracing his quietude. Brilliantly acted. Yeah! The movie did a good job of presenting this. Whereas hearing through the typical acoustic pathways (sound through the air) is represented as a virtually continuous tonal spectrum, cochlear implants divide that range of pitches into ~20 discrete channels. Since CIs chop sound into a seemingly small amount of frequency ranges, it does seem robotic like the movie portrays, especially in background noise. Over long-term use, the brain adapts to that sound and it does seem more natural, but it is never the same as typical acoustic hearing. I thought he was drawing her porn at first. Like if it was contraband. [removed] I think Anthony Hopkins (The Father) and Chadwick Bozeman (Ma Rainey) are the frontrunners now. While I think Oldman is in for a nomination, I have not seen anyone predicting him to win. It's going to likely by Boseman or possibly Hopkins for his second. I'm all for Ahmed getting a nomination though. Unpopular opinion: Oldman was the least interesting park of Mank. [removed] Nice double entendre but I think the point of that scene was Ruben was avoiding how he was feeling, which provoked Joe to suggest setting aside time to feel his pent up anger and write his way through it. I got what they were trying to do, but thought the idea that Joe just lets his house fall into disrepair because it doesn't need fixing was a little silly. man i just watched this and did not pick up on that and i feel stupie now He says it in the movie itself that life just passes I thought the scene with the metal slide was the moment the movie's title had double meaning. It was the hearing impaired version of a title drop. I hadn’t made that connection. Wow. Absolutely heartbreaking. Ruben pretending to be enjoying it but realizing he’ll never hear music the same way is unimaginable, and Riz did such a great job portraying that. Yes, I thought the same thing when I saw Mathieu. Man after he got the cochlear implant and the sound was horrible I had a panic attack... > Movies were the main character goes through a medical ordeal in this way always unsettle me.

Sorry for the 4 months later reply but I just watched this movie and I have to say, you nailed it. Movies like this unsettle me more than most horror films. I worry entirely too much that I'm going to get some sudden diagnosis that I'll have to fight my insurance company to cover, and possibly lose, and then I'm out my life savings AND I've got a ""disability"". Genuinely terrifying. Same man! My ears felt so unsettled during this entire movie. It’s very scary. It happened to me randomly when I was 12!!!!!!!! So this movie was crazy emotional for me and also insanely accurate. But I personally thought I agreed with your thought that it was sad, spending that much money and it sounding terribly and him still being miserable...

But I now realize that another way of looking at it is that he spent 40 - 60 grand to find true peace, true stillness. The money he spent, getting the implants, it was all part of the journey. I think he spent the money to get his hearing, but what he got instead was serenity, which is maybe worth a lot more. It is pretty sad. A lot of late-deafened people are never fully comfortable in the hearing world anymore, and the Deaf community is really exclusionary (if you don't 100% drink the kool-aid). It is a scary place to be.

 There is a peace to be found in it though, and most of the hearing world is accepting and accommodating. 

One of the issues the film has with Implants is that it seems to show them as magical, where in reality they have limitations. You need to go into using them with tempered expectations..... whereas our MC doesn't do that. It hit me like Moonlight. A wave of emotion just hit me right after the fade to black. Finally found that stillness There are dozens of us! Don’t forget Drumline That was the new ""it's not your fault scene"" from Good Will Hunting. Brilliantly done. Wait, I must have missed context.  Did he and Lou break up?! Absolutely. It definitely deserves to win considering how crucial the sound design was in telling the story. They combined the Sound categories into one this year. Sadly might hurt this film's chances at winning one but really pulling for a nomination at least 1917?  Maybe Dunkirk? Only ones that come to mind recently Destroyed me. Thank you. That scene is not getting enough love. It’s the first time I could tell Ruben gains an awareness. Extremely underrated scene. Annihilated me. 😭 [deleted] Amen. I couldn't help but feel that this was a horror movie in the first 20 minutes. Glad I pushed through to the end though. I was a bassist for a metal band back in the day and I remember my ears ringing for days after a show and never wanted to wear plugs because I thought they seemed not-metal. Now when i go to shows, I wear them and it feels great to not have my ears ringing as soon as the show is over. I'm really glad I, at least at this point, haven't had any hearing loss. Same man...same. Well at least her brows return to natural by the end. Right???? Why were they white?? Her eyebrows made it looked like she has no eyebrows. Also the sound of the metal bells being hit is what triggered him to take off the implants. It reminded me of the end of Call Me By Your Name, with the camera just holding on the actor's face.  No dialog, just pure, raw expression. I think his reaction to the doctor telling him about the hearing loss was one of the most realistic reactions I've ever seen on film. No over the top breakdown. No walking away and monologuing to Lou about his emotions.  Nope. Just a shell shocked ""ok ok ok"" as he tried to take it all in and make sense of what was happening. Raci should too. Thanks for your insight into this. As a person who is not deaf/Deaf, I had wondered about some of the things you have talked about in this comment - especially potential dilemmas/tensions between identifying as deaf/Deaf, and I had also assumed that there would be rehab associated with the implants, and wondered whether this had been skipped over in the film when conveying how Ruben's changed hearing with it. Part of me was like ""surely there would be an adjustment period, and although his hearing won't be like before, it'll be better than now...""

It felt like there was quite a bit of judgement from Joe towards Ruben, after he got his implants - from my perspective it seemed unfair, as I could empathise with why Ruben made the decision he did, but I didn't know whether this was me not being empathic enough of the Deaf community. Sorry for my ignorance, but what is the difference between deaf and Deaf? I was surprised I hadn't seen him in a movie before, I don't remember his small parts in Scrubs or Parks and Rec and yet he seemed so familiar. Turns out his parents were both deaf and he was an addict. Helps the authenticity. I felt the message of the movie was appreciate what you have, try to live with yourself and be comfortable with who you are.

He takes his brother for granted on that phone call anticipating what his brother will say. He takes his hearing for granted after the doctor tells him he needs to preserve the little hearing he has left. He takes the van for granted, he takes Lou and her family’s money for granted, he takes the program and the people in it for granted, and in the end he loses everything to get back something that isn’t as sweet as he once believed it was (his hearing). He fights so hard against all the change that’s happening to him and it’s after he loses it all that he’s able to sort of surrender to circumstance and accept who he is and what he is and be grateful for that. 

He burned those bridges with the program so I don’t think he’s going to return, I think he learned his personal lesson and he’s back at square one. If I were to guess I’d look to how he came out of rehab as an indication of what happens to him. He never relapsed, he found a new calling, he learned to live with a life long affliction. I like to think whatever he does next, he’s at peace and that’s what’s most important. He goes back the community and falls in love with the teacher.  They get married and have 3 kids.  The middle one is deaf from birth but goes on to become a US Senator. I completely agree re favorite scene. I realized this when Ruben ends up taking out the implants at the end and embracing the silence. 

Joe said he was going to teach him to live with his deafness, not learn how to run from it; Ruben wasn’t ready for that at the time so he had to leave.  I felt like Joe was being harsh at the time and a bit cruel but I got it at the end when he took out the implants and appeared ready to accept it. Foreshadowing isn’t the right term but the scene where Joe tells Rubin to leave is certainly powerful. Probably the best scene in the move, in my opinion.

Close nominees would be the final confrontation with Joe and the end scene, which was just fantastic. >I hope Riz Ahmed is recognized this award season. He’s a wonderfully natural actor.

The guy is [fucking sick on the mic too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIkv4kApZYQ) Couldn't agree more. I felt like this was such a great ending that was extremely realistic. It also was great seeing characters act really human, without the cliche story. In bed they just came to the understanding without having to spell it out. That was such a raw emotional scene that felt so real. I loved the ending. I got into an argument without the significant other about the ending. No cliche happy ending, just real people coming to understanding. Loved it. I mean even before he had the hearing loss he didn't speak French Wow didn’t notice that, but great catch Oh my god... I watched this today and you don’t know how much I needed this bit of hope! It ends on such a bleak note.... I must have missed that subtle sound design. That must be deliberate in a film as beautifully sound designed as this one. I made a similar comment on another thread, but the way I perceived it is that Ruben WAS most likely educated (at least through reading materials) on the risks and possible outcomes, but he most likely failed to read them due to his stubborn idealism about the procedure. He had an idea of how it was gonna go, and he couldn’t be convinced otherwise. > expectations would always be explained to Ruben UPFRONT. He would not be going into the surgery with expectations of perfectly restored hearing unless there was a gross negligence of counseling on the audiologist and surgeon's part.

This is the one scene I think would've been a great add to the movie. Show him being told this won't be the fix he's looking for but he pursues it anyway, otherwise it seemed like he was just sold an expensive surgery and misled This is really insightful. As a casual viewer (who’s played in bands and has mild tinnitus), I’m not sure that additional medical minutiae would have advanced the plot in a meaningful way for me — it’s a tight script covering multiple themes.

And yes, wear hearing protection even when you aren’t sure if you need it. Odds are, you probably do. > Shameless ""plug"": Please wear hearing protection around loud noise.

I wish I had listened to my parents/aunts/uncles when I was younger and starting to go to concerts. I've only started wearing them the last few years and if there's not enough noise I hear continual ringing. At 32 yo I'm paranoid about where I'll be in my 60s. I’m 100+ days late to this movie and discussion but please take my upvote and award. 

I’m currently getting my AuD and shared many of your same thoughts, especially frustration with the complete lack of counseling and aural rehabilitation displayed throughout the film.

There are so many nuances within the Deaf community concerning feelings and responses to HAs/CIs so I was glad to see that the story didn’t take one “correct” side, so to speak. I did start to worry toward the end that the message was shifting more to shaming Ruben for choosing the implants - but I choose to believe that by the end, he was beginning to accept his new life and that will include balancing when to use the CIs and when to remove them to enjoy peace through quiet stillness.

The more I realize the film from the place of addiction and loss, the less annoyed I am by the blatant errors in audiology treatment (i.e. not explaining how hearing via implants greatly improves over time). But I still definitely had that same initial reaction of defensiveness for our field and the care we take to ensure no one ever is under a false impression of unrealistic results. 

All that aside, this is now one of my favorite films and I’m elated to see it nominated for so many Academy Awards.

ETA: I’m also a musician (specialty: hearing conservation for musicians) that played hundreds of gigs in my youth without any sort of hearing protection and am grateful to have the hearing I still do. In my memory, Ruben was never wearing in-ear monitors or plugs of any kind. This still isn’t likely to cause sudden bilateral HL like you said, but I thought it was worth mentioning that he appeared to be playing drums unprotected. So to echo you...

*dear everyone,*

*please wear hearing protection around loud noises.*

*sincerely,
your ears + audiologists everywhere* I got my implant 3 months ago and no dr told me that the sounds would be so terrible, even worse than what’s in the movie. Of course it got so much better with time and I’m grateful for it, I just should’ve be warned lol. What I experienced is apparently standard This guy is spot on in his analysis. The bit about sudden hearing loss especially. Any competent audiologist would have sent him to an oto immediately Someone said it is believed he goes back, there’s children laughing during the end credits, hinting he’s gone back. I can definitely see him returning to the community. He was finally learning how to be deaf at the end of the movie so I imagine he would go back with a new frame of mind. Have you watched The Night Of limited series on HBO? He's excellent in that as well. [removed] Right, but I mean, if you that short on cash and gonna invest all you have on such a procedure, you first check some reviews no? There I always a first. Especially if you found the clinic using a computer. I understand it's different. But, as someone who had pretty bad tinnitus for a few years, it sounded an awful lot like that for me. I always described it as sounding compressed and clipped for certain frequencies and volume levels. https://youtu.be/57WXFrnjzcU

It's real rough. I thought about that too--when >!the woman was like ""Your hearing will never be the same as it was before"" I thought, uhh, wouldn't they have already told him this before the surgery?  But then I thought about how he was so intent on getting the implants he would have never listened to what they were saying or actually made an effort to process it before he had the operation.!< Same. My fiancé and I are former touring rock musicians and we both had skyrocketing anxiety for the whole first 30 minutes.

From reading this sub, I feel like all musicians felt panicky as fuck during this movie. Too real.

Hard and honest reminder to *wear hearing protection around loud noises*. I wouldn't say the community are against fixing deafness, it's just that they can't have people **in that community** who see it as something that should be fixed. This makes sense - I feel like the movie made me understand this challenge much more than I otherwise would have (since I don't know what it's like to be deaf). The implants don't sound good, and it seems like they are only necessary if you want to interact in a world where people don't speak sign language. He could live at peace in the entirely deaf community he was in, but live in a tiny world, or tolerate the annoying sound of the implants to necessitate being able to communicate with people in a non-deaf world which is a lot bigger and potentially has more opportunities in it.

It's basically like, if you live in a world where no one spoke your language, would you withdraw yourself to a smaller community that understands you, cutting off ties to the rest of that world, or would you be willing to tolerate a painful and annoying device that lets you communicate, albeit very slowly with the rest of the world, where you'll still be seen as ""different"" and a bit of an outcast.

This movie does a good job of showing the difference between those two choices. Neither is the wrong one it seems, but it certainly does seem like a compelling thought that the lifestyle you'd consider to be ""no life at all"" is actually a lot better than it might seem at first. Great thoughts, but for me,the roof fixing was really indicative of addict behavior.  In my life, I know a lot of 'fixers' - people who are running from a compulsion and feel uncomfortable so they create a compulsive need to be productive.  I thought the way Joe recognizes that for some addicts, fixing a roof can be a substitute for taking a hit and doesn't address the root problem/encourages the unhealthy thinking pattern was really really profound.  Out of context, ""you don't need to fix anything here"" is a cheesy line,but I think what it communicates about the addict experience is smart and I actually wish the movie went deeper with that philosophy He was good also in ""the night of"" Nice take. I would just emphasise that it was the only time in the movie that he found the ""kingdom of God"", and it wasn't the church, but rather his ability to find stillness, as suggested by Joe. good review man Lauren Ridloff? She is going to be a Deaf superhero in the Eternals Marvel movie being released this summer. I noticed this as well, with the background extras looking as though they were entering his ear and exiting. 

Very good framing (if that’s the right term) of that last shot. After the activation my anxiety went skyrocket, and i felt so afraid and confused, i just did not expect the robotics sounds or ""sounds of metal"" at all. Thank you for your comment, i too was very anxious! > Getting his hearing partially back, doesn't prevent him from teaching deaf kids how to play the drums, nor does it mean he is back to what he used to be, which is obvious.

I don't think the issue was him being unable to teach kids how to play drums. It was about having gone ahead with the procedure. If he had stayed in the deaf community he would've been a constant reminder to everyone about their handicap, which is exactly what Joe didn't want. His presence by itself could've caused pain to the other members of the community. I was late deafened when I was 16, I’m with Ruben, I want my old life back. The deaf community can have amazing people, but living in the hearing world while being deaf is an absolute pain in the ass and I need to fix it. A large part of the deaf community does indeed view it as something that doesn’t need to be fixed and are against cochlear. I don’t get it. I guess when you live deep within the deaf community and are surrounded by deaf people all the time, it’s your own little exclusive bubble, you all understand each other and there are no barriers, it must feel nice, why would you want to fix that, right? I guess that’s their mindset, “You want to fix your deafness? You want to leave our community? You think it’s a bad thing? You’d pay $40,000 just to get rid of it? That feels insulting to us.” I don’t get it, I don’t agree with it, but I’m guessing where it comes from. It doesn’t make sense to you or me, but to them it does. I wasn’t sure if it was a true breakup of their relationship or just their band. He said to her, “it’s ok” and that immediately followed his mentioning that they could start touring again. Then, she got quiet. I took it to mean Ruben accepted that she might not want to continue their band but you definitely can take it both ways. To me, their relationship was toxic, like the bad kind of addictive love where they feel like they NEED each other to live--like at the end when he says ""you saved my life"" and she says ""you saved mine too""--that might have been true but it's not exactly a model for a healthy, sustainable life, where each partner is responsible for their own wellbeing and doesn't rely on the other one for it.  i thought when he left it was a really excellent narrative choice.  like, they can't be together anymore because they rely on each other too much and that exacerbates each of their unhealthy sides, when the truth is, they really just needed to be responsible for themselves to find peace I took it as they were each others addictions.  They saved each other but only way to fully heal was apart. Sad but beautiful. Yeah, a super subtle one was when he made breakfast in the morning early in the film only one plate had the fried egg (presumably his, not hers). Super nice attention to detail on this film. I took it as sort of a trigger for her. She clearly has some mental issues and has battled depression, which I’m guessing stems from her mother’s suicide. Her dad said it was a song that he wrote with her mother (I’m assuming dad was a successful song writer and mom was a singer/performer), and it must be reminding Lou of her mother. Lou doesn't love him anymore, and that matches with the lyric of the song. Ruben was distracting himself from dealing with his addiction and learning to be deaf. He was fixing *Joe's* house when he should have been working on fixing *his* house. As someone who works with those addicted, it felt like a nob to Rueben's addicted mindset-- this can be many things but usually the person is stuck in triangle of victim, rescuer and percuter. It implies that when him and lou were together he was the ""fixer""/resucuer and that and the music made him necessary and needed. Even when she left him in thr cab he tells her he's going to fix it. He implied fixing  again and again.

When he's fixing the roof it seems like he is stuck in this mindset, while also  greiving, and living out this pattern instead of moving towards acceptance. The end implies he finds beauty in stillness and is coming to a place of clarity and acceptance. I’ve been in a similar headspace before and he recognized that Ruben was keeping busy to avoid confronting the position he found himself in. That’s why he wanted him to write so much. He needed to think about what happened and accept it, instead of ignoring it. My understanding is when you lose your hearing as an adult as both Ruben and Joe had your speech is much less affected.  Riz Ahmed wore in ear inserts during filming that made him unable to hear so I assume his speech was as it would be had he actually just gone deaf.  That said, I would guess your volume control would be off and I wonder if he was directed so as to sound more normal and not distract the viewer I mean, he doesn't have a whole lot of competition so I have to imagine he will be nominated. He and Gary Oldman in Mank are pretty secure, I think. I know..I legitimately was annoyed because she seemed so rad in the beginning By far. Same here.  I've had severe hearing loss in both ears from issues stemming from childhood.  I'm currently completely deaf in one ear and slowly losing hearing in my other ear.  I've been told I absolutely should not wear headphones or ear buds and need to do everything I can to protect what little hearing I have left. I can't go out and be at bars, or loud parties or restaurants or anything like that. Subtitles are a way of life.  So is having the volume so loud my neighbors probably hate me.   This was honestly very hard for me to watch.  Fantastic movie and performance by Riz and everyone else but damn during the first scene in the ENTs office getting the hearing test.  Having been in that little booth more times than I can count, with those uncomfortable ass headphones and the walls with all the tiny holes in them, it just brought back a lot of difficult memories and I almost reflexively turned the movie off because it was just too much. Yeah the old Walter whites. Check out Soul on Disney+ if you haven’t. Very similar themes there, as well. I don’t have the time to address it all but I feel as though almost all of these aren’t holes/flaws and make perfect psychological sense. It’s just the film doesn’t hold hands and expects you to walk towards certain explanations, which is interesting, considering that at one point, you claimed that it was telling as opposed to showing? Tbh I actually was happy it didn't turn into a movie all about music -- and I say this as a drummer myself. I think we too often end up getting movies where some sort of passion saves the MC and I just don't think we needed it here. Nor am I dying for another tortured artist film. Having a deep connection to music wasn't really meant to be a focal point here, in my opinion. Although I gotta say, being in an amateur band and touring all on your own is enough to show me how important music is to you because that shit is tough as hell. But yeah, overall it was definitely more a vehicle that transformed into the literal sound of metal, ie the CIs. I'm glad that it simply grappled with his life as a whole. Music is deeply important to me, and it helps me a lot to cope with my depression. But at the end of the day when you're coping with a mental illness, it really is just a blimp in the overall chaos of your mental health -- which is very clear with how quickly he starts selling his gear just to fund the CIs. So I'm glad it stayed in the background but was more of a subtle element throughout the movie, including the ending where listening to his girlfriend singing was really the final kick in the knees for him to realize that the CIs aren't going to fix everything, and certainly not his connection to music. 

But in regards to his girlfriend, I totally agree. I don't know if I was even supposed to sympathize with her, but I overall ended up not liking her very much. I was pretty surprised that when he went back she didn't even seem to have learned a lick of ASL. I learned a bit of ASL just to interact with my coworker, let alone a loved one. And the way she talked about their ""little gypsy"" life made her come off as a truly a bratty rich girl. Maybe if they had fleshed her out more I could have cared more, but her talking that way even after learning about her life solely through the dad's sitdown didn't do much for me. The strong co-dependent vibes of that whole relationship just didn't feel thoroughly fleshed out, and it probably should have been considering that it felt like he was practically addicted to her yet accepted the end of the relationship so well. 

So yeah I think the relationship overall is what knocked it down a few points for me. I stilled loved it, but if that area were stronger it'd be a top film for me. I think the movie tried to tackle a lot of things here, and it did some of those things better than others. I appreciate the ambitiousness, but it, unfortunately, couldn't hit the mark on the many topics it brings up. I am hearing/speaking, the casting out and exclusionary aspects of the deaf culture are what stopped me from studying ASL beyond two years. Personally, I don't like the way the culture(in large) does not accept that technology and scientific advancement can add layers to ones life. I had to wrestle with the debate for years before I landed where I did. But I took implants to be similar to a prosthetic leg or lasik surgery or a gripping hand or any other scientific advancement that allows one creativity and fluidity. Yes. learn sign and communicate but that is not independent. One can also get implants and still communicate via sign. I hated that aspect of deaf culture.       
Like any culture some in the deaf community do not shun but then again many do.      

EDIT: I studied from 2000-2002. Apparently the deaf community has been shifting to acceptance. seems like ppl that learn sign and get CI(implants) are less outcast. You have never dated a rich grrl. Warning there might be spoilers here!

Thanks for the write up. I watched it today and it’s a movie that will stick with me a lot. I’ve seen various documentaries and films about Deaf Culture and so I was expecting some conflict there. The Paul Raci character was phenomenal. He had the right mix of compassion, tough love, and discipline needed for what he was doing to help all those people.

I think maybe what I was left with was just.... sadness at the end. Like, as soon as he lost his hearing, his life changed. Seriously changed. And he was poor and didn’t have any real support to navigate through something traumatic like this. From all sides - hearing friends and family, to true support from his new deaf community.

He made a choice to get the implants and once you do that, there’s no going back. Of course there would never be a miracle where his hearing comes back, but with the implants that’s it. Your natural ears will never work again. And his disappointment with the sound of the implants is so painful to see. I think like many, we expect this massive joy to overwhelm the person getting the implants; we’ve all seen the videos of the babies hearing their mother’s voice for the first time... but in reality it’s not miraculous. Just functional at best. At least that’s how they portrayed it in the movie.

So what happens now? If he was at heart a musician (which as you mentioned was not well established), can he continue? Probably not. (Although insert joke about noise metal here. ha.) The end is left totally open. Will he continue to use the implants? Is he giving up on life? What’s he going to do now??

In the end I was very moved by this but not in a normal way. Just a supremely thought provoking movie (especially for a musician myself - thinking, “what would I do?”). What more can you ask of a movie though? I appreciate that at least. I think the audience is supposed to join the dots. I don't know if these characters are supposed to be realistic or more symbolic. Support versus selfishness seemed to be the thematic quality of the film.

The girlfriend abandoning him I think just symbolises how the world in general abandons him or he feels a sense abandonment. She's a personification of that. 

The community being absolute in their belief of not reversing deafness waa a little weird to me.

Great write up by the way. I think it's a matter of what information he was willing to actually listen to. In the first scene with a doctor he ignores the instructions around following up and running more tests. He wanted a quick fix to solve his problem.

I think it's very in line with his outlook and approach to life too. I think that scene were hes told that he doesn't have to fix things around the house, and him not understanding why, is indicitave of that same mentality. I think the way I saw it, it makes sense because even if the film did show the doctors explaining everything (not sure this makes sense from a cinema POV, would've been bland exposition), he would've just glossed over it anyway because as Paul Raci's character tries to tell him, it's that stillness and the quiet that will never leave a man. Ruben's always focused on the wrong things, which is in part because of his addiction.

Even if the film did show those scenes, I don't think Ruben's reaction would've been any different. Him selling his RV is pretty desperate. Good point. I am hearing impaired (but not fully deaf) and explored the possibility of cochlear implants at one point. During my first consultation, it was explained to me that the implants aren’t an instant “fix”....that you must essentially relearn how to hear again and process sounds. Your brain has to adjust. The film could have done a better job of explaining that. To those who aren’t familiar, the process might be a bit confusing. Earplugs! Stadium seating! Not as good as getting in the mosh but boy howdy its pretty close :) yeah i have tinnitus. double whammy with this film because there are plenty of dead silent parts to let the tinnitus ring thru. I got ya!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0toHWCiOTQ During the deaf cult I was thinking similarly, good but not amazing, and was a bit of a drag. Picked up when he gets the implants and then it got a lot better for me. Nowhere near Parasite though. I don't think it's Best Picture material but Riz Ahmed *has* to win Best Actor > but does anyone feel like this movie wasn’t as good as the hype

found your reason why, don't watch movies because you feel like you have to, it's better if you were interested in them I just watched this movie and I agree with you. There were some good things about the film, like the sound editing, Riz Ahemd's/ Raci's overall performances, and the portrayal of the deaf community and its controversies over cochlear implants, but overall, I felt the movie was reaching for something and didn't quite get there.

It was the type of movie where you are dropped into a situation and you had to connect the dots in a much-less supported way than other wonderful films. For example, I'm not sure why they had him go to a rehab facility when he had been clean 4 years and did not seem to be using or on the verge of using again. Now, it's true in real life, stress can cause someone to fall back into old negative patterns but that was an assumption I had to make and not one the movie showed or even really hinted at. Another example is when Lou left: it wasn't clear where she was going, why, etc. If her relationship with him was so close, why'd she leave so abruptly? Then why did he turn up all of a sudden at her home? 

Like you, I really enjoy movies and watch the whole gamut. What I've found over time is that writing really matters to me: if the plot lines aren't clear, then that significantly diminishes the film, even though I've enjoyed movies where I know the plot is formulaic and  I watch because of a specific actor or for the cinematography. I often find that movies/ TV shows that are popular/ hyped, I don't find that original or thrilling. Most recently, I watched 2 episodes of ""The Queen's Gambit"" and gave up. I was also not impressed by the films Roma (except for its cinematography), The Irishmen, A Star is Born, Call Me By Your Name, etc. Different strokes for different folks!

If you enjoyed Parasite, check out that director's earlier movie ""Mother."" (no, not the one with Jennifer Lawrence) I saw it years before Parasite and was thrilled by it.  One thing I really miss - and I'm dating myself here - are IMDB's original movie discussion boards. Occasionally, I find myself watching movies from decades ago (made way before I was born): with less cash and flash, the plots are much tighter. Some of my all-time faves are Fritz Lang's ""M"" , 'The Visit"" with Ingrid Bergman, ""D.O.A."",  ""Double Indemnity"", 'Rope"", ""The Bicycle Thief"", ""Le Samourai."" I feel like the movie really lost momentum around the second half started when Ruben suddenly decides to get the implants. Like as it was playing out; it felt like the movie was punishing Ruben for not sticking with the Deaf Community and that he was bound to fuck up because he was a former addict riding off the emotion alone. The fact he was a musician didn't seem to matter in the grand scheme of things. 

So much about what I respect about the film is technical. The editing, the sound design/editing/mixing, the naturalist direction, Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci being fantastic. But the plot feels very...hallow and misleading to a degree. In parasite you feel the game is played by the director ( cinematography). In Sound of metal, the weight came from the character (Ruben), he took us deep into what it feels like to lose hearing. The emotional impact left by Sound of metal was way too strong for me than parasite ( that i enjoyed esthetically) I mean he didn’t entirely blow his chance at a new path, I would imagine just like AA, the community doesn’t cut you off for eternity just because you strayed from their path. I imagine that through hard work and understanding Ruben would be able to come back to the community with open arms if that’s what he chooses. I recover by reading official discussion threads on reddit. Only a few films I do this with and thats purely because they're masterpieces. What a film. It’s not accurate at all. The very first day might sound a bit like what he experienced, but many times the brain fills in the gaps and you get semi normal sound. In fact, sometimes you get very normal sound if you still had partial hearing before the surgery. This was one fault I had with the movie; it didn't feel nuanced at all about its politics with cochlear implants. imo it's really fucked up that a large part of the deaf community will shun people for getting them. And the fact the doctor/surgeon didn't sign to him after the surgery was pretty bullshit, there's no way they wouldn't know ASL. Felt like they were subtlety pushing that what she was doing wasn't helping people. > am I missing something? Is he on a show that I just don't watch? 

Yes, one of his best performances was on The Night of, the HBO mini-series where he and John Turturro are the main actors. He actually won an Emmy for his performance so you should definitely check it out, its a great watch. I do not know how you can watch this movie and walk away with ""Riz Ahmed is performative and not that good of an actor."" That's a really weird take to have on what he does in this movie lmao. Most of this review is just your critiques that you would behave differently in a circumstance that's pretty unusual and traumatic?? You can score the movie however you like, but personally, leading with what you would have done in the main character's situation discredits most of your opinion. Tenet is shit compared to this one. When implants first came out, there was a period where the community was very anti-implant (1990's - 2000's). In the past 10 years there has been a major opinion shift. Most Deaf people are accepting of deaf people with implants, and the prevailing philosophy for deaf children is ""do both"" i.e. an implant (for a spoken language) and also a sign language. 

Only stubborn Deaf militants and older Deaf folks are still anti-implant. It's a reputation we have that we're trying to get rid of, but the belief we're all like that is still super common unfortunately. Yes, but its a complicated issue. I'm not deaf but I had a friend who was and got cochlear implants. They're still very polarizing in the community and I still hesitate to say I understand why or why not because it's simply something I've never had to live through and I don't know what it's like to be hearing impaired on that level. In the context of the film, I assume the community wouldn't actively shun Ruben for getting the implant, but his presence alone would hinder the whole operation. Imagine if someone just like Ruben arrived for his first day there and saw Ruben in the process of getting his implant. The new guy would never buy in to what the deaf community is trying to teach. And also like Joe said, Ruben would just be a walking reminder to everyone that they can't hear when that particular commune is supposed to be a safe space for them.

As for IRL, ""shun"" sounds like a strong word but then again I have no clue lol There was supposed to be subtitles? I feel like the bits you don’t quite understand add to the sense of what it must be like for those with hearing loss at first, constantly battling to work out what was said or what somebody means, and in a way makes the film that much more immersive. she has a history of self harm and also dermatillomania  (aka ""excoriation disorder"" to console herself (often a result of anxiety), I have had issues with dermatillomania so I recognized it right away - it can manifest as scratching of skin/scalp, picking at certain things like nails compulsively etc. I don't think it's her ""addict"" side coming out, though it's definitely a compulsive habit often used to self-soothe it is unrelated to drug-use (clarification: not always, but in this case I believe it is unrelated). so I interpreted that to mean that her life on the road was causing anxiety (she was still scratching at that time), and she was doing much better in France because she hadn't been scratching...so her old life coming back through Rubi was almost instantaneously causing anxiety (not to mention the massive changes they had just endured). just wanted to add another perspective.

&#x200B;

I 100% don't think she started using, she was much healthier and doing better...he's saying ""it's okay,"" because he realizes that she doesn't want to continue their relationship and go back to their old life but doesn't have the heart to say it because she loves him so much - he sees her anxiety and has the mature realization that he needs to let her go for her own wellbeing, even though he still loves her and probably feels like he needs her...it's the most mature radical decision he makes in the movie, he is accepting the situation and taking responsibility for his own life, and recognizing that their paths have diverged...it's a really beautiful, painful moment. He said “ no scratches?” meaning she’s kinda “cured” of her depression and self hate. Remember the scene earlier when the father was thanking Ruben that he’s daughter use to hate him after her mother committed suicide but that she doesn’t hate him anymore. 

When he said “it’s ok, Lou” he was reassuring her that it’s ok that she wants to move on from what they had. When he sees her earlier that day he mentions to her that she has stopped scratching after not seeing him for months. I saw that in the beginning of the movie and thought it was self harm but it's just her addict side shining through. He realizes two things in bed with her. That she doesn't want to go back to the life they had. And that he is stressing her out and bringing her closer to using. That's the way I took it. That song was such a bummer. Why would anyone sing that with their daughter, about his marriage, and think it would go smoothly with a party crowd? The father said he would often write music for Lou’s mother and that this was one of those songs. He doesn’t do something at the commune that destroys everyone’s positive perception of him. He doesn’t fuck any of his newfound friends over or steal money from them. I get so stressed at shit like this lol. Between this and ""Yes God Yes"", I've had enough sneaking computer scenes for 1 year lol. I thought for sure the last scene was going to be him returning to the teacher. She was side eyeing him the whole movie like wtf nothing happened??? TFW the real mindfuck is a human story without any saucy twists. But actually, what a beautiful movie. I’m not trying to be flippant here, but how would your family member know if the sound was accurate or not if their hearing relies on an implant? Wouldn’t they hear an even more distorted, low fidelity version than someone without hearing problems? hngggggg oh my god im an idiot. thank you for that Probably the last shot of that scene, when the camera panned out How’s the implant? like Joe said, the worlds a cruel place but that bit of peace will always be there for you to come back to God I thought that was gonna happen too, and I was annoyed thinking the movie was gonna go there. Like a worse movie would have. She did, you can see Ruben sneak. Into the office to read her emails and write back The bells at the end as well. The last thing he hears. Playing that song during the last shot would have been so on the nose. Haha. Glad they didn’t. Or the sound of music I disagree. From an Audiologists standpoint, it was bad. They did a huge disservice to how the implants actually sound. They didn’t go in to any detail about how the implants have to be adjusted after activation. The initial hearing test and diagnosis left a lot of detail out.

Also, most insurances cover the implants. That was infuriating to hear. They definitely do. I was chatting up some chick from OKC and she said she worked with deaf community. So I thought she would love to hear about implants (which I find fascinating from a technological stand point)

Nope His performance in The Night Of was absolutely devastating. He's had a great track record of working on these raw, realistic, emotionally wrenching projects that demand the kind of restraint he brings to his acting to really make it work. Not gonna lie, I was very into the trailer almost strictly based on seeing the Rudimentary Peni shirt in it. Then GISM streams a concert onto the internet. 2020, it just doesn't stop Like he briefly told his sponsor on the phone in the diner “serenity happens once you stop trying to change the past”. He was in what we call in recovery “self-will run riot”. Recovery from addiction is about surrendering our will and accepting what we cannot change. The first part of the serenity prayer goes “god grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change”. Instead of accepting what he couldn’t change he went to drastic measures to try to change it (i.e selling his RV/home) Which makes that final scene where he takes off his hearing aid so powerful. That was one of the best final shots I've seen in a while. As someone that struggles with addiction, this movie hits so close to home.  One of the best depictions I have ever seen of both recovery and addict tendencies.  Try and tell me it isn't a disease, when the main character just feeds into those same feelings, no matter the source.  Always looking for a way out, or the best solution, not realizing what you're losing in the process.

My girl always has questions about my past.  When Joe asked him to just sit in a room and write, she paused to ask why he would ask him to do that.  I nearly quoted one of those AA catchphrases, but I just said that there is nothing more terrifying to an addict than being alone with their thoughts.  Being able to sit and process your thoughts and conquer your anxiety is true bliss to so many addicts. I was in the same boat, but from having a mother that went through treatment for alcoholism so many times, it really is either one or the whole crew. If one person receives such special treatment, its such a slippery slope. And especially with the deafness angle, it actively went against the principal of the entire commune. It would be like having someone in a rehab center that not only believed, but was allowed to, drink once or twice a month. The ripple effect could ruin everyone That’s the first scene from a movie this year and that I was actually touched by the acting. Not to say Trial of the Chicago 7 or Emma. or anything didn’t have good moments, but I think that was easily the best performance I’ve seen from a 2020 film I’m assuming normally a doctor would’ve told him that beforehand and it was just more interesting for the story to leave it for him to learn that later The naked lady was a tattoo on that girl's back left shoulder. I didn't know why Ruben held the drawing up against her back, but later, when she is loading something of his into her vehicle, you can see the tattoo of the naked lady there. That's when I finally understood why they were working on a drawing of a naked lady together to begin with lol Don’t think so, the naked lady had short hair I agree. I actually thought all the performances were really distant to be honest. It was as if all the characters were there for a costume party instead of really inhabiting their roles. 

I don’t blame the actors though. The story was way too scatter shot when it could have really used more focus on one plot line instead of trying to tell three different stories in the same movie. Agreed. I enjoy “movies about the movies” and had high hopes for Mank. I found it really confusing – I had to keep pausing to get more context around what was happening – and quite boring. I didn’t care about Mank the person at all. It was one of the worst movies I’ve watched this year.

Oldman is a great actor but I’ll be upset if he is recognized over Ahmed. His role does have those posthumous Ledger vibes about it. I think both are true.  I think what you said was absolutely the point the scene was making but I also think the other person is probably right that the writers put that wording in there on purpose I bet. [deleted] Oh wow sorry to hear that. Did you go the implant route? Poetically, maybe, but in reality, I would be devastated in that position. Doesn't the film show that the implants are heavily flawed? I don't think Ruben will ever be able to properly hear an environment with plenty of background noise and chatter (like a party) ever again. And Step Brothers... I took the scene at the end as both of them moving on. Ruben tells Lou “it’s okay” and that “she saved his life,” then leaves from the apartment before anyone is up the next morning. It also seems like they were much different people by the end of the film. I guess maybe it is kind of open ended but I interpreted it as both of them accepting their new lives. Yes.  He specifically went out of his way to complement her on no new scratches meaning she hadn't self-harmed during his absence.  As soon as he brought up starting up the tour/album again, she began picking at her arm which he recognized and he realized that they were over.  It was beautifully done. Ford V Ferrari be a good example recently as well I would really recommend checking out an ENT and Audiologist doctor. 

Hearing aid tech has come along way; they are programmed for your explicit hearing loss, not ""one size fits all"" devices. They are also semi-covered by most insurances nowadays, in addition to being pretty small and sometimes little perks like bluetooth connectivity (phones, etc). She had bleached them when he bleached his hair. I thought it was a nice juxtaposition to when they met in the end and he had cut his hair and she no longer had her eyebrows died. One less thing they had in common and visually communicated that. She was using his leftover dye Yes! Very good reminder of that. Also, thinking abut it now, *Portrait of a Lady on Fire*, which really floored me earlier this year. Different scenario, but when I surprisingly got diagnosed with testicular cancer at 17, this is basically how it went. Admittedly though, i did have the dramatic scene of, when the details started getting laid out, I said I had to go to the bathroom and had a panic attack that led to me getting lost in the small clinic and barely finding the bathroom before bursting into tears. But yeah, I never once thought about getting mad at the doctor or completely walking out, then again I knew my mother was in the office listening to him so I was able to leave for the rest of it without fear of missing info. Honestly was more impressed with him than Riz. His little huff at the end of their talk where he was letting out everything he had pent up during that talk was moving. Good question and I’ll answer it how I understand it.   I’m deaf, which means I need help with my hearing.   Started off with hearing aids and ramped up to a Cochlear.  I’m still fully engrained, can work and participate in society.

Deaf pertains to folks who are completely deaf and/or living as part of the Deaf community.  Ruben will always be deaf, but will he go back to being in the Deaf community and become a Deaf person???  

Hope that helps (again, my interpretation of the difference) That actor did an excellent job. Very well done. 

His moment of stillness at the end was amazing. 

His acting in the beginning was spot on too. I know that guy that he was playing. It was perfect. The scene with Joe was fantastic. Ruben basically explains the entire theme of the movie—things happen, people change, life moves on—but he clearly doesn’t understand that yet because he’s trying to reclaim his old life before his hearing went away. Or maybe he understands deep down but he’s angry about it and doesn’t want to admit it. Sure, but it was like he was having difficulty hearing any particular person due to the limits of the implant.  He just kind of ended up standing off by himself.  The implant seemed almost useless to him in that setting. I could see that happening. Good take I’m late to the party but 100% this. I kept saying at the beginning when Ruben is going “it’s that simple it’s that easy” that it definitely was not and that he was just jumping ahead to the solution before really looking into it Jeez I'm so sorry to hear that. Like I said, I believe it is a significant failure on the doctors' part that they didn't make sure you were well-informed. No always put that off. Is it worth it? I’m implanted too it mine was worse than the movie depicted for a good few months until it got a lot better. I thought they did a great job at showing how realistic it was, at least in my experience. I have friends who had it worse than I did too. So I don’t think it’s a dramatized thing that implants sound bad lol, they do to tons of people for a long time until it starts to sound better! u/shsgdgsgash I'm glad to hear that. You're the first person I've heard of who says that the implants actually sound like normal sounds.  I'm much more relieved now. His character was just very desperate and refused to accept his new life. Even Joe asked Ruben in their final conversation if he had ever just sat still in that study room.

Not hearing nor health related, but I've been in a situation where I wanted things to be back to ""normal"" so badly, I went to the extreme to fix the situation when in reality I should have just accepted my ""new"" normal. The film is big on Ruben being in denial for the majority of the movie, damn near until the final 5 mins. He seemed impulsive to me like he wouldn’t have cared what the reviews were. Like the doctor told him he had to stop drumming and follow up for more tests, instead he performed some more and didn’t. He didn’t even research what it would be like to have them or check in with her before he sold everything and went to Paris. well thats depressing. Yeah even that first doc was like “we got to do everything we can to save the hearing you’ve got left” Yeah, it’s different between communities. That community was all about embracing deafness and each other. “Hey look, Kids! Ruben is back! He just spent $30.000 to fix his deafness, he wanted out of it that badly.”  Not a good lesson. I don’t agree with it though. Being deaf is a pain in the ass and is very limiting in the hearing world. I guess that was the goal of the community, only being surrounded by other deaf people to remove all barriers. This. This is why Joe tasked him with just sitting in a room by himself, without doing anything, besides writing (if needed). I agree that this could've been communicated without the line ""you don't need to fix anything here"" because that threw me off at first too. Holy fucking shit I just realized why the movie is called sound of metal That's why I said, I understand the situation. I understand that going with the procedure makes him different than the rest. But it's a very important choice.. Giving him the ultimatum ""You either stay full deaf or you leave and never talk to us again"" is such an asshole move. 

It really felt like there was misguided empathy. Joe was kind to him in the process to ""accept his deafness"" but not in the process of re-connecting with his older life. Of course his girlfriend will lose the connection with him if he can't even communicate with her consistently.. And that's because doing that was prohibited for some reason. 

I'm not saying he should've returned to his older life, it's clear things have changed and I find it perfect he realizes that in the end. I just didn't like the way he was treated in the community, by Joe. If his speech about him losing his family because of alcohol, was true.. Then he has no right to hold back Ruben and force him into deafness. Nor is he ever returning to full hearing, anyway.. He only has the ability to slightly hear in calm environments and only if he's wearing the hearing aid. 

In any case, Ruben lost his girlfriend because Joe prohibited any chance for him to even contact her.

I get the line of ""You sound like an addict"" with the whole money situation, because he was. But he never relapsed back into drugs.. He had been high on life for 4 years now, ever since he met Lou. He wasn't going to start doing shit to himself and ruin his relationships. He just needed to figure shit out, which he does.. Only it's too late to keep his relationship, by then. He's just thrown into a situation where no one is there to truly support his ideals.. To support the process of figuring out his next step, the way he wanted to. It's very sad. I think when she stopped the sex that was about to happen by drinking the glass of water....that's when the relationship was over. I have a different perspective. I don’t think she fell out of love with him. I think she just moved on from that life and realized that it was source of her unhappiness or at least a contributing factor. She was willing to give up that new found happiness at least for that moment because she does still love him. Giving up happiness to be someone is love, even if it’s toxic. That’s what makes that scene so powerful and heartbreaking. Acknowledging that they saved each other’s lives and knowing that they can no longer be apart of them. I thought it was because in their community, deafness isn't something to fix, and Joe was trying to get rid of Ruben's need to try to fix things. Thank you for this write up. Very eye opening and makes a lot of sense. That scene happens the next morning after Ruben snuck on the computer and I thought that’s what Paul Raci’s character was going to be talking about. But instead, it was about not fixing things and finding peace. So good. I was thinking exactly that! You may or may not end up at the destination you thought you wanted, but you might as well try to appreciate the little things along the way cuz you were on the journey regardless... I think is kind of the message from both that I really liked (maybe moreso in ""Soul"" lol). These were things that prevented me from loving it as opposed to just liking it. Many people don't care for these details, some might, hence why I wrote the detailed post to see if people would have an input on some of these things.

What was your point in responding to this other than the classical ""you're wrong I'm right""? You say don't have time to address all of these but you took the time to write how these make perfect sense to you, hm. It's not that you don't have time, but that you can't come up with any counterarguments.

The film doesn't hold hands or expect you to walk toward certain explanations? That's exactly what it does with the most important theme.>! Ruben is told he is behaving like an addict because he got the implants and then shunned. His girlfriend betrays him in the most cowardly way so he could learn that the ""Kingdom of God is in the silence"". It lays it thick in the message that he should have stayed in the community, not turn to medicine or try to go back to how it was. He didn't so he ended up alone and outcast. But when he finally embraced his situation and took off the implants, he found peace. It's not subtle, at all. The ending could also be about the bigger picture, about the fact that no matter your circumstances you can always find solace in meditation which leads to inner peace but it's harder to accept this conclusion considering the rest of the journey.!<

And precisely because it relies so heavily on the audio effects and the final message, it just doesn't bother with some parts of the story. Yes, the commune while seemingly noble, felt too close to a cult. Indeed I have not. I didn't have a problem with them portraying the girlfriend as not being supportive but I did hear a lot of people talking about her as a sympathetic character. I do sympathize with the fact that her previous experience led to self-harm but the way she treated him was abhorent so I don't find her overall, sympathetic. And it kind of felt like the film intended to make us feel sorry for her and that's what bugs me. But maybe this isn't true and I just took it that way. Concert/hi fidelity earplugs. They don't muffle the sound like the disposable foam ones. Seriously. I have tinnitus as well and the moments where I was forced to focus on my own ringing was terrifying. I also have a problem with my ears getting clogged (an infrequent event, but one that renders me temporarily deaf), so the moment when his hearing first gives out and he was only able to hear the muffled sound of touching his own ears was too real for me. I hurt my hands clenching my fists too tightly. It was a visceral reaction that few movies have ever caused me. It’s not a cult? It’s a supportive home? Him getting the implants was one of the most important parts of the movie I really hope so! I loved the scenes where he was genuinely having fun with the kids and people in the program. If he chooses to come back, I hope Joe would gladly welcome him. What world are you living in? That's how they sound, and I've never had one single audiologist who knew sign language. [deleted] There were only subtitles once Ruben could understand what the other people were signing. As the viewer, you got to go along on the learning journey with Ruben. It was brilliant That scene made me laugh tbh, it was too obvious and too cartoonish. I wish it was a happy song and less on your face about ""we are dying it is over forever everything sucks"". If it was a happy song he would feel even more left out since he cant enjoy it. and it would be more effective imo. >He doesn’t do something at the commune that destroys everyone’s positive perception of him

Tbf this one is more subverted by Paul Raci's character because he tells him he doesn't want to damage the harmony he's worked so hard to create in the group by revealing to everyone that Ruben had the operation. He tells him just to leave as that would be best. 

Although that scene between Raci and Ahmed in itself is a subversion because even though neither of them were shouting, it felt like a really low-key version of a argument but it hurt ten times more because of how both people were holding so much back. He doesn't ""learn the error of his ways"" and go back to ask Joe's forgiveness and live on the commune. Late to the party, but just watched this last night and was looking through old posts.

As someone with the implant, I can tell you that the sound was accurate to how the initial hearing worked when you get implanted.   The party and walking down the street at the end were very realistic in that your head is so busy hearing every sound.   Your brain eventually filters that stuff out. i was thinking the same thing haha A follow up on my other response. 

If you have bad vision, you can’t tell if that picture is blurry or not.   But if you had bad vision, and put on your glasses, now you can tell. 

I can tell you the sound was accurate, cause now I can hear.   Hope that helps. Agree 100% lol the way that Lou’s dad was acting when Ruben showed up was just weird to me That and Reuben banging the hot teacher would have brought this movie down from a 9/10 to a 5/10 run of the mill Oscar bait. I'm so dumb. I know he was sneaking on the computer but didn't realise it was that. I was fixated on the one where he watched the video Oh yeah it would’ve ruined the last shot for sure haha great film! Thanks for your reply! I was wondering if the implants really sound that bad, bc the bad sound didn't come up, when I had a discussion with a deaf person with these implants.
I was participating in an 8hour ""crash course"" in sign language and the trainer there was talking about the deaf community and their view of the implants, hence my comment Man, I guess I have pent up anger at ignorant audiologists but too many of you guys sell this shit without ever having personally tried it.  How about you get a CI then if the sound is so good?

And why would Ruben have insurance? Your statement clearly shouts for $$$$$. He finally felt like he could just sit. Yeah, that was one of my issues, that experience shouldn't have been a surprise. I think folks with implants have to go through a ton of training to learn how to hear again.  I guess the rationale for the movie is that it wouldn't have mattered, he made up his mind that this would work and didn't bother to weigh the pros and cons. I thought this, too, but also consider the fact that Ruben had an idealized understanding of what the implants meant. From day one of being told about them, his mind was already made up. He had this perception of a “fix” built in his mind, and he wasn’t going to be convinced that it would go any way but how he pictured it. 

I’m sure that, like any responsible physician, the doctor provided education on the procedure and outcomes, including risks and appropriate expectation-setting. Ruben, however, comes off as someone who thinks it’s a “cure,” and thus doesn’t care about the details. He stubbornly, single-mindedly marches toward it without considering it may not return his hearing completely to normal. He convinced himself of an outcome that could never be, and so he was disappointed to find something that fell short of that outcome. The docs don’t tell you!!! I got my implant 3 months ago. It’s a lot harder than what is shown in the movie and it sounds a ton worse as well (at first) but I think they really did a good job at honestly showing how terrible they are at first compared to all the feel good videos all over the internet saying implants heal you. It isn’t true!! Nah, that entire conversation of Ruben drawing the naked lady was the two of them figuring out what tattoo she wants. Then after a timeskip of a while, she has the tattoo. Yes I just got mine 3 months ago!! Because you think like him. If you went deaf today you would try to fix it. Repair it. But Ruben learned something no money can buy. Implants on day 1 are not how implants work or sound long-term. Most people take atleast 1 year to fully adapt to them, if not longer.

Sound becomes much-much-much better once you are more adapted. It just doesn't make as dramatic of an ending for the movie to show/explain that.

edit: It's very similar to an artificial hip/etc. Would you expect someone to be at 100% peak performance day 1 after surgery? or even after 1 month? I interpreted it this way as well, although it did feel like more Ruben’s choice than Lou’s since he quietly crept out but I think the case could be made either way That hadn’t even crossed my mind, but it does make a lot of sense. I had just felt that last scene was just more his routine of being up really early [deleted] Yes, I said that to my wife after the movie.  There were a few things similar in the movie that under the wrong direction could have felt like they were beating you over the head with it, but they didn't.  His moment of clarity that Joe wanted him to find writing at the end when he removed his implants, the break up, the asking Joe for money scene.  All of it was executed to perfection and otherwise could have been a mess. The one that bothered me in the movie was that they didn’t cut his hair when they did the operation. I understand they wanted the scene of him cutting his hair but it just pulled me out of it One of the most powerful moments in the movie for me. The jarring sounds of the implants was also symbolic of how the way he wouldn’t fit in with Lou’s life anymore. If he didn’t have implants I think the scene would have played out the same. As soon as he suggested going back to their old life Lou immediately got anxious. That’s when it really hit him. Absolutely. Riz and John Turturro are worth the price of admission alone. Probably one of the greatest pilots I've ever seen too. the first episode is maybe the best single television episode of all time. as the series goes on it gets substantially worse but it's still probably worth a watch. They don’t sounds like normal sound, your brain just adapts and it sounds normal to you. I am an implant recipient. I went dead at 12. It isn’t the same at all it’s a whole new way of hearing that your brain adapts to over time Right. The movie was honestly about more than just a man going deaf.

It was watching a man going through life-altering trauma, having a page of your book just turned on you without asking for it.

I'm sure plenty of people with perfectly good hearing could relate to Ruben. Apparently the more hearing you have left when you get implants, the more normal the sound is. And Ruben then plays his show that night. It’s both. But he isnt told he is behaving like an addict because he got the implants? It is because of his obsession of going back to a life that no longer existed, asking for money knowing he was breaking the rules and insulting the deaf community in the process, he was destructive=like an addict. His girlfriend didnt abandon him, she knew she was dealing with an addict and she was suicidal herself so she did what was best for both. The message wasnt ""he should stay in the community"", it was ""he must learn his previous life is over and find a new one"". He didnt end up alone and an outcast, in that final scene he gets his quiet moment, something he was supposed to be looking for the whole time (but didnt, because he was obsessed with going to the past). He wasnt left alone, he was finally full: he realised the healthy way was to look for a new future and stop forcing things. He is now a new man against his will, but is ready for a new start. It is a positive ending that also solves the final argument with the deaf man. The only way he would go to the deaf commune was if she wasn't there. He wasn't going to leave her, he was so focused on ""fixing"". She had to leave. Definitely feels harsh, but it came across to me at least as something she did because it was her only option. Lmao this comment made me laugh I feel it was sort of logically implied that they did; the movie skips over all his setting up appointments and jumps into him confirming the appointment. We see throughout the entire movie that Ruben is super stubborn and, for lack of a better expression, only hears what he wants to hear. He makes a plan and ignores all possible downsides. Like Joe says, he acts like an addict. Man that scene was heartbreaking. Yep, Ahmed was clearly hurt as he had grown find of the community, and Reci hurt as he had grown find of Ahmed. he had tears in his eyes at Ahmed left. Beautiful [deleted] Much much later to the party, but would you say then that when your brain fully adapts, it is quite good? Or is it like a mixed bag? Just curious, its interesting how someone might experience sound so differently. Says the audiologist who has never worn implants lol. Believe what the people who wear them say. Audiologists sell these devices, of course they're not gonna trash them. The deaf culture thing is weird as hell to me. Being deaf isn’t a superpower. It is definitely a handicap and can be fixed. But cool, just shit on people looking to help out Oh shit Stillness Boom. There is is. “That’s life. It just fucking passes.” Made it all the more powerful, that shot of everyone in the background passing him by, in that final moment where he found that “stillness.” I just read your comment as I finished the movie and it made me tear up again. Yeah it was always more about the addiction side of it, him haphazardly selling his RV kinda communicates that Ruben wasnt really thinking that far ahead Nope! We don’t get any training and you aren’t told how terrible it is at first. I’m 23 and went deaf at 12, got the implant in september. What happened to him is exactly what it’s like in real life!! Except even worse when you first get it turned on. All it sounds like is beeps and that’s IT. I’m on month 3 of cochlear implant and it was so bad at first that I just cried for a whole month until things just clicked and my brain started hearing crazy better. The audiologist told me this is why they don’t tell patients how bad it is at first because they know it’ll get better and it’ll be worth it. Still sucks and I wish they would have been honest. I feel like that was something left either in the script or the cutting room floor. Even if they told Ruben, he wouldn't have cared, he would have disregarded it and continued to strive for his old life. The surprise probably has a bigger dramatic impact though Yeah, really clever parallels with the addiction ""backdrop"". He also mentions to Lou how easy things will be once he gets the surgery. Turns out he was behaving like an addict long before Joe pointed it out. That's a really interesting point. Are then any audio clips online that simulate what an implant would sound like initially and then a year or so later? It felt like Lou was putting on a little bit of an act around him, she wasn’t expecting to see him and there was a little bit of awkwardness there, she looks a lot healthier than she did when she left, which indicated to me her life was a lot different now. The awkwardness was also apparent in the scene where they’re in bed kissing, he seems to want to go further but she’s hesitant, reaches for the water, Ruben can tell by her body language that she’s detached and then says “it’s okay” like he’s accepting that they’re not the same anymore, he points out that her arms look better and then she starts scratching which seems to indicate she anxious and uncomfortable, so he realizes their time is up and leaves early the next morning, and finds that stillness. The ""Trainspotting Exit"" They definitely split up. Her grabbing for a drink of water as they’re kissing just to stop it was such a heartbreaking moment. Wake up early, pack all his belongings and leave the house without telling anyone. They broke up for sure. I don't know if the perspective matters, but I was there about 6 years ago. I thought I got along OK without them, but I figured yolo once I realized insurance was mostly going to cover it.

I had forgotten *how much* I wasn't hearing anymore. So many things made noise, and I'd simply completely forgotten. 

The turning signal in the car was one of the more immediately surprising. I got why people used to get annoyed when it didn't click off (when a turn wasn't sharp enough).... that sound was annoying AF, but I hadn't probably actually heard it in 10 years. that pilot. so incredible. best episode of tv ever. Yeah. She was clearly in the right. It was abundantly clear that she wanted to stay but knew she couldn't. One of the most powerful scenes from the film. Another one of my favorites would be the simple but impactful piano scene (where Ruben, the teacher, and the kids were listening through the vibrations). I think it implies that. Joe pretty much said you aren’t welcome here anymore, period. He didn’t say something like get rid of those implants and you can come back. For me, yes, the brain fully adapted and my hearing is great and natural.

I went from 35% word recognition before going cochlear, now I’m over 95%.    I’m lucky in that I still have some natural hearing left so that helps my hearing sound more normal than if I was completely deaf.

I didn’t like how the movie ended.   I liken it to a guy having knee surgery… then after struggling for a week in rehab is like “yeah, I’m just going to use a wheelchair for the rest of my life.” sounds like something someone ableist would say! I agree, but all they had to do was drop in a line ""As we told you before...""  to make it believable that he was told but simply ignored the warning. I’m so glad that it’s gotten better! Did your brain adjust because it suppose to, or did you just get use to the weird sounds? Would you have not gotten it if you knew how it would turn out? Afaik, no there isn't. There's some clips online of supposedly what an implant sounds like, but they are old recordings from the 80's and not indicative of the modern tech.

I don't think it's something you really can have a recording of to show hearing people what it sounds like, as there's no way to verify. The only people that get the implant already have damaged hearing and the implant cause some damage to the remaining hearing they have, so they can't really do a proper ABBA test to verify what it sounds like for hearing and implanted people. It’s the brain getting used to it, the same way it gets used to strong smells after a while (they “disappear”) What finally made him realize was the scratching. It's built up as her sort of self harm that she does without thinking presumably when she isn't in a good mindset. He's aware of it and likely spent a lot of time stopping her from scratching before going deaf. When he first sees her again he remarks how she hasn't been scratching. Then when he starts talking about going back and getting the tour and rv and getting back into their lifestyle, she starts scratching which is when he comes to his realization. This movie is an excellent example of 'show not tell.' The actors' performances carry so much more meaning than any exposition could. Beautifully directed. Amazing. I forgot to give Bill Camp credit too. He was phenomenal. Has me checking for every project he's involved with now. I’m not sold on this. You can see Ruben’s mindset change at the end of the movie. He would fit it now, even if everyone knew he had the operation. He did sort of burn the bridge by asking for money instead of understanding his place there, but Joe seemed like a forgiving kind of guy that wants to see Ruben in a good place. Thanks for the response.

Regarding the ending i don't think it means he'll not use the implant again, but it showed he made peace with his situation rather than constantly fighting against and rejecting it. He was finally able to sit with it in silence finding that ""kingdom of god""/inner peace moment Joe talked to him about. It’s both, which is why some people with implants shout “I hear normally!!” When they actually don’t. Their brain just got used to it. Implants only have 16 electrodes that recognize sound compared to hundreds of thousands of hair cells that hearing people have that allow them to hear, so our brains get used to hearing with just 16 and kind of fills in the blanks of sound/ interprets it as more complex than it is because it knows sounds are supposed to be more complex. Lots of that kind of stuff involved haha. Hearing people can still hear wayyyyy better than implanted even if the hearing tests say “perfect” hearing. Hearing tests just show that you’re hearing in that frequency, not how many different sounds in that frequency you can hear. Hearing is complex and I hate it with other implant patients say they hear normally and us other ones need to stop complaining when it’s so different for each person, and they probably don’t understand the process at all I definitely still would have, it would have just made it easier to adjust if they were honest Interesting! Hadn’t picked up on the second half of your observation i agree and plus joe didn’t say he couldn’t ever come back, he said “presently, in your current condition” pretty soon after saying he sounded like a junkie. i’m imagining ruben absolutely went back there.

58,"I just want to know more about Cthulhu and the drill. Like what the fuck were they trying to drill to and find. Props to Kristen Stewart for going full Ellen Ripley and killing Cthulhu! Overall, I thought it was good for what it was. Always love a good Creature Feature. Definitely can compare to Alien, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Loved the creatures. Wish they were shown a little less in the movie to keep with the mystery of their appearance. But, when they were hidden and snuck around with very little to be seen, it was admittedly tense. The deaths were surprisingly brutal. Reminded me of Life in that regard. Was really into that. Slow motion shots were done very well and the cinematography was definitely there. Also, a very surprising ending with revealing >!the giant Cthulhu type monster. That honestly shocked me. And to see Kristen Stewart sacrifice herself to destroy the base and the monsters.!< It did have it's problems. Sometimes it was hard to understand some of the dialogue. Some of the jokes didn't land, but most did. I'm a TJ Miller fan, so it was very reminiscent to his role in Cloverfield. Solid enough for me to stay entertained through it's hour and a half runtime. Would watch it again. 6.5/10 for me. Great creature design and effects. Cool shots.  Pretty nice cast. Paper thin story and characters. Kristen Stewart is the sexiest woman on Earth and TJ Miller has been playing the same character for a decade. 

This all adds up to a mild thumbs up especially in the depressing slog of life that is January. Interesting observation:

>!When they first meet the captain (Lucien), he says that he got 20+ people out using the escape pods.  But at the end of the movie, news reports say that only 2 survivors were found (Smith and Emily).  This implies that the creatures snatched all of the people Captain Lucien thought he saved, and would have gotten Smith and Emily's pods as well, making Norah's sacrifice all the more necessary.!<

>!Only thought about this when one my friends said ""Those pods were going pretty fast, I don't think the monsters could have caught them so why did Norah have to blow herself up?""!<

I did have a few questions of my own though:

>!Captain Lucien stated ""There's nothing there"" when asked about an old mining station; however that's exactly where Norah ends up after she blacks out.  There, she finds Lucien's old nametag and uniform, meaning he worked there.  Was he hiding this information on purpose?  Why was that station abandoned?  Why did it appear so isolated on the map and away from all other points of interest?  What was he working on?  He also seemed particularly un-phased by the discovery of the creatures, almost as if he already knew about their existence.  !<

>!I'm particularly intrigued by the creatures, especially the Queen/Alpha.  Most deep-sea creatures are scavengers, feeding on dead or decaying material that sinks from above, but these things were obviously predatory in nature, which makes me wonder what they would be hunting down there.  Were they drawn to that location due to the drilling or were they in long-term hibernation and disturbed when the mining began?!< Correct me if I'm wrong, but when Nora pulled Paul out of the rubble, did he call her a ""sweet, flat-chested elven creature""? Because that's what it sounded like and it was incredible Those suits were some of the nicest, aesthetically pleasing “exo suit” type suits I’ve seen in a very long time.

Sorry for saying “suit” so much, but jeeze they were neat to look at. Something about humanoid monsters creep me out.

The reveal of the big one scared me because at one point it looked like a huge humanoid thing just walking towards them. Really liked this movie. One of my favorite little untold details was how the station reactors had a UI to turn it into a bomb, including blast radius, simple initiation, count down, and sensors on the pods to detect ""approaching entities"".  There were obviously hints before the end that the captain/company knew about the creatures and likely were ""drilling"" as a coverup for studying them, but I thought the bomb details were a nice touch. I found this to be quite solid and I really appreciated that it was short and tight and fast paced. Ad astra just dragged in my opinion and this was the complete opposite. My main plot hole was why she couldn’t just sit on her friends lap at the end. Surely they design those pods to support a 250lb male so why can’t two 110 lbs women squeeze in? exactly as advertised, 10/10 wetness The scene where Kristen Stewart almost gets eaten alive by one of the creatures was pretty terrifying I'm still pissed at how similar this is to the origin of the Cloverfield movie without being a prequel to Cloverfield. Decent movie over all though Was not expecting the giant cthulhu like creature at the end. Were the smaller ones swimming in and out of the big one? Some parts looked like it would trigger people with trypophobia Regarding TJ Miller:

Hi. Im a former US army infantryman. I deployed overseas.

There are ALWAYS people cracking jokes in terrible times. Always. Those people tend to handle stress a lot better. Even his matter-of-fact delivery style felt right. Just my 2 cents.

Now lets discuss how we all just clearly saw fucking Dagon. 

(and how we all lowkey wanted Dagon to live. ) what kind of psychopath doesn’t spit out their toothpaste So, did everyone miss how >!T.J. Miller's chest tattoo was literally Cthulhu, or are we all too hung up on the Cthulhu sketch in the locker?!< I honestly loved this movie and its my favorite original monster movie since Cloverfield.  Love the setting, it is terrifying place to be in a situation like this and does a great job making the outcome look bleak.  Characters are all likeable.  Acting is done well.  

Jump scares got me a bunch of times.  Including a scene they are all walking underwater and one of the creatures appears like 3 times within 2 minutes.  

Fast paced movie that never lets up.  Very quick movie that is action packed and has you on the edge of your seat.  

Go see and support this movie This was an interpretation of Call of Cthulu and I was pretty into it The chaotic ""shit hits the fan"" sequence in the beginning of the film where we saw Kristen slippin', slidin', and yelling throughout the halls was my favorite part of the movie. I really felt the urgency of the entire scene. 

While I do enjoy the music they used throughout the film, I think I would've enjoyed the scenes where they walk on the pitch black ocean floor without any music to increase tension, but with what we got, it was okay since I believed they were really walking on the ocean floor. I was fully sold when kristen stewart punched the other girl to get her into the pod SPOILER REVIEW AHEAD!!!!!

tl:Dr The set pieces and underwater scenes look fantastic, Everyone but TJ Miller does a fairly good job, the plot is simple but effective keeping up the pace with only a small amount of clunky dialogue, it doesn't bog you down with exposition or extended backstoriea, the monsters are a little simple >!but the big one makes up for it.!< If you are fan of Alien and other Sci Fi monster movies, this one is worth watching.

I really enjoyed this movie. Now I can admit I am quite biased as I love deep sea horror such as Deep Star Six and Leviathan. Plus I got stuck watching The Grudge remake last week and this is Video Gold in comparison. That said this is very good movie for fans of Alien style movie. The sets are absolutely gorgeous; you can really believe these characters are underwater. The underwater scenes are pitch black where there is no light so the audience is just as blind as the characters. But, besides the fact that it's what it would be like down there, it doesn't do it to hide bad effects from the audience or anything. 

The characters are pretty good throughout. Nora (Kristen Stewart) tries to do her best to stay calm >!but at once she reaches the old drill site she essentially breaks down, before bucking up, determined to stay alive.!< Jessica Henwick's character Emily does a good job of someone fraying at the seams, managing to just hold herself together >!and survives despite the movie making me think she wouldn't. Vincent Cassell's captain Sam is a little bland at times >!and makes what is easily the dumbest decision is the movie, going back for a bolt gun after rescuing someone a creature pulled away.!< But he manages to portray a fairly good Rock for the others to rely on. John Gallagher Jr plays Smith, who is in love with Emily and their relationship is quite believable, and a good friend of Nora's. He plays a guy way out of his wheelhouse but does the best he can to hold it together and helps other do the same. >!Unfortunately, hespends the latter half of the movie mostly unconscious due to oxygen deprivation.!<
>!Mamoudou Athie's character is dead in the first fifteen minutes so barely remember his name.!< And TJ Miller is not a great addition to this movie. His sole role is comic relief and while he has some actually good lines, many fall flat >!and I was glad to seem him go around the hallway point.!< 

Plot wise they don't waste any time. The movies starts, Kristen Stewart monologues for a minute or two, and then the whole place falls apart. From their is almost non stop, with the exception of a few slower moments so the audience isn't overwhelmed, >!as they try to escape the main building an reach one over a mile away that is still intact.!< They don't waste time trying to figure and explain what happened, instead focusing on their survival. A few pieces of dialogue are bit clunky such as TJ Miller, and some story from Nora about her dead finance, but they are few enough that they don't drag it down too much.

As for the creatures, I both like and dislike them. They have a basic design of a humanoid upper body and some kind of jellyfish like lower body, although it's hard to tell as we only ever get a good solid look at their upper bodies. However their appearance is kinda bland to me. They are too similar to humans in my opinion, I would have preferred if they were more like deep sea creatures in design. And there are a couple of times were the CGI falls thru, although there is a decent amount of practical effect in this as well >!The Big One is seriously cool though. Again I'm biased since I love giant monsters, but even so the design is much better. While we don't see it's lower body almost at all, what see off its upper body is distinctly alien in design. Large tentacles on its back, multiple eyes, huge three part mouth covered in teeth, tentacle beard, and strange looking hands. The movie does a good job at hinting about it as they mention how the station is 70% compromised in minutes, or that a 6000 ton drill was uprooted with extreme force.!< 

Overall, while it is not redefining the genre or doing anything revolutionary, this is a very enjoyable movie. If you are a fan of Sci Fi monster movies like Alien, I would seriously recommend you give this movie a look. I went in with absolutely bottomed out expectations. I Expected a complete January dud. Instead I got the best sci-fi thriller I've seen in years. I've been out of the theatre for 12 hours now and the little details keep resurfacing and putting a smile on my face.

 I expect it to be a cult classic in the same vein of Sunshine or Donnie Darko. 

The production design was fantastic (I eat up psudo-realistic sci-fi). The creatures, the suits, the station, everything was brimming with robust industrial style. The cinematography was fantastic. Each claustrophobic tunnel and wide open ocean scene added weight and tension to every scene.

The characters are pretty stereotypical tropes (the mechanic, the joker, the captain) But most of the cast have moment that allow them to escape their preconceived tropes to make them memorable. 

The audio design enhanced the cinematography to create real tension. The score! The aquatic ambience suited the film and really enhanced the experience for me.  

This is really a case of critics not understanding sci-fi. It's not a character drama. There are quite a few small moments where you can see these characters are family. Shown through action and not bogged down with blocks of dialog.

The last time I saw a movie more than once in a theatre was Dunkirk (That was only because of Regal's Oscar reruns). I can't wait to get lost in this movie again. Good thing they had a convenient 'melt down the core button'... that seems too easy. Also the read out to show the monsters chasing the pods and the blast radius, good thing they programmed that! Stewart's character was shown to be smart, able to hot wire stuff and rig up the other suit etc. then to just not use that at the end really seemed like a weird miss. Also black guy dies first? Come on! Edit: also was anyone else hoping the bunny paid off? Like they had to stuff in something to stop a fuel or air leak or something... If this movie just went a bit further and made Titan a front for a cult, and the captain a conflicted member. This thing would have come right together. Still a fun ride. Glad the responses for this generally look positive. I'm not expecting much but sci-fi horror is a favorite of mine so if this is at least passable I'll be happy. There's an excellent movie in here if they took an extra couple of minutes to expand on the company being a front for a cult and the captain looking to old gods to bring back his daughter If TJ Miller wasn’t such a bad guy in real life, he would’ve had a nice career for basically his whole life. Very surprised how good this movie was! I saw someone on Twitter describe this as the ideal January sci-fi thriller and I’d agree. It’s a rewrite away (and some technical fixes, good god that sound mix is bad) from being very good but it’s only 90 minutes and it’s totally fine fun if you have time to kill. I do wish there were more characters in this so there could be a higher body count. There wasn’t enough gruesomeness to go around. I wanted more shit like the guy being pressurized to death and TJ Miller being ripped out of his suit.

I also thought this was going to go in a totally out there place for a while, too. There’s this line Kristen Stewart has at the beginning talking about how you never really have a sense of time underwater, and then Vincent Cassell being confused over how old his daughter would be. It seemed like they’d have this cool twist at the end where things aren’t really what they seemed but it never came. Shame because it could have made this stand out as something really interesting instead of a pretty standard monster flick. They tried to distract you from how much you hate TJ Miller with a stuffed bunny. This film felt like they were going to ham fist a “Cloverfield” timeline into it. All that said, I really liked it. Anybody else disappointed that Stewart's character didn't investigate the creepy drawings in the captains locker at Shepherd station? It looked like they could have added much more creepiness, but she just shrugs it off. Now knowing that this movie has some cultist undertones, I was wondering if anyone recalled the painting that was focused on while they are suiting up in their diving suits.  I'm assuming that it has some clues as to what is going on. The designers of this base must have had a lot of fore-thought when programming the reactor fail-safes. Making sure that an engineer from a different sector would be able set it to blow in 1 minute from any terminal in case they had to kill Cthulhu.  
How convenient. Far better than expected.

If anyone of you liked Pandorum, Outlander etc... I liked the role reversal of the boyfriend being in distress and the girl carrying him. Felt unexpected Honestly I liked it. Felt like the closest thing in tone as I've seen to a live action deadspace movie. Y'know, except it's underwater. One thing I’ll say about this movie is... it’s better than The Grudge so it has that going for it! Copy pasted from my previous post.



I was pleasently surprised by the film. I feel like it reminded me of LIFE/Gravity with an abyss like setting thrown in.....oh and a dash of cthulu 

Pros:

Awesome costume design

Characters weren't stupid

Genuinely scared me twice

Awesome set design

I liked the plot for what it was

Cons:

Everyone besides paul and the captain were a little bland

In-suit scenes were sometimes hard to see

Ending was rushed

.......


I REALLY liked that the characters weren't brain dead. There was a decent amount of moments where they didn't do the obvious dumb tropey thing. Also once again the diving suits looked absolutely awesome.

I think the film delivered on what it set out to do and was rather well paced.

I'd give it a solid 8/10, though I am a huge sucker for underwater films. This movie kicked ass. I can see it developing a cult following akin to Pandorum. Also reminded me a lot of the game SOMA, one of the best games of its kind I've played. Really enjoyed this movie.

Has anyone read the script? I remember seeing some people shitting on it and mentioning a terrible twist. So it sounds like there's universal agreement the end monster was Cthulhu? I was confused the entire movie as to why the monsters would have arms, legs, and opposable thumbs, yet be from the bottom of the ocean. The movie in no way was marketed, written, or executed as if it was dealing with cosmic beings. To me it makes it worth a second watch. 

Also, was there a random octopus monster like halfway through after the captain gets dragged away? Kristin Stewart runs away from it and it's never seen again. That gave me the impression that there were many different types of undiscovered sea lifeforms down there, further taking me out of the Cthulhu mentality. This movie had a Cthulu and two girls in bikinis. B+ Man, I really cannot trust film critics anymore.

Excellent little Alien/The Abyss inspired horror thriller with zero fat around/before the action (>!as in all the exposition is done by the end of the opening credits!<) which I can't say I would have expected to like but they did well enough when it came to character development during the run of the movie that it worked... 

Was pretty spooky, the CGI was obviously made easier by the darkness of being at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. >!The monsters definitely suffered from ""shown to be incredibly powerful but then is scared of like, a flashlight, or people looking at it, or whatever, until it's time to pick someone off then its fearless"" syndrome. And they even said it was attracted to the light, why would it avoid flashlight beams?!< I've definitely seen better monsters in movies, but they did the job and were at least a little freaky looking. Couple of the deaths were very good, dying underwater can be very gross.

I don't know if it's just because I went in expecting way less or what but I thought it was very well acted. TJ Miller was trying his darndest, but wasn't that funny on the whole - but I still thought the movie did an excellent job portraying how people handle stress differently. Paul was a great portrayal of the type of person who automatically goes to gallows humor, Emily was the person who can't shut up about random topics because they need to talk to avoid their fear. 

Biggest positive about the film: the characters feel extremely real and don't make any dumb horror movie choices. They act like real people would in their situation in a way not many horror movies reach.


I can't think of another Kristen Stewart movie I've seen since Twilight. She was much, much better in this and was given a much more relatable, human character to work with. I thought she was like an anti-actor, or like being possessed by the spirit of an especially boring brick wall before seeing Underwater. Which btw, dumb name. But I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys monster movies or people stuck somewhere where things are going wrong movies. And anyone who enjoys >!Cthulhu!!< Was that supposed to be Cthulhu? Didn't they say at the beginning that some 22 pods already made their way to the surface? Wouldn't those 22 folks be mentioned in the news as survivors? The ending credits just mentioned the 2 survivors. When Norah opens captain Lucien's old locker on Shepard station, [there is Lovecraft's sketch of Cthulhu](https://i.imgur.com/vafzQVt.png)

[here is lovecraft's sketch from wiki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Cthulhu_sketch_by_Lovecraft.jpg) I enjoyed this movie, but it felt good when it could have been a lot better with just a small addition.

When Norah stops at Shepherd Base (the abandoned rig) it would have been awesome if she had discovered some signs that the company knew what was down there. Some cult iconography and such, some evidence of legends. The way they lingered on the captain's locker was suggestive, but there wasn't really anything to see.

I did have one big question though. Near the end, just before Norah makes it into the final base and we see the huge monster, there is an explosion that saves her. Where did that come from? Did the other girl do it? Or was it the monster shooting something at Norah? It seemed to come out of nowhere and wasn't ever mentioned after that. Is this the first time Vincent Cassel hasn't played a complete douche? I swear every film i see him in he tends to be evil or have a nasty streak in some shape or form.

Anyway, film was a bit so so, half the time couldn't hear what the cast were saying, and the camera work was all over the place. Not getting the Dead Space comparisons at all, though there were some brutal deaths here.

Kirsten Stewart seems to be a bit of an underrated actress, probably something to do with the public perception of her in the media, she was very good in this, bonus points for being in panties half the time. Great underwater monster movie. There aren’t many of them and this one is worth a watch. Love how the movie starts right away, no setup, just jumps straight in. Great underwater suit and monster designs. It was a lot more claustrophobic than I thought it would be too.

The end credits song is so out of place and random though also the comic relief character didn’t work...he too felt out of place at times. Too much water 7/10. I liked this movie a lot, however, I felt like it had better potential to be a survival movie without the monsters. Sort of like an underwater version of Gravity. I loved the scene where the dudes helmet cracked and he imploded, I loved the suits and how they were traversing the ocean floor. Most of the suspense for me came from the possible malfunctions in their suits/plot elements related to the challenges of being that deep underwater, the creatures didn’t really do much for me. That being said— the end reveal of that giant monster was absolutely epic. The funniest part was where the captain called for a volunteer to investigate the distress signal from the pod below them. The cowardly Emily's terrified ""What?"" response after Paul jokingly recommended her for the task was hilarious. It was also refreshingly politically incorrect for an age of heroic female movie characters.

> 00:31:34,746: Captain: 
> Guys, somebody's gonna have to suit up.
> 
> 00:31:37,548: Paul: 
> All right, Emily, this is your time.
> 
> 00:31:39,517: Emily: 
> What?
> 
> 00:31:41,352: Paul: 
> I'm just messing with you. So the reviews aren't that hot but man I will honestly just never get sick of giant monster horror movies or space/underwater horror settings. There's something about the mood and atmosphere of them that I absolutely eat up. Really enjoyed this. I liked how the action starts straight away as the tension never really stopped. I actually felt like it was similar to the descent but underwater. 

The creature design was great and along with how dark it was the creatures always seemed on the periphery so you couldn't catch a good glimpse of them. 

I thought the fact the film only hinted that the captain knew what was going on also helped. There was something about him that didn't sit right throughout and the film leaves it to your imagination. 

Overall really enjoyable and far better than I expected. I've seen some trash at the cinema and I'm glad to say this is worth a watch. 4/5. Anybody else notice the cult symbol in the captains locker near the end? He, and possibly the company, are worshippers and are trying to awaken cthulhu This movie had such an Aliens vibe. Norah was very much Ellen Ripley. I also love how they subverted the chest burster trope by having Norah burst out of the alien’s body, rather than the other way around. I've seen it a couple of times and really dug it. Wasn't perfect, it had flaws, but it was a serviceable movie. All that being said, I'd like to have a sit-down with Lucien to ask him some questions... Perfect 3 am movie to watch on a hot night drinking a cold soda and eating a stake Damn, I had high hopes for this.

The acting was appalling, and I like most of the actors involved. Kirsten was especially dreadful. 

The writing was abysmal. The characters didn’t make much sense, and it was basically them on the run from the very start till the end. How boring. Didn’t get to know them, had no reason to like them. 

The scares were all but nonexistent. 

One of the most aggressively shite films I’ve seen in a while. I struggle to give it more than a 3/10. This movie exceeded my expectations.  I feel the fast start really helped me enjoy the movie and the movie being around 90 minutes didn't make it seem overly long.

I wouldn't recommend anyone run to the theaters to see it but it will be really enjoyable on streaming. Some thoughts:

The opening sequence goes *hard* in on Aliens-esque vibes. Her crew jacket. The hallways look like they were painted in late 70s/early 80s mall parking lot designs. The computer she has to reboot has the display and font feel of an upright arcade game. But then everything else later is beautifully modern..? Such a disconnect that just made all those nods seem more ham fisted.

This movie felt longer than its runtime.

There was a lot of good and a lot of mediocre. I wish it was distributed all in one section; Poor 1st act that gets better or vice versa, but as-is it kept ebbing and flowing between the two and ultimately suffers for it on the whole. 

T.J. Miller, just, ugh. 

Kristen Stewart is not terrible but she’s not great. Most of the small cast is just there. The captain and the other girl were the only interesting ones for me. 

The >!reveal of the giant Cthulhu-like creature towards the end was genuinely creepy!<. 

I did appreciate that the suits seemed appropriately ‘heavy’ and real.

They commit the biggest sin of >!bringing an unknown hostile creature back with them!<, despite showing hints of not being the typical super dumb sci-fi characters. Plot device for no pants, and then one of my favorite beings in fiction writing as the bad guy. 

I love this movie, but I tend to love crappy movies. I'm surprised. I'm came away quite dissapointed in the film, only to find a lot of positivity on here. Personally, I couldn't tell the majority if the time which character was getting attacked and what was happening. Wow so apparently the first guy that was attacked by the creature (the guy that they heard in the transmission) was played by the guy who played Isaac Clarke in the Dead Space trilogy. I liked when they got into their suits while listening to SpongeBob This movie was actually pretty entertaining. I recommend it if you like sci fi, monster, or suspenseful movies. Surprised how entertaining it was. Solid 7. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I'm not really a fan of Kristen Stewart, so I wasn't expecting much of anything going into it, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I thought she actually did a really great job as the lead. 

The movie ends up being a cross between Alien & The Descent; it has the claustrophobia, the chestburster looking mf, creatures, tough/strong females, and underwear.

C- Question!

When Nora made it to the final base/station and opened up the Captain's locker, there were totally some monster lookin sketches and what not next to the map right?? I wish they would have brought that up. Over all I loved the movie, the setting was nice, the characters were believable, and as a horror movie it was pretty tense. 

As a movie set in Lovecraft's universe, it falls short of his style of horror. Personally it needs more mystery and struggles with madness before the final confrontation.

Still, the movie was very enjoyable until the very end. Anyone notice the pentagrams on the map in the captain’s old locker? Were they drilling to hell? The movie that filled the Dead Space in my heart. Honestly pretty fucking cool. Didn't overdo it with the monsters and the reveal at the end was fucking sick. Anyone else think the underwater suits looked a lot like the suits from the Gears of War series when they didn't have their helmets on? My stepson and I went to this last night.

Honestly? I fucking loved this movie. It moves crazy fast, the characters in it are all pretty memorable, the creatures have cool designs, and it's an obvious love letter to Alien and Dead Space. I found it surprisingly good ! Much better than expected.

I was worried at the beginning with the shaky cam that the whole movie would be like that but thankfully no.

Actors were alright, I honestly don't get the Kristen Stewart hate bandwagon. She was pretty good. People still think it's ""cool"" to hate her for Twilight apparently.

The ending was unexpected, I thought everyone would die except the main character(Kristen) like all horror/thriller movies. That giant monster was particularly amazing. I really didn't expect that and I'm glad they didn't show it in the trailer !

Maybe this movie sets things up for a sequel ? Because there's definitly still tons of questions and mysteries unanswered.

I give it a 7/10. Good flick if you're fan of the genre. I liked this movie. Solid entertaining. Many tense moments. Good acting.. Plus, Kristen Stewart running around in a bikini is eyecandy 🥵 It was incoherent and terribly written. Acting was fine considering how bad the writing was but nothing to write home about, some characters werent very convincing.

Looked really good visually, but struggled in every other department. Feel like the monsters could gave been a little more imaginitive as well.

4/10. Sci-fi underwater movies are in short supply, so I was pretty happy with this. Was the perfect movie to watch late at night in the dark. The pacing is a little too fast at times, and it could have used just a little more exposition, but overall I think the audience rating at Rotten Tomatoes (60%) is right. >!Kristen Stewart nuked Super Value Brand C'thulu.!<  Good enough for me Kristen Stewart is great in this.  Between this and Charlie's Angels, I hope that she gets more action roles, and better scripts to work with, because I think that she could be good at it.

Also she pulls off the short hair/shaved head look VERY well, it looks great on her.

The rest of the film was, decent.  Some good claustrophobic moments, the monster looked pretty good, the underwater setting works well, etc.  But the script was, meh, and there were some inconsistencies.

I'd give it a ""B"" probably.  And it's better than most January horror films are, that's for sure. I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. It was difficult to orient myself within the movie, which added to the chaotic atmosphere the movie created. I wish I cared more about the characters, there was never anytime taken to develop the characters and I never felt invested in them. Overall I enjoyed it. Great costume, set, and creature design. Wish there was more world building. Also I wish they would have made it easier to tell which character was which when they had the suits on. Something as easy as everyone has a different color glowstick or different light emitting from their suit. Could have played into the creatures seeing the light too. I just think it would have made it easier to tell who was involved in some of the scenes. But overall, pretty solid. I went in with really low expectations and ended up liking it more than I thought. The writing was bad and the movie didn’t make sense at parts but the visuals were incredible and I thought the acting was better than what it should have been given the writing. I don’t think Kristen Stewart was terrible either. 

6/10. TJ Miller annoyed me a little (still funny) and it could have used more horror elements but overall I still enjoyed the movie! Good timing and pace, enjoyable but the low critic rating is warranted.

The movie felt more like a video game, it would have been a good Dead Space game with some stupid quick time events.  Monsters are just showing up in places they could not have gotten into or if they had would have been flooded with water, there are artificial scarcities and they go from point to point with a boss fight at the end. I hope this movie does well. I like Jessica Henwick and hope to see her in more stuff. This movie was a mess.

Great idea, terrible execution. Should have given the idea to someone else. 

The actors were great, but it's how they were played out. 

The characters who actually provided sustenance to the movie died first so that was the stupidest shit. 

Then the character who didn't do shit but whine and the character I forgot was even a part of the crew were the only ones to make it. 

I had nothing to grasp on to have the incentive to root for any of the characters. 

5/10. 

Aesthetically, though, I'd definitely give it a 10/10. Enjoyed the movie for all the reasons stated below. Future tech. Fine cool all about it. BUT THEN. Tiny Asian girl breaks a hole in a visor that up until this point has survived being at a depth of 7.9 miles which according to someone else's math is 7-8tons per square inch. I honestly dont know why she couldnt have just taken KStew's helmet off. They should've but just built a cyclops. I actually really liked the movie. It didn't try to cram in too much useless dialogue and looked amazing. This was AWESOME.  It's kind of like Alien but set in the ocean. Did we ever have any solid proof that it was in fact an earthquake in the beginning ? Why did Captain Lucien tell them Sheperd was not even there anymore and did he know that the roebuck was completely infested ? Did he start all this trying to get people to help him raise Cthulhu? I just need more information or I’m never gonna sleep lol It was an intense film, even if the story wasn't too complicated. Solid directing. My one complaint is that the music in the last scene didn't fit he mood at all. I say the movie was decent. It's one of those movies you just wanna watch and not think about too much. Although, I kept thinking about Cthulhu when I saw the monster towards the end. Also, the pressure suits they were using, the chest part kinda reminds me of the Gears of War armour and I forgot the guys name, but the one that has a bandana on his head reminds me of Dom. I liked the vibe and visuals, but I didn't love it overall. To be honest, I think it would have been a great pickup for Netflix. I thought it was a pretty entertaining movie. Admittedly I don’t typically gravitate towards monster flicks but had some spare time to see this one. I enjoyed the set pieces and the grit and grime in a facility that would certainly beg for perfection seeing as it was the edge of the world. A comment on corporate laziness I suppose. I thought TJ Miller was a good take on the comedic relief for such a movie and Kristen Stewart did well with what she was given. My only gripe plot-wise is the total lack of any other characters outside the main cast, in a place that should have plenty. I guess most were able to escape while she was blacked out from the first fall she took at the very beginning? Overall I agree with some of the prior commenters here; It had the potential to trend more towards a good character film but traded those moments in for action. 7/10 Underwater white dementors with faces. Excellent creature design. I really liked this one Much better than I thought it would be.  I have a thing for underwater horror, and this one hit all the right notes.  It's a lean, to the point movie, but in this genre, that's a good thing.  The characters didn't do anything stupid (arguable that bringing back the first creature wasn't dumb), the design was stellar (THOSE SUITS!!!), and the monster reveal at the end was awesome.  It set out with a purpose and hit it on the nose.  I love that the movie turns the tension up immediately and keeps it there pretty much until the final scene. That shit was dope fam Easily could have been reworked into the third cloverfield movie instead of the netflix installment. This movie played out like one of my complaining rants about how there aren't enough giant sea monster/Lovecraftian flicks out there.

ME: ""I just want someone deep underwater, in the vast terrifying open ocean. I want them to shine a light out into the darkness, and a big fucking monster to be there.""

HOLLYWOOD: "". . . yeah, ok."" My two cents before I read the comments:

I fucking loved this movie. I had more fun here then with Rise of Skywalker. The tension was great, acting was believable, the monsters HOLY SHIT the monsters, the claustrophobic atmosphere.

I was 100% satisfied...ok maybe like 95% satisfied because the way it ends seemed a bit too convenient (authorize facility meltdown from an escape pod room?). But other then that hot damn was it a fun ride. 

Solid ""A"" for me. Solid 6/10. A lot of TJ Millers lines landed awkward and his comedic timing seemed off. Fast paced with almost zero exposition. Dug the setting, good time. All in all I enjoyed this movie. Nice little horror/creature feature and certainly an above-average January movie release.

Some of the underwater scenes were a tad hard to follow though. Really fun quick movie, reminds me a lot of the book Sphere, actually. Loved that one Didn't think this would be good then I found out it was directed  by the guy who did ""the signal"" which I liked so I gave it a chance. Definitely better than I originally expected and kept me entertained. Just came back from it now, one thing I’m surprised about is how under marketed this movie is, it came out last week in my state here in Australia and now the only session times are after 9pm for it. I don’t think seen a poster or any form of advertising for it prior to the trailer I was tagged. in on Facebook months ago.

Ultimately this is a shame as it’s a pretty decent movie. The setting and creature design is cool/fresh. I love creature films and I would’ve loved if they showed different life at the bottom of the ocean besides the one thing Kirsten Stewart woke up next to her after SPOILER losing the captain. It might’ve been cool to have a giant squid these creatures destroyed.

I thought it might be a possibility a creature made it into the ship besides the one that got TJ Miller however not the case. Actually speaking on that how did a sizeable creature, enough to pull him out of his suit, get into the base? The water was flowing through a crack into the little section they had to swim through, those creatures were pretty big so strange they left it as soon as TJ Miller died they didn’t really want to bother with the one in with them.

Anyways I enjoyed it and I will always try to get to the creature feature movies so we have more of them in the future but it’s a shame this didn’t get the attention I feel it’s worthy of. Hopefully streaming services bring attention to it as it did seem they were pushing for the sequel set up at the end with the newspaper clippings but to likely no avail based off it flopping I watched it on a whim tonight and was pleasantly surprised to thoroughly enjoy it.  It doesn't redefine the genre or anything but if the description/summary catches your interest at all it's worth a watch. Well made little movie. Well directed, shot, acted, especially Stewart. Creatures designs were top notch as well

It’s an enjoyable movie. Should have been a six episode TV series instead, with the same production value, and some time for the characters to grow on you before they die. The Cloverfield prequel that was somewhat better than Cloverfield Paradox... 


By the way did the one character ever give the moon pie to Emily? Was that just ignored?  



Also thought the beginning with Kristen Stewart handling the cute dandy long leg was going to be a reference to her being kind towards the monsters in the end of something but it seemed irrelevant?


I was entertaining but the movie felt like so many other movies that it got a bit stale and boring. [deleted] Anyone notice the Irreversible reference with the fire extinguisher? Vincent Cassel was also in that movie! Any theories on how >!the monster that killed TJ Miller's character got in that area/section?!< It's one of the few things that bothered me a little.

But I looked at the review scores on this page before going in so I had low expectations, but GOD DAMN did I enjoy the movie. Only had some issues with the sound/audio because 

1: It kept scratching out in our theater during really loud parts and 2: it was hard to hear the dialogue at times. How did the end monster know to start swimming away. Was he like 'oh shit she armed the bomb let me get out of here!' Really enjoyed it, it wasn't interstellar underwater but I'm a sci fi/horror junkie The film was decently entertaining.  A good way to kill 2 hours.  Sometimes the action is hard to follow with the suits and murky sequences though. Huge plothole? When they find the captain at the start of the film he's already sent 22 people to the surface. Why at the end of the film it says only the 2 survived? Honestly go fuck yourself if Kristen Stewart kills the Dark Lord Cthulhu Whoa I kinda LOVED this. 

Brutal deaths despite PG-13? Check. 

Surprisingly solid cinematography? Check. 

A badass role that actually fits Kristen Stewart’s strengths? Check. 

There were a notable amount of fade to blacks that make me wonder about the editing process, but what we got here I still thought was really fun and scary. Tons of moments genuinely made me jump, and the movie is constantly keeping things tense the entire time. 

And that opening!! Starts with a bang and never lets up. It’s everything child me wanted Deep Star Six and Leviathan to be. It looks expensive and is pretty much the best Syfy movie ever made. Totally worth a ticket in my book. I really wanted to love this movie. Everything about it felt like something I would kill to see on the big screen... the CG wasn't laughably bad like I expected, the costumes looked incredible like something believable, the sets looked pretty real, and the underwater scenes looked like they were actually underwater in the dark, scary depths. The acting was... alright, but I dont think it needed to be anything A+.

...but I just left feeling somewhat disappointed. It's like they people who made this movie glanced over an HP Lovecraft inspired piece of art and went ""Yeah, that's what's scary. Underwater monsters!"" Like, it feels painfully hollow compared to what I felt like it could've been. The thing that kills me is that there are even little moments here that suggested they were interested in making it more of an Eldritch related horror movie, rather than a generic hunted by scifi monster movie. 

The locker room scene with the main character toward the end is a perfect example. Are we going to just so easily glance over A MAP WITH WEIRD ELDRITCH DRAWINGS THAT POINTS TO SOMETHING BIGGER? The captain clearly knew about the creature and there are other small details suggesting he was holding info from the group about big old sea boy. Why wasnt this the plot that was explored? The movie could do with more time delving into the weird and unsettling nature of these cool creatures they made, but right when it gets interesting it ends.

And that ending... introducing Cthulu or Dagon or whatever original monster it is, in a seriously cool way, only to kill them like... ten minutes later? Uncool. Took the horrifying monster and made it, well, lame. Nothing ""scary"" about it. And that monologue was cringe beyond belief. 

Imagine this: Our main character activates the self destruct feature in the base and sacrifices herself to nuke the big bad sea boy. The screen cuts to black just as it goes off and we see the two lovebirds who made it to the surface. They pop open their escape pods and hold each other, waiting to see their friend, excited they've survived... only her pod doesnt surface and instead we hear this loud, horrible scream come from below the waves. It shakes their pods and when they look down into the water, they see it rising.
 
Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like they took what they thought lovecraftian was supposed to be and made it into a movie, not really bothering to delve deeper into the psychological and otherworldly nature of the genre. It's like they were too afraid to get with the weird that would've made this movie way more fun and enjoyable. I didnt hate it, far from it. It felt like a first draft of something that could've been great, but chose to play it safe...ish. When they were suiting up did the guy in the beginning give her the broken helmet or keep it and sacrifice himself? If he did that’s actually so wholesome. I loved how the drill classes were named for old gods of the sea, titan, Poseidon. I wish we could get a prequel about the captain's prior experiences with the creatures. Do you think Cthulu survived? since the movie stated the company would continue drilling there Finally watched this film and for a paint by numbers sci-fi monster flick it was suprisingly good but could have really been so much more given the Cthulhu reference.

They should have did an Abyss/Event Horizon type psychological thriller movie where the crew begin to go mad. They could have said that being down this deep causes psychological breakdowns. The crew would start to hallucinate seeing monsters attacking each other and themselves. We are led to believe the same thing from the audience perspective. Then, with 1 or 2 people left alive, they finally make the big reveal showing the big guy but make his appearance seem dreamlike. The last few crew member sacrifice themselves trying to kill Cthulhu. We are left to think was this really all hallucinations and the people really went mad or if Cthulhu is real.

Sprinkling in Cthulhu cult worshipping hints like they did in the movie would add another layer to the mystery of the story.

Given that the movie didn't do well financially, I think that they could have taken this risk and the film may have developed a ""cult"" following similar to how other very well written sci-fi psychological movies have become. Question though, what was with Nora pushing on her sternum? That was surprisingly decent actually for a January horror. Color me impressed. The story itself was really generic and the ending felt rushed as hell but the cast did a pretty decent job with what little they were given to do. 6.5/10 [deleted] It was more like that movie ""Life"" than anything else, though I do see the Alien comparison being valid too. Ultimately I liked the movie, but I felt that some points kind of didn't mesh on a cinematography level.

Like when Kristen Stewart has her ""all is lost moment"" alone and they play this super weird  out of place pop anthem, and then at the end during the climax they do the same....These two scenes are really important in any story circle so to break into some kind of weird music and a voice over and drop the  visual tone suddenly the way like they did kind of took me out of the moment.  

It's almost like they took the conspiracy theories around that ""bloop"" sound that happened underwater in real life and made a movie.  I am not sure why they dumped the movie in January, it could have stood in October around Halloween as well.

Overall i give it 3 bags of popcorn and 2  sodas. First and foremost, I wasn't expecting too much for this film but within the first few minutes we go right to it. I for the most part was able to overlook some of the tech issues given the setting, though the set itself did give it that late 70's early 80's sci-fi feel, but it does match up with even the most 'modern' research and military vessels as far as interior. With the tension of the cascading and catastrophic failure of the station and the issues pressed for survival there is enough tension there is almost no need for monster. 

I'd say its worth a watch. I have no idea why, but the first shot already screamed ""Alien"" at me. The more the movie went out, the louder the scream was. I just finished the movie. I enjoyed it but it was a lot like Scott Snyder's comic book The Wake. 
 It starts with one ""small"" creature then there's a bunch of small creatures and then there's the king/queen creature all while being in an under water station and having to travel to another part against the sea ground? 
 I under stand those are a lot of archetypes of sci-fi horror film but it just seemed really familiar. Enjoyed the movie, but wish there were a bit more details to the station or monster. Finished it, i think the presure with 11k underwater will kill u in these ""suits"", but i really liked the movie. Was like a sip of fresh air due to the ""horror"" movies u get to see today. PD: sorry for the broken english. Personally i recommend this movie, more if u are into Lovecraft theme. Decent enough for a re-watch sometime in the future. Thought the tension during a few scenes were portrayed quite accurately and efficiently. I can imagine if you have claustrophobia or thalassophobia this movie would be pretty heavy. +1 for daddy Cthulhu and the effects weren't half bad. [deleted] It was okay, 5/10 but there is one thing that pisses me off with alien/monster/horror movies. Right before they’re about to hurt or kill the monster, they cut all music/ambient sound and make the actor deliver a cheesy line like “take this you son of a bitch”. Just stop with dumb trend, please ffs...

Also, was that a satanic star on the map in Lucien’s (Lucifer lol) locker? The thing that bothers me is that she could've just squeeze in with the girl in the pod lol, they look big enough to store 2 people. Very happy to see that everyone here loved it, I think that just goes to show we can’t really ever trust critics. It was a fun, creepy movie with a cool, intense climax at the end. Glad to have seen it opening night Fuck the person who made us believe that Kirsten Stewart can't act and got her banned from Hollywood movies. Charlie's Angels and Underwater are the first KStew movies I've seen since Twilight, I believe. Not bad, but I think it would’ve been better if more of the monsters from the script made it into the film. 

Also, TJ Miller’s character obsessing over a stuffed rabbit was totally a Doom reference right? I like it but I think it could have been better. I wish we could have seen the operational station for at least a little bit to get some better setup than the newspaper clipping intro.  The disaster strikes so early that I had no idea what was going on. This was surprisingly good. I mean, it's not the best thing ever, and it's not high art or anything, but's good. Definite recommend if you like monster/disaster movies. I feel like a lot of the movie was cut up, could explain why it feels like some things were set up but not explained further and the exposition dump via the newspaper pre/post film Seems like a missed opportunity to release this movie on Halloween season I haven't seen anyone mention the fire extinguisher scene! Totally a reference to Irreversible right??? The french movie Vincent Cassel was in where they murder a guy with a fire extinguisher to the face. In this film they save her life by a fire extinguisher to the face. Did anyone else think if this? anyone else got a gears of war vibe with the suits?

also how exactly did the creature pull paul out of his suit but it tried to eat the others whole? Am I the only only one that found it a odd choise to have the whole setup for the movie be news articles? Like the characters and relationships we are forced into and like... Why do I care if any of them die? I appreciate that it was probably just trying to create a tense environment from the start but it fell flat for me. Once it going it wasn't terrible, but the idea of the creatures and so forth were also just kinda there. Don't worry if you were concerned about a sequel or any kind of epilogue you'll be given... More news articles! Genuinely surprised by this film tbh, going into it thought it would be a run of the mill monster flick, but hot damn was it entertaining throughout, really liked the monster designs too. If I had any complaints it would probably be like we should have gotten maybe 20 minutes to see how the crew acts with one another, cause there isn't really much attachment to them since you're directly thrown into the action. All in all this was way better than I though it would be. I caught it last night and really wasn't impressed, even going in with low expectations.

There's no character development, the dialogue is pretty poor (especially that ending monologue), and there's nothing really original about the premise. The mythos was there and not fully revealed, but I think we needed more of it to have investment in the mission, the characters, etc.

The creature design(s) were really cool, as were the costumes, but that's about it. I never really bought into the paranoia or claustrophobia of being that deep in the sea even though it does scare the living shit out of me in reality.

I like K. Stew in it to a degree, though, but can only hope she goes back to smaller indie-like (not sure that's the right term) films like *Clouds of Sils Maria* and *Personal Shopper*. She was amazing in those two. I'm tired of the trope where the main character survives damage that would otherwise kill any other character. It's nothing you haven't seen before but I like the genre and Stewart so I enjoyed it. For a January movie I'm shocked it's not a giant pile of crap it's just a fox movie Disney has no idea what to do with Exactly what I wanted. I was claustrophobic the whole time! Man this movie was stressful to me: giant monsters and sea monsters are my biggest fears haha. 

I was surprised at how good this movie was as it was released in January, guess it’s no longer a dump for bad movies! 

This definitely gave me Cloverfield vibes and that’s one of my fave monster movies so this def ranks up there. It was pretty funny, tense as hell, and exciting, it was just a good time. The shots of the bigger monster were sooo well done, i loved the glimpses of it that we got with the lighting flashing in the background. I really had no idea what to expect when I went in, like maybe mermaids when I saw humanoid figures but anyways it was a good movie, def recommend it. Liked it. Had some issues but all Sci Fi does. What was the scene with the captain forgetting his daughters age?
He said she was 14, then Price says shes 24 but then you see a card saying she's 14.
Whats the significance of that? for the first hour I thought this could've been a really good sequel to Life, the movie with Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds.  anyone else? Did anyone else notice that the stuffed bunny was suddenly a real bunny in the final scene with the guy going up in the pod?  Just as the door closed, that was a real bunny.  


Edit: [https://i.imgur.com/QjZJlus.png](https://i.imgur.com/QjZJlus.png) This movie was awesome and I was frightened in some parts.

It had some shots that gave it this protorealistic pseudo documentary feel to it. And that made the monsters that much more scarier.

It is a low budget film that used every single dime the right way. The script was great, the characters never did anything stupid and it felt believable. Well except the first guy to die, that was stupid, but at least people got a good education about the bottom of the ocean from it. 

The thing at the end was incredible.

Kristen Stewart should do more sci fi. She is also a bonafide sex symbol and damn does she look great in this film. How much giant Cthulhu screen time is there? Is there a lot of monsters in the film? I’m a huge monster fan especially giant monsters. This movie reminded me a lot of Overlord. You know, it's like a smaller genre film and it basically follows our main character up close for the entire runtime and was probably not made for sequels. And that's all pretty rare these days, especially the last one, so I can appreciate it. I didn't think it was as good as Overlord, but it's certainly not laughably bad or anything. I was afraid it might get super dull but then a dudes head caved in and another turned to soup in his suit and I was like, yeah okay I'm in. 


The setting was pretty neat. Walking the Mariana Trench floor felt both claustrophobic from the lack of light and also very wide open in the sense that danger could have come from anywhere. There were hints of Gravity, Alien, The Abyss, all sorts of stuff which isn't a bad thing. I wouldn't call it devastatingly original, but it was original enough that it wasn't making me roll my eyes or I never felt like they were copying something verbatim. 

It did have some major issues. First of all, the movie starts right away. Within like five minutes shit is hitting the fan and it never really calms down after that. There's scenes where the characters are in a safe place but they're always moving forward and in danger. Which is kind of cool, but also really left me at a loss to understand some things. Why were they down there? What happened? Who are these people? Some of these questions are answered in throwaway lines here and there, but without any sort of introduction to the vessel or the characters it was hard to interpret the rest of the movie correctly. 


Wasn't sure where they were or needed to go, how big the station was. I think it was revealed to be a drilling station which is nice and politically relevant, but without any background of what they're drilling or why it's kinda just like *shrug*. 

I know in the trailer there's like hints of a scene where TJ Miller puts on some music through the PA and everyone's getting ready to party, they either only shot that for the trailer or just totally cut it out. A curious choice to say the least, it may have been tropey but it might have been good to see everyone before they were in crisis mode. Like, there's a scene where they bring one of the creatures on board and it's dead and they're inspecting it and the Asian actress touches one of its thorns with her bare hand and I was getting Prometheus flashbacks. It didn't cause anything bad to happen, but I didn't know how to feel about it because I didn't know if she was competent at what she did, or even what she did for the station. 

Anyways, if you're a fan of some of the movies this reminds you of it's probably worth a go for you. This probably won't be anyone's favorite movie but it will join a line of suspenseful and claustrophobic movies that are just fine for a watch. I'd give it an even 6/10.

/r/reviewsbyboner After a long day of tending to the pigs and repairing the thatching of my favorite cottage - I found some time to visit the theatre district and see a performance of the show ""Underwater""

I'm exhausted though, and the roosters will be crowing soon enough, so let's dive into this knave's no-BS breakdown and final rating:

**Storytelling:** A mixed bag. What I mean by this is that I've seen every *thriller* available at the local theatre these last 6 months, and this was - by far - a much more fleshed out story compared to some of the more recent offerings (ex: *Countdown*, *Black Christmas, The Grudge*). However, it suffers from a lack of character development, as well as convincing creature science. 

The show thrusts you right into the problem from the opening scene, and does a decent job at keeping things moving throughout. I do want to be clear in stating that there's no new ground broken here - many that see this one will immediately draw connections to other stories like *Alien, 10,000 leagues under the sea, The Abyss, leviathon, The cave...etc* \- you get the point, people do things that result in them being isolated in a difficult-to-navigate environment, and the only way out is through the problem so that they can *maybe* escape if everything goes right. This is a tried-and-true story we've seen and read (although I can't read) 1000 times before - however, its tried-and-true for a reason. In my opinion, monster stories that isolate characters and place them in unavoidable conflict are the absolute best type of sci-fi thriller/horror (Ex: *Jaws*, *The Thing*, *Alien*, *Jurassic Park*...etc), and this is trying to be a new entry into that club of films. It does not succeed however, and lands somewhere short of being memorable, but certainly re-watchable.

Speaking of characters, this is the weakest point of the story. This lad is a firm believer in that if you're going to have a movie centered around sci-fi monsters, at least include plenty of extras to be fodder in various gruesome ways. This wasn't a problem at first, as there was plenty going on, and people were dropping like flies for various reasons, but somewhere about halfway through - you start to see who has plot armor and who doesn't - and this quickly breaks the immersion as you realize some characters are immune to the grisly deaths that others quickly experienced.

As touched on above, none of the characters are fully developed or necessarily memorable. There's the funny guy from *deadpool* (T.J. Miller) playing a funny guy that says funny things, and then there's a woman that's a mechanical engineer and can open/hack any digital device around (Kristen Stewart), and then there's the captain (Vincent Cassel) - the only person that's actively trying to keep everyone alive - and then there's everyone else. I word it this way, because that's the extent of the development that takes place. There's some sidebar about Kristen Stewart having lost her fiancé at some point in the past, the captain is also revealed to have suffered a loss of his daughter that is never really elaborated on, and then two of the other miscellaneous characters like each other, and T.J. Miller has a favorite plushie that he brings with him because that's his *quirk*. I'll spoil that the plushie is one of the only things that survives - and many people put in a lot of effort to make sure it does.

I also want to briefly mention that the biology of the main threat is something I can't help but question. I've been told by wizards wise beyond their years - that any creature that's evolved within the aphotic zone - more than 7 miles down - will likely not rely on something like *eyesight* in order to catch its prey. instead, a creature would have much more powerful sensory abilities (i.e. the ability to detect heat signatures and sonar capability) versus needing light in order to hunt. Now, this aspect is never fully explored, and the director can certainly have the monster be and do whatever he wants, but there were *tense* scenes where characters - whom are standing on the ocean floor of the Mariana Trench (don't even get me started on the pressure/physics questions) - were scrambling to turn off their lights as monsters were searching for them, and it seemed to effectively keep them hidden and safe for some reason.

**Direction:** William Eubank (*The Signal*) put out a decent attempt with the direction of the film. The camera work and editing (albeit predictable) are effective, and the *cool* color palette containing deep shades of blues and blacks is perfect for the setting of the story. The thing that really separates *good* from *great* in this genre is that most people are more afraid by what they don't see versus what they do see. Many stories of this nature have been ruined by giving the main threat too much visibility on screen, as things tend to be less scary when the monster is fully in view. This film wasn't *ruined* per se, but I think most would agree that less is more within this type of genre, and this movie in particular would have benefited from keeping us in the dark more than it did; something that would have been easy enough to do. The scope of the threat becomes crystal clear eventually, and while it does reach a Cthulhu level of hopelessness during the final act - it wasn't necessary to show as much as Eubank opted to, and it would have likely been more interesting and eerie had the threat remained in the shadows, but ever-present

**Pacing:** No complaints. The movie kicks off with a bang (literally), and things pretty much don't stop from there. Some of the characters could have been more developed, but that horse has been kicked to death above.

**Acting:** The Acting was pretty good. There were some silly exchanges at various points throughout ""Ex: I like anime too!"", but the actors and actresses all did fine. This was never an issue for me.

**Sound:** The sound was good. There were some *gimmicky* loud moments to draw out jump scares at times, but I do remember thinking about halfway through that the overall score was surprisingly above par for this type of film. It almost had a *spacey* retro synth vibe to it at times, but then a slow ethereal feel at others. Definitely worth a listen if you enjoy atmospheric soundtrack music.

\--

**Final Verdict:** 6.5/10

Realistically this was an enjoyable film that isn't far from being a *great* film. The cast showed up, and they did the best with the material they were given, but had there been some changes to the lack of character development, some of the creature effects/ambiguity, and a little less plot predictability - this very easily could have been a B+/A- film. I do think it's worth noting that Fox has been sitting on this completed project for two years, and that in a lot of ways it felt like Disney acquired this movie and simply didn't know what to do with it - so they decided ""let's just throw it out in January and get rid of it"". It's a suprisingly high-production release for this time of year. There are also some genuinely grisly/terrifying moments in this movie - ironically none i'm referring to involve the monsters - but the opening sequence especially will be enough to make many people pass on ever staying in an underwater facility. 

If you thoroughly enjoy *Deep Blue Sea* and *Anacanda* \- this will likely be fun for you. If you're looking for the next *Abyss or Alien* though - this is not quite on that level of craftsmanship.

But I'm just a peasant. What do I know? I enjoyed this movie. 7/10 for me. I was honestly really surprised that T.J. Miller went out so early and John Gallagher Jr ends up surviving. It almost felt like they let Gallagher survive because he’s a smaller guy and the two ladies couldn’t have dragged Miller around?  Kristen Steward was awesome, honestly an underrated actress. The monsters were also sufficiently horrifying. I haven’t seen this movie and am a big fan of John Gallagher Jr. Can anyone who saw it tell me how much he’s in it so I can determine how urgently I should see this? I'm no expert on pressure and depressurization and all that fun stuff, but can someone explain >!how Paul died?  If I understand correctly, his body shouldn't have been imploded, since the pressure was equal.  I say that because everyone else had their helmets off, so I would think that when his pant leg got ripped off, there shouldn't have been a change in pressure.  Is that correct?!< I wished for a bit more character development but overall I loved the movie! Some straight up Cthulhu vibes. so in the credits they put the spongebob squarepants theme, and for the life of me i cannot remember a moment that was used. Did TJ miller’s character hum it or something? That’s the only thing I can think that might have happened Solid. Liked the touches of style at the beginning and end, with the slow motion and the echoes of Alien and Dead Space. Not original but still a decent film. It reminded me of Sunshine at the end with the slow motion explosion. I really liked it. Sure it had some issues but I still enjoyed it! Could barely see anything clearly. It was so dark and cloudy that I couldn’t tell what was happening and to whom most of the time. Otherwise it wasn’t terrible. Pretty good. Everything good about it has been said here. I thought it was fast paced, characters weren’t horror movie cliche stupid, the characters were good to passable, TJ Miller was funny, the jump scares were good, the creatures were interesting, the big Cthulhu esque monster was a cool surprise, and Kristen Stewart’s character actually sacrificing herself was a good way to change it up from the main final girl survives. 

A few things I didn’t like about it though. There’s no explanation for the creatures. That small pink creature that was brought in from the dead person’s back (that whole sequence reminded me of Alien) disappeared from the movie. It would have been nice to see the main monsters clearer at least once. Black guy dies first trope. TJ Miller could have lasted longer since no one else was funny. Stewart’s character had too much plot armor until she had anti plot armor since the escape pod was conveniently FUBAR. The explosion was a bit too easy as well. 

The good definitely outweighs the bad for me though, and what I didn’t like here were mostly nitpicks. This movie gave me a lot of Gears of War vibes. [deleted] Ending made no sense, there was more then enough room in the escape pods for 2 peoples. This is a terrible movie, but a must see if you are a fan of Lovecraft.

First Bird Box now this...We are slowly working towards a decent Cthulhu movie. It would have been a better movie if Kristen just played a depressed shy person again. Im not saying thats all she can play but the choice of her character was so poorly fit for her I struggled to look away from her dead fish eyes and forced non eye contact the whole movie. When they were suiting up, what was the painting on the wall? The Emily character seemed to get pretty freaked out about it just before they walked. I Just want to Say this... SOMA vibes... If this is your type of movie (and it is mine), you'll like it just fine. If you skoff at it, or still get on Steward for Twilight and refuse to see her as anything but boring Bella, you won't.I give it a solid B, maybe B-. It's a good enough creature feature. Very streamlined- putting any exposition in the opening credits kept from a bunch of ""as you knows"" of characters giving eachother info they know - and allowed to just straight up cut the first act of the movie. We're here for action-horror-survival and we just jump right on in.I was reminded on a story-thrill ride. From one disaster pushing us into the next. The characters are pure stereotype - the headstrong lead, the captain with a tragic past, the comic relief, the useless IT guy/back-up comic relief, the scared new person, and the cannon fodder. Plus, giant Cthulhu monster and a ton of little ones. Liked their design but sad they are CG. My big negative is the murkiness. It's expected for the bottom of the ocean but there were a lot of outside shots I wasn't sure what I was looking at. Curious to why the abandoned platform was still stocked like everyone just left. The Captain said its not there anymore but it was fine, just quickly abandoned. Expected something to come from that - like they found the monsters once before. When she looked at his ID card I thought she was about to plug it in and find out more details over what's happening. I wonder if that was originally there but cut in the ""eh, no one wants exposition in this movie"" end of things. The voiceovers on either end was weird but eh.

\--ps   keep seeing ""Alien underwater!"" but that's not really true. There is a ton of Alien in the DNA - the production design mainly - but it's way more Descent. I think its one of those that wears it's influences on its sleeve and people take that for ripping off rather than the filmmakers acknowledging the similarities.

Edit to add my published review:  [https://cityofgeek.com/2020/01/10/bob-underwater/](https://cityofgeek.com/2020/01/10/bob-underwater/) Really enjoyed this movie. Definitely not perfect but I think if it does well in the box office a sequel will come based off the ending. The sound design and mixing in this was fucking incredible.   Rest of the film was just average, but my god the sound was on point. Pretty solid. Solid creature design, really nice technical design on everything, solidly paced breadcrumbs of the deeper mystery, and didn't overstay its welcome. Overall pretty good, if a little cliche and predictable. Slusho, in my headcannon. I think the newspapers in the intro were talking about mining. I think it was just about resources. It reminded me of that South Park trilogy “Coon & Friends” 😂😂...they were probably trying to find..wait for it.......


OIL Agreed. I think the movie would be vastly improved if the disaster didn’t strike in the first 30 seconds and we got 5-10 mins or so of setup. \>Elven Ripley  


FTFY She should get more action roles, with better material to work with.  I think that she could pull it off. I don’t think she did kill it, “you have 60 seconds” I think implied that she wanted it to get away. Glad I wasn't the only one that had trouble understanding the dialogue at some parts. Or it could be that our theater's speakers suck. Do you by chance know what Nora said at the end before the explosion? Not the narration, what she actually said out loud. I loved the scene where the creature swallows kristen stewart whole and she tears out of it. The effect of the jaws simply going for with abandon was great. > >!""Those pods were going pretty fast, I don't think the monsters could have caught them so why did Norah have to blow herself up?""!<

Deep-sea divers have to ascend slowly in order to avoid [the bends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness), which can cause permanent brain damage or death (or any number of other horrible injuries). Maybe the escape pods were designed to ascend slowly & safely.

But then, it's physically impossible for the human body to withstand pressures above a few hundred meters deep, and they were 7 miles down. So every suit and structure in the movie must have been pressurized, which is utterly impossible with current materials. So maybe I should stop trying to analyze the physics of a horror movie lol. There were rumors that this was, at some point in the early phases, going to be a Cloverfield prequel. So I think your questions about the Captain and the station may have just been leftovers from that. In the Cloverfield ARG it's revealed that >!the drilling station was actually a secret research station to study the creature(s) that they had discovered there, before everything went sideways.!< Even if it's not/never was Cloverfield related, that may still be the implied explanation in some version of the script/director's head. >!I remember them lingering on the map in Lucien's office and there was a circle mark around the station and what appeared to be a pentagram symbol scribbled onto it. I wonder if Lucien had been warned before hand and just ignored it or was ordered to ignore it?!< T.J. Miller only plays one character in all his movies and that character is T. J. Miller He did. Odd way to establish their existing rapport, but eh it worked. Edit, spelling I was the only one laughing lol That's an accurate description of her, which explains why I'm completely enamored with her. Well he ain't wrong lol

The GI Jane haircut totally works on K Stew. I was pretty much crushing on her the whole movie. My fiance and I heard ""Sweet, flat-chested almond creature"" but tbh this makes more sense. I saw a q+a with the cast and one of the funny things the bearded guy said was that when they were filming in the suits he was making basically no acting decisions. It was just like okay run over there and that would take all his effort in the suit. The gears of war underwater suit. It was indeed a nice suit I was thinking how cool they are during the movie. They really look heavy and sophisticated, as they should be. IRL atmospheric diving suits look amazing too. They reminded me of 40k space marine armor! Straight up power armor yo They looked a lot like the Terran space marine suit from Starcraft. My first thought when i saw those was Adam Savage getting his hands on those and geeking the F out.  lol I mean it was a HUGE elder god type creature. This “theory” makes some of that stuff easier to digest. I kept wondering why the Hell they would allow anyone access to over load and blow the power source lol. I know there were hints that the higher ups knew about the creatures before, but the UI for the self destruct system and blast radius was still a little much for me. I think overall the movie was pretty good, but that seemed a little too convenient. Although maybe those red lights at the final drill station were scanners looking for “approaching” things. Maybe I’m being too harsh on it. Still really enjoyed the movie. It’s no alien but it’s damn solid. If she sat with one of them, they all will be killed by the monsters at the end, Kirsten saved them at the end. Lack of oxygen I would assume but I thought the same thing Very late to this thread, but Ad Astra was the worst movie I saw last year. It all felt so pointless. There really wasn’t any spectacle either. I literally don’t even remember the plot outside of Tommy Lee Jones ship going to destroy the earth and Brad Pitt has to stop his dad? It was a train wreck. That was my wife's reaction to KStew, yes. Should receive a 10/10 on the Moist Meter by that logic. nom nom Kinda interesting that TJ Miller and John Gallagher Jr were in this considering they were leads in Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane How would you feel if this was Cloverfield Paradox instead of that other film?

I kinda wish Netflix had bought this one instead. Seems they were attached to it. Not sure. Kind of like remoras to sharks. I thought the big one was the Alpha or Queen, and the others were just part of the swarm/colony. Not Cthulhu-like. According to the director, it literally *was* Cthulhu Classic Lovecraftian creature It would have really triggered me if I got a better shot at it. Luckily it was dark. I thought it was Cthulhu, but yeah I wanted him to win was pretty sad tbh I joked that this could be a stealth Lovecraft film and I was right Yea, I'm one of those. I only speak in jokes...the more stress, the more jokes. Wastes water. Astronauts swallow the whole thing when they brush their teeth.

Granted they had sinks and such down there, but still, maybe Kstew was an astronaut and wanted as far away from space as possible. I didn't see/notice either of them :/ I'm right there with ya! This was great! The scene that got me the most was the POV from below of the station exploding. That shit felt *real*. I really enjoyed it.  I liked that they didn't waste any time. No build up for 30 min that's here are the characters, this is the picture place they work.  

Just right into it. That took you a while. Haha. I laughed when that happened.  Never seen that happen before That scene got a solid laugh out of me. Punching her in the face then apologizing haha.

Best part of the movie was how real everyone felt. Even T.J. Miller, who maybe felt a tad overly jokey, still felt like a fairly realistic “guy with a dark sense of humor”. Didn't that happen 19/20ths through the movie? Dude yes!!! So many armchair critics are putting this movie down. But honestly whats bad besides maybe the cheesy self sacrifice ending that we've seen a bit too often. The sets were so interesting and reminiscent of Alien almost. The moster design was slick and still pretty scary. I absolutely loved the dialogue between everyone, it felt so natural and not overly dramatic. The pacing was kinda fast but in a holy fuck the action grabs you and start running. I didn't have trouble keeping track of whats going on. Overall I wasn't this satisfied by a January release since Den of Thieves. I loved it too! Didn't expect much out of it. The trailers reminded me of *Sphere* by Crichton, which I loved, so I decided to take a look. Turned out 10x better than I expected. 

My only complaint is that I'd have preferred for them to go with an original monster design rather than literal Cthulu. Dont count out a movie based on release date and rating (Pg-13) in this case The bunny being the reason they survived would’ve been the best thing ever ngl Thought the exact same thing. I've been around enough industrial machinery to know that safety mechanisms to keep the user from doing anything catastrophically wrong are plentiful. Why on earth is it possible for just anyone to use 3 fingers on a touch screen to blow up the entire facility? Loved the movie but that part took me out of the moment a bit. Nitpicking here, but I think the company was called ""Tian."" Which would make sense, since the Captain was French. For me it was more than passable, I loved it! Strongest film of it's type since Pandorum. Favorite movie of this kind since Cloverfield for me Had a good mix of Lovecraft, some closter-phobia (not even gonna attempt to spell that correctly), shaky cam, dope music from Marco Beltrami in a couple of scenes, some scary shit, some really cool shots (similar to The Signal if you've seen that, the director's other movie)... all around solid 7/10 movie, honestly. I hadn't thought of that angle until you mentioned it. I thought the  company was just greedy capitalism in motion and the captain had an inkling about what all the strange phenomena and sightings were. I kinda like that it’s minimally in there; keeps the main story focused while still introducing those elements that explain a ton yet also not going so deep that it still keeps the audience wanting more. Gives a nice extra layer. Wow great angle! Would have loved for them to expand on that Pretty sure this movie was shot over two years ago because he's been unhirable for years now. Doesn't he have a pretty severe brain injury hence why he went crazy? He was my favorite part of the movie. oooo that twist would've been nice especially with >!the reveal of Cthulu. Like a Cabin in the Woods type reveal.!< I was really hoping something would be revealed like an event that occurred at the abandoned drill station. >It seemed like they’d have this cool twist at the end where things aren’t really what they seemed but it never came

See to me, that's the kind of twist I hate. I prefer the fact that it was an actual monster movie. Would love to see a sequel  and explore more of what was found Yeah I was really hoping for that. That would’ve really been the icing on the cake if the movie had followed through on some crazy psychological stuff. So much was laid out and then didn’t come to anything. But I still enjoyed the movie. 

I was also hoping for a closing of that Moon Pie thing. I wanted Smith (?) to give Emily that freakin Moon Pie at the end! Do people really hate TJ Miller?

I fuckin love that guy. He's supposed to be abrasive.

Paul is the audience. He's meta, he closes the door, he cares about Smith's kid, and mostly he doesn't treat the situation as seriously as the other characters even though its life or death. 

Hes a pressure release for the audience, so the movie doesn't blow it's INTENSITY load, a la the marvel films, guy ritchie movies, etc. The tone of the scenes Paul are in, are demonstrably different in that they never let the pedal get to the metal so as to let later scenes be that much more impactful.

His jokes and idiocy are used to distract the other characters from the task at hand, and to help them just keep going. He's not just a comedic foil, he's also keeping the crew grounded without asking if they have a dog. 

Losing Paul as an act 1 closer, is used to show that there are no more distractions, you're going to live or die. Just because you're likeable or self-aware doesn't mean shit if you're dead, so KEEP MOVING OH MY GOD.

Also, he did more world building by taking off his shirt and having rapport then anything else in the movie. Also showed that to take that job, you gotta be fucking crazy.

Paul is the 2nd best character in this movie, following closely behind little Paul. His face is so punchable Yeah if they had named the drilling company Slusho instead, it could have been a cloverfield origin story I don't think that was a creepy drawing. I think it was just a hand-drawn blueprint of the rig set up down there. The painting shows the mer-creatures It was like she only had to click on the Destroy Core button and it didn't even ask ""are you sure?"" or anything like that. And to be the 2 who survive. I always try to call the order of who dies in these types of movies, got this one all wrong. Gunner Wright is even in it and he's Isaac in the Dead Space games! Good, so I wasn't the only one with underwater Dead Space vibes My dog takes shits better than The Grudge, so... >I REALLY liked that the characters weren't brain dead

Yep, there was no ""wtf are they doing?!"" moments *cough* the Grudge *cough* or ""Let's split up"".
I would've done pretty much the same choices as the characters. The director did a AMA for the movie and told that he actually played SOMA and loved it. So not a coincidence. Read the script and no twist. Only thing I think I could see was a cliffhanger? I think it’s implied the monsters were waiting outside of the glass . The script is still floating around and is still available, I looked it up after you mentioned it.


I skimmed a bit, and it seems like some of the basic beats are the same, but a lot of the dialogues and one name is changed. The final movie is definitely a lot more enjoyable. Not sure about what the twist is referring to tho. >was there a random octopus monster like halfway through after the captain gets dragged away

I took this as being an actual octopus, which is why it's not seen/talked about again. Just random sea life she encountered. We see hints in the Captain's locker.  He clearly has a Sketch of Cthulhu.  They didn't show a staff artist the picture of the Cthulhu idiol, from Lovecraft's notes and say: ""Make me a prop version of this, but different enough that it doesn't violate copyright laws.""  No, it was clearly [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cthulhu_sketch_by_Lovecraft.jpg) drawling.  This was so brief, though, that I don't blame people for missing it.  I am going to sit through the credits next time and see if I see a copyright notice.

I don't understand your being taken out of the mood by other creatures, since in real life, there's all kinds of creepy-crawlies that far down. The script had several different monsters the group was supposed to encounter that didn’t make it to the final film. Oddly enough the octopus wasn’t one of them. That makes sense... They're probably all types of fucked up underwater creatures not just thulu I don't have anything against Kristen Stewart, but when you do underwater monster movies you gotta go with big chested actresses. >  don't make any dumb horror movie choices. They act like real people would in their situation in a way not many horror movies reach.

I wasn't going to see the movie because of poor reviews (I have many movies on my watchlist with better ratings and only so much time) but this peaked my interest. > I can't think of another Kristen Stewart movie I've seen since Twilight.

She has been in several great movies since Twilight. Looked more like Dagon. The monsters were capable of catching up with the pods and did in fact get at least one, so chances are none of them actually made it. the monster slammed its fist down into something that cause whatever it hit to blow up. Someone said there were pentagrams on the map in the captain's locker? Personally I was studying the map pretty hard and didn't notice much, but maybe I missed it. It was a bit weird that they abandoned Shepherd Base when it seemed about as intact as the main base and it still had a lot of stuff in there. The captain also definitely seemed hesitant to go there, so I was certain there was some kind of big reveal there. His character that we see on screen might not have been an unlikeable guy, but judging by the Cthulhu imagery in his locker and the whole shadiness surrounding Tian, I think we can safely assume that he and his colleagues knowingly unleashed these monsters upon the world. I think this movie could have shined some more light on that. hunkered down in a safe space somewhere out there is a raging feminist majorly triggered by that Did you miss the part where the most heroic character was Kristen Stewart? Don’t see why you need to bring your clear personal bias into this. maybe the captain knows what the company is doing, hence the drawings in his locker, and he, and the other employees, are the offerings. I actually really liked it as well. Movie was not perfect but really no movie is especially now a days. But I really liked the vibe of the movie and how it fast paced it was. I kinda wish we got a better look at some of the monsters but I guess the whole darkness and shadows thing was part of the setting.

I really like movies like this where your not sure what its gonna turn into. Like I thought after they killed that 1 monster that maybe they would be fighting them. 

I think this movie is really underated and it was very unique story. Unlike most movies now a days that are all remakes.

I was wondering if you knew any movie similar to Underwater ? I cant really think of anything too similar. what? lmfao that's every movie baby Ngl that doesn't sound that bad. Maybe throw in some beers and a baked potato. Steak, homie My favorite line, ""Do you love him?"" ""Ya"" ""Cool"". I honestly walked in to kill a few hours thinking it would just be a good popcorn flick to switch off to.

I didn't expect this movie to perfectly cater to my preferences in horror/thriller nor did I expect to enjoy Kristen Stewart's performance, but it did and I did. Actual good movie. It was a nice change of pace to skip the “EVERYTHING’S FINE, THIS LAB WILL NEVER SINK” start of the disaster movie. When they heard a voice in the rubble and lifted up a rock to reveal TJ Miller's face, I swear my movie-going pal and I both turned to each other and said, ""Eh, it's only TJ Miller. Cover him back up."" It’s interesting people keep mentioning sunshine because I’m 70% sure the control room in this movie was the Icarus 2 bridge set. I think, just like the news clippings, that the company knew something was down there. Plus the captain was pretty adamant they couldn't even go to that station, which was a lie If you're curious about the creatures, look up H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos. Was it ever mentioned it's set in Lovecraft's universe? I mean I'm here thinking the Godmother was probably Dagon, but hey, if it actually is that's cool. I get the feeling the studio made some cuts to mask more of the cosmic horror that was in there to make it more “palatable” to general audiences. It’s the Elder Sign. This is a Lovecraft/Cthulhu movie. It felt like Dead Space + Alien to me. I got some doom vibes too. Loved the set designs >Dead Space

I was thinking more SOMA. Like, I couldn't get over how much this reminded me of that game. After watching this film I kinda wish Netflix bought this and attached the Cloverfield Paradox name to it instead of that other film. Kristen Stewart is fucking awesome :) She always has been in so many movies aside from Twilight. People don't usually hate on Stewart or Pattinson anymore.  That ship has sailed for anyone who has seen their more recent performances. Kristen Stewart was the main reason I saw this movie. I have a huge crush on her, and I'm not afraid to admit it anymore. She's great, and I have to love her and Pattinson because they hate Twilight as much as the rest of us. Kristen Stewart running around in her underwear. Good enough for me Didn't realize Stewart got pulled up to that platform with the captain at first. Thought it was just him lol. The editing left me a tad confused. > have made it easier to tell which character was which when they had the suits on. Something as easy as e

I ended up using the suit numbers they had printed on the chests.  It was still pretty easy to mix people up if you couldn't see it though. Ever played SOMA? Gave me tons of vibes from that game. [deleted] Her helmet was damaged, that fish-squid-man slammed her helmet on the ground and then tried to eat it. Haha! 

I totally got some subnautica vibes watching this movie. 
The shots of bases imploding were awesome. 81 days later......

- It was not an earthquake, it was an attack by the deep ones and Cthulu himself. 

- in lucian's locker you'll see not just the location of the drill that freed Cthulu, but two drawings. One is of a deep one and the other is an official drawing by Lovecraft of cthulu himself. 

- Lucian said the Sheperd was gone because that locker ties him to the Cult of Cthulu and directly implicates him to what's happening

- he did not know roebuck was infested but knew what it was digging and why

So, to break it down.

The ending credits show the company will resume the dig. We also know Lucian lost his friend and his daughter. The company he was employed by is a cult of cthulu and they were intentionally digging to find him and set him free. Lucian was most likely working with them because he was told that through the God he could have his daughter and friend back. An effect of Cthulu and awareness of him is insanity. People would often draw him from dreams. Which explains the drawings he had in his locker along with the map.

The pentagrams in the locker also imply ritual intentions. So he was most likely looking into a means to revive his lost daughter. He abandoned not just the Shepard but the memorial photo he had of his daughter. Which implies the Shepard, which was the first drill site, was inhabited solely by the cult of cthulu. Which is why the Roebuck is empty, as the majority of worshippers either willingly let themselves be taken or simply escaped on sight.

Either way, they're goal from the start was to free the God of madness and Lucian was very much aware.

Fun facts: the wall painting and the funny dudes chest tattoo are both cthulu as well. Yeah so fkn corny. Especially her little speech at the end.

'You lose sense of time in the dark, sO lEtS lIgHt tHiS sHiT uP!!1!' Everyone in Kristen stewarts section of the ship died When she sealed the door.

Just a nice plot thing I noticed. The captain says he helped get 20 other people out via escape pods when we meet him.

In the end credits it's shown that there were only two official survivors.

Its basically confirms that the creatures killed everyone who took those escape pods. There was speculation elsewhere in the comments that Tian knew about the creature (supported by the intro and the cover-up after the movie) and included that as a fail-safe. Personally I think it was just a case of Norah having enough familiarity with the facility to destroy it on her own, though. I believe it had been mentioned earlier on that the core meltdown was a possibility due to the earthquake, so she probably just took advantage of the damage to the system. All she did was crank up the power, after all. Yea these scores and that it bombed sucks ... I really liked everything about it! I agree but tbf I think his character was supposed to be awkward. I mean he's talking to a bunny plush... It's hinted in the newspaper scenes that this isn't Tian Industries first run in with these creatures so those features may have been added intentionally. Holy shit, i didn't even connect that. I can see it ""sensing"" something once Nora started pumping up the energy. There was a line about the small thing not having eyes, but it followed the light. So I guess they can sense energy or something. She had to blow the station and fry the creatures for the two pods to reach the surface so we can safely assume that all escape pods prior were intercepted said creatures. Good catch. It means none of the other pods made it. That's a dark af detail. She just made him slip. 

A punny explosion like that cannot hurt the dark lord. Wait it was seriously PG-13? Stewart literally swiped a guy’s chunk of jaw away from her helmet at one point. Came here for this very reason, I'm guessing because the film was so poorly edited with cut to's that they missed something out, the guy clearly sees the helmet damaged, and gives it to her purposely to like try and save his own skin which is what the scene implies, like he's struggling with what to do and eventually gives it to a person without a helmet already. 

Cut to a few mins later and he has the helmet for some reason? And then they shoehorned in about him knowing the helmet was damaged.

Did he change his mind and grab the helmet back? And it just ended on the cutting room floor like so much of the film seemed to. I'm speculating that the necklace was given to her by her late fiance. And is reaching for it as a coping mechanism. Just a point on the suits, I think they *had* to be some kind of powered exoskeleton. Even if you could move the suit without help, moving in that kind of water pressure would be almost impossible (around 15,000lb/in^2).

I agree with everything else though.  Weird that somehow there's a tunnel collapse that doesn't break the stations outer hull, even when the rest of the station is imploding. I was honestly pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's a guilty pleasure movie, and it did it well. The underwater effects were top notch. And +1 for the heavy mechy suit design [deleted] What monsters did we miss out on from the script? Genuinely asking, I haven’t read the script. Also where the hell do people keep finding these scripts? I feel like every other film I see there is someone in the comments talking about differences from the script. Fully agree. The cthulu style design felt so real. One of the best parts of the original alien movie is that you get 30 minutes of the crew and seeing how they act. The crew with the exception of the captain was just a variation of panic. I wish Norah kept a bit more level headed, almost militaristic. I think she was dead, and the card was like a ""In loving memory of"" sort of thing She's dead but he didn't tell her b4, he mentioned her age when she died which surprised her, and then she found the ""in her memory"" picture and understood. She REALLY pulls off the short hair here! I think she looks even more sensational with long hair but she looked radiant here The giant monster is revealed near the last 20 or so minutes of the film and makes semi-regular appearances before the end If you aren't reading at Mach speed during the opening credits you're gonna have a bad time. Still, even if you don't read all that it's pretty clear what the premise is (they're miners of something valuable/important on the ocean floor and their station is exploding for some reason) and the journey is finding out what is doing the exploding and also trying to survive. Not exactly a complex scenario, I personally much preferred their approach of diving (heh) straight into it vs. 20 minutes of bland exposition and character intros like every other monster movie, or hell, most movies in general. Felt extremely fresh, and they did a good enough job of characterization  that I felt we got to know them well enough during the movie vs. getting it all dumped at the beginning like usual. i agree. they made a lot of fucking noise in the bottom of that ocean without any of the monsters except only one attacking them at any point. Kristen Stewart even walked right into a Giant Squid and spooked it. also it is implied that the huge elder god monster isnt actually from the bottom of the ocean if you pay attention to the drawings all over the old station. it seems to have been in a tomb of some kind or dimensional gateway. He gets incapacitated before the halfway mark, but is a main character still. He's pretty charming in his role although he has less dialogue than the other characters. >!From what I understood (and the characters said) after the creature crushed/ripped his leg it basically ""pulled"" his entire body through his suit (leg opening)...making him a jello.!< ""It ripped him right out of his goddamn suit."" I sat through the credits, I don't remember this. I just remember some stupid, forgettable out-of-place pop song playing. Man, it's almost like they were at the bottom of the ocean or something. I also had lots of problems hearing dialogue on this one. Strange that pretty much everyone else is saying the exact  opposite. This honestly was a better Cloverfield movie than Cloverfield Paradox. Why they forced that one to be a Cloverfield movie instead of this will remain forever a mystery. The creatures even looked the same! Exactly my thought “Resources” they were too secretive to be just mining resources on top of that they pretty much scrubbed every thing and made their stories classified information and then proceeded to start rebuilding the drill ""We're sorry...sorry...sorrrrrrry."" Yeah I was surprised how fast things moved, def makes me want to learn more about the world behind all this I forget if this was out loud or narration, but she says ""Now let's blow this shit"" (shit or ship but I think shit) I loved that scene it was, to me any way, sorta a reverse chest burster from Alien. I wonder if it was an intentional illusion to that. Really cool film! That was the first part of the movie that game me the true ""Lovecraftian Horror"" feeling. Seeing that things creepy long limbs, standing over her swallowing her whole - plenty of heebyjeebys. Loved how she shot the things spine out too. Not a diver, but to my knowledge you won't get the bends being in a pod because you're exposed to the same pressure the whole time.  The sea pressure is all on the outside of the pod so nitrogen isn't being forced into your bloodstream. That doesn’t really make sense; Underwater is a Fox film, Cloverfield is a Paramount franchise. There was also Cthulhu statue on pedestal drawn on the map. Which confirms that they knew about the creatures maybe even searching for them actively. Certainly made a lot of unfulfilled hints rapport :) Absolutely based I love that she was barefoot the entire time ! I saw that same Q&A at Alamo, it was really endearing to hear the cast complain about the process but be satisfied with the final product. Those suits looked cumbersome as hell! I’m so glad they didn’t hold back. Apparently Jessica Henwick's suit weighed almost as much as she does and it was poorly fitted so all the weight went on one shoulder and pinched a nerve. She ended up wearing a neck brace for a while. YES!!! That’s exactly what I looks like!!! Straight up Suit Porn I can totally see that! I personally saw [Star Craft Space Marine](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9c/1f/c0/9c1fc0cd94f00c3e92ba3348efd2484b.jpg) suits. I totally thought like oh... a Gears of War seems totally believable now.  You don't need crazy muscle bound dudes, these suits will take care of it. I liked when Nora shouted 'ears' and Paul tried to put his fingers in his ears but couldn't reach so he just goes, 'ah fuck it.' The studded shoulder pads reminded me of the early “beaky” space marine armors. Yea, my first thought was ""wow, this plot device is so 90's...anyone can just blow the reactor?""  Then I realized that the terminal to do this is ***in the same room as escape pods.***  And the countdown was what, 60s?  About how long it took for the pods to get out of range.  Too much lines up for me to think it was just lazy writing -- from the station that was ""lost"" being fully functional and has charts tracking the monsters, the captain not being surprised when they first make contact. I was about to say that there was no way of knowing they’d attack the pods, but then I remembered she was going to attempt to fix the pod given her sad look back at it before proceeding with the self destruct sequence. I am very late to this comment but I wholeheartedly agree, I hated that movie 10 Cloverfield Lane came out in 2016. This was filmed in 2017, but release was delayed with Disney buying Fox. Cloverfield Paradox came out in 2018. 

Definitely seems like it could've been planned to be a Cloverfield movie and then they pulled the idea after Paradox did poorly. The only thing Cloverfield movies have in common is the name and having weird creatures so I could definitely see it. Paradox was one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. That’s not exactly how it works. Netflix only got paradox because they knew it wasn’t good enough for theaters. I kinda hope they were coming in and out of the thing, it would make it way creepier. It made me think of this [toad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ7b4spjXhw) Like those lil creatures on the Cloverfield monster Always fun to see modern day Lovecraft influences in movies Yeah, the director said the main monster was designed on Cthulhu! Yeah that scene was great!  

People burying this movie cause it was delayed and being released in January sucks.  Dont review a movie on paper. When she got swallowed, that awoke a fear inside me I wasn't ever aware of! That was the worst part. Who cares what these characters are going through if we know nothing about them or their relationship or what they're doing? It's all just mindless spectacle That's been a common trope in action/war movies since WWII. The hero insists on going down with the ship or whatever, but the sidekick knows he has a woman waiting back home, so he punches him out and throws him in the life raft or something.

First time I ever saw it happen with two women though. Per the monster, at least a movie finally gave us an Elder God not just teased one.  I’m looking at you Cabin in the Woods.  Yes yes The Ritual I know. Right, which made it more aggravating that they showed her hot wiring and jury rigging stuff. Do that to for the core meltdown. Really seemed lazy to me when they even seemingly set that up I think I did hear the big drill at the end was called a “Titan Class” drill, but yeah company was defs Tian it could be a good name for a cult, tian means heaven in chinese. My biggest complaint about the film is that I wanted more from it, so I guess that's a good sign.  I just wish there was some character development and normal life aboard the rig stuff, like 30 minutes of just building the characters and establishing the environment before the shit hits the fan. God I loved pandorum. Just creepy as hell atmosphere. I’m excited(cautiously) for the event horizon series on amazon

Sidenote, I would say Annihilation loosely falls into the same category and that was very good. claustrophobia Yup, filmed in spring 2017 and was stuck in post because of Disney buying Fox. The dude screwed himself over, sexual allegations and a fake bomb threat.. dumbass. Yep filming was in the April-May of 2017 all the charges and stuff with Miller were late 2017 and 2018.   So good reason this film had such a delayed release. Nah it was just an undiagnosed issue that got fixed with brain surgery I personally thought that it was implied that Shepherd Station was abandoned because that is where they originally broke through and released the creatures.  The captain knows there is something out there, lies about Shepherd not being there anymore, and has a sketch of the big one in his locker on Shepherd. I'll give him this. His character in that Transformers movie made me want him dead within about 30 seconds. Big fan of Tj Miller, lol fuck me right? Tagruato is the company that drilled for the ingredients for Slusho. I could have sworn I saw some hand drawn pictures of the faces and figures of the smaller monsters on the paper as well. Well the black guy died first so they got that right at least.... I actually liked the grudge Awesome! I was halfway expecting spider crabs to be surrounding the mouth of the tunnel when dude got dragged away, it was so much like the game. Even the monsters (at first). The end of the script is Nora sitting in an observation dome of sorts and noting that the small mite-like creatures sitting on the glass look like stars. It was definitely no octopus I've ever seen. Could be just more undiscovered life or was an actual monster...who knows. Lovecraft works are public domain now, right? They probably wouldn't fit in those suits, unlike Stewart. I usually hate horror movies for this exact reason; I only went into this one because it appeared to be more sci-fi than horror.  Couldn't find an example throughout the film in which I would have done something differently than what the characters did, they are pretty much forced into taking the steps they take so I was happy to see some actual logic in a movie like this. Same thought I had. Plus the smaller monsters seemed more like Deep Ones which I believe are followers of Dagon. I also don't remember ever hearing of Cthulu having his minions crawl out of his body like that, though, that and his appearance could've just been the film maker taking some artistic liberty with the designs. aah, ok ok, good point. Elder signs, not pentagrams but symbols for Cthulhu. The company knows *something* is down there that isn’t natural. That’s why they cover it up and go back to drilling at the end. Raging feminist here and I loved that line.  It wasn't funny because she was a woman or whatever, it wasn't politically incorrect, it was funny because she was the inexperienced scientist who had never worn a deep sea diving suit and everyone else were experienced miners/divers.  That was the joke, ya gender obsessed weirdos.  

I usually don't respond to threads this old but I saw the movie tonight and wanted to see what others had to say about it, because I quite liked it, and this comment was just so ridiculous I had to respond. What you a vampire or something? Specifically Dagon and the Deep Ones. The 10 seconds of eldritch drawings and conspiracies in the beginning and end definitely point to Lovecraft. Yep, the captain likely intended to find Cthulhu as he was probably a worshipper Would be kinda weird with TJ Miller being in Cloverfield as well. Oh trust me I still see plenty of ""she can't show expressions"". You should see the youtube comments under every review of this movie. Those disco ball guys still give me fucking PTSD She was easily one of the better parts of Iron Fist. That's a good interview, I had no idea she had an accent. And what a happy smile. 7-8 tons per square inch. Her helmet was built like a tank. Damaged / crippled / w.e. it’s a stretch. It was a fun time regardless. 81 days well worth the wait for that, thank you so much for taking the time to make my life make sense, you are so awesome I appreciate the shit out of you ! I know this is a bit late of a reply, but I agree with pretty much all of this because it does seem like they knew based on so many clues. Beyond the ones you mentioned, the rig and Shepard Station also had walls with padding shaped like stone columns and archways that looked like altars. The end credits explain that there were only two survivors, but the captain claimed he saved twenty plus with the escape pods. So, either that was a lie or those survivors were prevented from reaching the surface by Cthulu and the rest. >Its basically confirms that the creatures killed everyone who took the escape pods

Oh, I didn't get that. I was wondering why they said only 2 survivors, makes sense. Thanks. Oh yeah, that makes more sense given they go to investigate a distress signal from one of the pods. Yep! “PG-13 for sci-fi action and terror and brief strong language”. Honestly this may have been the scariest, goriest PG-13 movie I’ve ever seen. I swear this had to be an R-rated movie that Disney or Fox toned down a bit last min. People found the script from an early draft of the movie online through Google Docs. It’s [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/0B4WAKYzaXXq2VlU3UU4wblU1LWs) if you’re interested in reading. Now for the creatures. From memory,

- The Giant Crab: An enormous creature resembling a cross between a crab and a spider that kills Paul by slicing him with its leg.

- The Old Man: A large, humanoid, nearly skeletal creature that kills the Captain. I’m pretty sure the monsters in the movie are supposed to be this, albeit with some changes. The Old Man in the script was bioluminescent and had scraggly hairs covering its body. It was also apparently hunting Frilled Sharks which is neat.

- The Ghost: A creature that looks like a large floating mass of flesh with eyes that stalks Nora after getting separated from Emily. It reappears later having followed Nora and Emily into the Roebuck where Emily kills it before it can strangle Nora.

- The Behemoth: It was a colossal creature that Nora sees shortly before reuniting with Emily and Smith. They are able to see it at the same time which is how they end up finding each other. It was also said to have smaller creatures attached to it, so this was probably the early version of the Cthulu monster from the movie.

- The Shark: A bioluminescent shark as big as a bus that stalks Nora and Emily as they make the final sprint to the Roebuck. I do love the ending sacrifice she makes tho, I just wished they didn't put a voiceover in the scene, would have made it better. Also it was so clear that this was inspired by Alien. Even the one gawah shot they have at the start looks like a scene out of alien. And he >!does literally nothing but float around and then die in an explosion!< Awesome!! Do we get many good looks at the monsters? Thank you! Ah I love him That looked like a terrible way to go. ||At least his stuffed bunny made it out.||

Don't really care about T.J. Miller in real life, but he did a good job in the film and I liked his character. Ah that sounds right.  Thanks for the clarification! Yep. The implication was that the company (Tian, I think?) was just interested in the creatures. For some reason. But they didn't want anyone to know about it. The captain was definitely already aware of the creatures (he doesn't seem too surprised by them, he tells them that the Shepard station is gone, then later Norah finds it intact and with oxygen, THEN finds out that he was based there at some point in the past, his locker has a string theory map inside of it and most damning and interesting of all, a sketch of Cthulhu). Newspaper clippings at the beginning of the movie, predating the events of the film, make reference to the company trying to cover up ""anomalous readings"" and sightings of creatures from people on the station. Right. Which means everything we saw in the whole movie was pressurized. Which has its own issues (e.g. how they hell did they maintain a pressurized structure that big 7 miles underwater), but hey, I'm not going to ask for too much realism in a movie about Cthulu lol Maybe Fox had intentions to sell it to another studio. Isn’t that how Netflix wound up with cloverfield paradox? Don't know why I clicked that. For anyone else who had the misfortune of watching this clip: 

/r/Eyebleach I think they were just like that. this brings me joy It's not like he could say anything else! Yeah review it on the web! But actually, anything that could've been said in those scenes comes through during the adventure. What else do you need to know? I liked the break neck pace. I feel doing a normal world before the disaster would've dragged the movie down. I was happy with it because typically they show it as the character getting knocked out and going to sleep for exactly as long as the plot requires, never waking up with brain trauma. This time Emily gets socked in the face and is just too stunned to react as Norah launches the pod. No safe nap punch in this movie. I've never seen them say sorry. Kristen Stewart's apology after punching her felt genuine. I mean it’s HEAVILY implied that the company Titan has had previous encounters with the creatures so it easily could be a safeguard due to the blast radius chart.

But more than anything it wasn’t just a hey let’s press this self detonation. It shows her removing the core safeguards, raising the internal temperature, and then igniting it under not safe conditions. Triton Class. I kinda liked that it dealt with the accident almost immediately. Just do away with the filler nonsense, build on the action right away and establish the rapport and chemistry of the survivors along the way. The movie isn't trying to be anything else but a gnarly,  fun creature feature B movie and that i think is its greatest strength. This is late as shit lol but THERES GONNA BE AN EVENT HORIZON SERIES??!!!?!?!? Doesn’t he have a cognitive disability now though? I thought I read before but not 100% sure if true that he got badly injured and fucked up his brain. Doesnt excuse any actions but if true maybe he needs help more than anything. Fixed by removing a portion of his brain, you know that right? There could've been and I just missed it. I do remember her looking at the diagram and then a little ominous music followed by a tone-shift to her becoming a ""tough woman on a mission"" to get to Roebuck. Hey, there was also tunnel girl and the hallway duo who died before him. Thats actually a rarity nowadays, since films are aware of that trope. I had respect for the film that they had to balls to go through that in this day and age! [removed] Very late to the party, but I just watched it, and yeah it was probably an unearthed monster of sorts, it had normal tentacles, and then another set of tentacles coming from underneath the main ones. So yeah, definitely not your run-of-the-mill octopus. Kinda funny how it had like 2 seconds of screen time, never to be seen again. I was sure I saw a ""normal"" pentagram like used in satanism. With a baphomed/goat head inside...

Not the elderly bend pentagram used in lovecrafts fiction Just came to this thread after watching the movie on a whim, this is funny to see lmao Just saw the movie and that's actually sick I'm really glad I could help provide some closure. You're very welcome. Np.

When this comes out on blue ray it'll deffs be worthwile to freeze frame some of the intro and end credits.

Also the scene where their prepping to go outside I think has part of it cut. I think the black guy purposely gave himself a faulty helmet. He's the one that gives Kristen Stewart her helmet and after he dies she says he knew it was faulty or something.  There might have been a scene cut for time that showed he knew his was broken. >!During the monologue she mentioned not have a sense of time or sense of reality i wish the played off of this with the creatures making it seem like she was imagining these monsters or something!< but sadly they didn't. i know this is two years old but they even had the iconic computer sound from the nostromo near the begining of the film which i took it as a nod saying yes we are toatally inspired by ridleys style and dedicate it to you. He attack Roebuck Station trying to get at a scantily clad Kristen Stewart. Don't forget that. Once they’re done teasing the monster you get a few good shots of them. It takes a while to finally see them but later in the last 20 minutes you see hundreds of them and the mom. Damn, I missed a lot of this / didn’t connect it together. I thought the map just said 'proposed roebuck station' or something along the lines. I didn't catch the Cthulhu drawing, though!! Little bit of a necro in response to your Underwater comment, but there was also an upside down pentagram in his locker. Yess, I had to pause it several times but the captains locker is most revealing. If you see the drawings under the map not only was there a drawing of the creature there was also an upside down pentagram as in what they were doing was almost ritualistic. Shit you right. I thought he said Shepard station was gone cause of the explosions but shit that’s a good catch ""Thank goodness we invented the blah blah blah device that lets us maintain pressure at 7 miles deep"" I totally thought they would be safe inside the railway structure because of the monsters surviving outside but, yeah. I'm straight up not having a good time with that Not to mention that the characters were already concerned about the core melting down, which was one of the time pressures. Norah didn't cause it, she just sped it up. He had a golf ball sized tumor removed from his frontal lobe. I haven’t read that it caused a disability or that it was from an injury 

Apparently it was a brain malformation 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_arteriovenous_malformation copying my comment from an old thread:

He had a malformation in his brain that was undiagnosed until 2011, when it caused a series of serious seizures. In 2010 TJ had begun displaying erratic behavior which would later be attributed to an internal bleed caused by the malformation. By 2012 (I can’t find the actual date) he underwent a surgery to remove the golf ball sized portion of his frontal lobe that was bleeding and malformed. According to him he asked the doctors if the procedure would affect him mentally, and was told it “shouldn’t” since that part of his brain wasn’t working anyway.

So the brain surgery happened before most of his success. Silicon Valley didn’t start filming until 2014, and his career really took off shortly thereafter.

So it’s possible his newly erratic behavior is the result of a new bleed or some other complication, but there hasn’t been any news about that. It’s also possible he’s just generally “off” due to being without a golf ball sized chunk of his frontal lobe, and if so that’s been the case for a long time (either since birth/childhood or from his surgery 8 years ago). [deleted] Yeah, it’s hard because you can’t say it’s an excuse for his behavior but they remove part of his brain that was responsible for decision making. The only this part of your brain does this and that is an oversimplification because other parts share parts of and take over function, but he’s seriously impaired And she had that really disgusted look on her face. That's why I thought it was so odd that there wasn't any further investigation into it. Or those two crewmen running towards the bulkhead door that Norah had to lock. They were the first, technically. That could be, or it could be intentional. I like how we learned more about characters after their sacrifices. Like dude letting her live by switching helmets or the revelation about the captains daughter. Also plays into the theme of feeling helpless. Yes, the intro/ending with the newspapers headlines were a bit too fast. There was too many things to read.

That company (Tian?) looks evil af tho, reminds me of Umbrella Corp.

>I think the black guy purposely gave himself a faulty helmet

Yes, I think so too. He looked stressed. He picks up the helmet, and sees the crack in it. Then it shows him giving her a helmet, without showing us if it is the one with the crack. Then his death confirms he kept it himself. It goes by very fast, and the movie itself moves very fast. I didn't even catch all of this myself. My wife noticed some of it, and I noticed some that she didn't. We put it all together after we got out of the theater. Now I gotta go back and check that scene out again. 

Shame this flopped so hard. I really enjoyed it and it seemed like there was potential for really cool lore. I thought he said it was gone cause he didn’t want them to find out about his daughter. Didn’t notice the drawing. Can’t wait to watch it again and look for this stuff. Exactly Yep, any deep-sea creature entering any pressurized structure should have blown up like a balloon. Well the core already blew in their drill station if I remember correctly, I think the other station was uninhabited for whatever reason Holy shit 

That probably has a lot to do with his mental state. It's not hard. It's an excuse because he literally had no control over what he was doing. There were a couple scenes where her emotions just didn't seem to line up with the plot for some reason. A couple scenes felt off tonally to me.

I'd have to watch it again to see the drawings. I do remember her being sad when finding out cap's daughter had died at 14 and then I *thought* she looked at the diagram drawing and had her 'strong woman' moment. Yeah I found the pacing, especially on the front end, to be very snappy without feeling rushed. When they were at the midway station the walls had weird alien-esc carvings on them as well. It stuck out to me cause it was like some drill command station with carved stone walls for some reason. [Here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cthulhu_sketch_by_Lovecraft.jpg) is the drawling.  It is Lovecraft's sketch of an idol of Cthulhu,.  I believe that her wo-manning up might have been after looking at the statue, but that doesn't mean that looking at the statue caused it.  I believe that you are right, and she decided to take action after seeing the Captain's daughter.  

That, or seeing the idiol drove her slightly insane, a kind of madness that manifested itself in an urge to fight against impossible odds, rather than stay in the station.  🤤 I think she realized the Captain wasn't telling them everything. He says he launched 22 pods in the beginning, presumably before things got too out of control, but at the end only the two survived. He also said Shepherd Station was gone, when it most assuredly wasn't. And the way he *insisted* the two guys inspect the body when everyone knew it was clearly dead and time was of the essence. And then the whole ""My daughter is 14"" then Norah saying she must be 20 by now implies Norah knew him for a while, and found it odd he still said she was 14. 

If you ask me, I think Tian corp has known about, and been searching/studying the creatures. The Captain knew about it, Shepherd station was a forward operating base, and didn't want anyone to know about it or what they found. He didn't launch any escape pods or evacuate any crew because he needed to get to the drill to overload it. The drill was deliberately designed to also be a big ass bomb for just such an occasion.

Small point but was that a program for the captains daughter’s funeral in in his locker? It had her age of 14 on it, so I took it to mean she died at 14, which is why he still thought of her as that old but he hadn’t told Norah. Yeah pretty much. She had been dead for a long time, and told Norah about her a while ago (6- odd years since Norah said his daughter must be 20ish by now) but neglected to mention she was dead. So for at least six years, he's been pretending his daughter was alive. Not a super sane dude. ",0
138,"""This isn't real enough for you, Billy? *I'm* not real enough for you?
It was real enough for Georgie!""

Low blow, Pennywise. I liked how when Georgie laughed really hard at the pop! pop! pop! popcorn impression that IT does, like REALLY laughed and wasn't afraid at all for a second, IT just totally 'went offline' and stalled and one eye wandered. Like he entertained the kid a little TOO well and created joy and love and it shut him down for a second. one thing that took me by surprise tone-wise with this movie is that Muschietti really turned it into kind of a dark fantasy adventure movie instead of a gritty horror flick. it had a certain fairytale element to it that I thought was stupid in Mama but really worked in IT. just an immensely enjoyable film, tons of fun. The way the shot centered on Pennywise's face when he was dancing in the lair was so fucking unsettling. Of all the losers, the standout in my opinion was Sophia Lillis as Bev. She really nailed the interpretation of her I had from the book, that mixture of brassy confidence and maturity for her age with her, I guess, demons - an overly handsy father and her reputation as a slut (something not in the book, and a change I liked). The scene were she joins them at the quarry and the boys just stare at her while she suntans is great. And holy fuck, her father was so incredibly creepy. The scene where he locks her in their apartment and confronts her is just...there's no Pennywise (till the end) but it's so tense. I was surprised (and impressed) how far they took that subplot from the book.

Hamilton as Bowers was really good! His whole gang was underused, and I was disappointed with their being no payoff for Vic and Belch, and with Patrick just being a more...generic bully, but the scene were Bowers kills his father, being egged on by the TV, is outstanding. 

And finally, Skarsgård. He was amazing as Pennywise. He did his own thing with the character. He really nailed my interpretation of him from the book, that despite being a malevolent being thousands of years old he's a child in many ways, and a spoiled one whose had his way with Derry for so long. Watching him break down as the Losers fight back is so cathartic. He comes off as an emotionally stunted pedophile in many ways.  I like how Pennywise grabbed the kid with the broken arm and twice pretended like he was going to bite his arm off.  Georgie's death scene was a lot more brutal than I expected. Good Lord ""I need my bifocals. They're in my second fanny pack"" 

Line of the movie That garage projector scene was some of the most intense shit I've seen in a long damn time. I jumped out of my fucking seat when Pennywise popped through the projector  The television kids show sequences. ""Come play in the sewers!"" Good god, those were creepy.  Can we take a moment to appreciate how much effort they went to in referencing the book, even when it didn't serve the story?

They had Silver. They had The Black Spot. They had the Paul Bunyan statue. They had the turtle. They had the deadlights. There were just so many small details that showed a real love and respect for the source material. Seems like they kept Mike in the story just for that gun. Holy shit that weird tracking shot of Pennywise dancing that focused on his head was super wacky. My favorite scene was the part where Ben was flipping through the pages of the history book and the librarian was just lurking creepily at the back not moving at all. I expected her to transform into Pennywise any second.  That Lois Lane line was vile. The entire theater groaned at that one. The worst thing about this movie is that it's really hard to google anything about it because of the title. I love the scene where Pennywise is just casually eating a child's arm, stops, and then uses the arm to wave at the kids. ""This town used to be a beaver trapping camp""
""It still is boys, am I right??""  Bill finally realizing after the entire movie that Georgie is dead and there is nothing that he can do about it was crushing. A surprisingly heartwarming film about how a clown helps a group of kids overcome their fears and realize the power of friendship. Great for the whole family.  The jumpcut to close ups of the New Kids on the Block poster, the acknowledgement from Ben and Bev, and then the cut back to the ominous tone was so weird, yet I absolutely loved it.
 ""You'll float too. You'll float too. YOU'LL FLOAT TOO"" as Georgie's voice changes and his face decays. Nightmare fuel!  I loved the part when Henry insults Bev and Ben just screams at him like a maniac. Did not expect Georgie's fuckin arm coming off wtf New Kids On The Block poster scene >>> The Gazebo line had me in stitches Though I didn't really think it would happen, in the back of my mind I was worried that Georgie actually WAS alive and It had tricked Billy into killing him himself. That would have reached The Mist level of messed up endings. My entire theatre groaned with disgust when the creepy pharmacist said that Beverly looked just like Lois Lane. Somehow a standout creepy moment in a movie about a killer clown.  Can we just take a moment and give it up to Ben, who got gut slashed not once, but twice, only to get patched up in an alleyway by an unlicensed doctor, like a BOSS! I don't care if he listens to new kids on the block, that fucker is hardcore.  THESE ARE GAZEBOS Yo...when the kids shined the light on the painting lady sucking on that kid's face, that was absolutely terrifying. Fuck that shit dude.  Did you notice the casual mention of a turtle in the swimming scene?

MATURIN THE TURTLE CONFIRMED  As I walked out, a mom was with her what looked to be 8-10 year old son, and she asked him ""Well, what did you think of your first scary movie?""

Lady, this is one hell of a first scary movie, especially for a kid his age. A 6 year-old gets his arm eaten off in the first 5 mins.  You punched me, made me walk through shitty water, dragged me through a crackhouse... **and now I'm gonna have to kill this fucking clown.**

Edit: first gold! The part with Pennywise waving the dismembered kids arm was so unsettling. Surprised no one else has mentioned that yet.  There is after credit audio. You hear the clown laughing.  Them actually showing Georgie losing his arm really set the tone for the rest of the movie. Holy shit that was terrifying.  ""Ain't nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble"" holy shit the way that line was delivered was goosebumps. The scene where Georgie sees the two ""eyes"" in the basement really fucked me up right off the bat. My basement terrified me as a kid and that visual struck a nerve with me. 

Awesome film, really unsettling stuff left and right ""Do you need to be a virgin to see this fucking clown?""

-Richie the Savage Did anyone else notice the old lady in the background when Ben was in the library doing research on the town??

Also, Tim Curry Pennywise throw back in the clown room. The long-faced painting lady is going to ruin my life. ""THIS MOTHERFUCKER IS LEAKING HAMBURGER HELPER!""

Also, fuck the projector. Piece of shit. The part when Bill says he's more afraid to walk into his own house than the wellhouse.... damn.  When Eddie has to give his Mom a kiss and Richie goes ""Do you want one from me too Mrs. K?!"" had me dyinggggg cause that is absolutely something my friends would do when I was young. Billy: let's stick together and it can't defeat us
Also, Billy: runs away by himself  Does anyone have a screenshot of Finn Wolfhard flipping off that guy after he says ""Go blow your dad, you mullet wearing asshole""

EDIT: words That final fight when Pennywise is changing into everything was something else. What an amazing finale.

The burnt arms shoving their way out of his mouth was FANTASTIC Pennywise coming out of the fridge and The Projector Scene were straight up nightmare fuel for me, and that's all credit to Bill (Fuckin') Skarsgard and Andy Muschietti's fantastic direction with this film. I cannot wait to see what they do with the character when Chapter 2 releases! The jump scare after Bev hits her dad with the lid of the toilet. The theater went from a reaction of ""Yeah! Hit that abusive asshole!"" to immediate screams of terror. Great movie. ""This is the best feeling ever!"" 

""Try tickling your pickle sometime!""  Bill killed it as Pennywise, what a great adaptation. The projector scene and the fridge entrance were just so creepy. Loved the humor too. 9/10 adaptation, they did best we can realistically expect.  My theater had an argument escalate to a physical fight that led to half the theater evacuating and free movie passes being given out as people left.

Still one of the best theater experiences I've had.  When the bullies were beating up Mike and he glanced over and saw Pennywise waving hi with the severed arm, that was my favorite clip because it was funny yet so disturbing. Dear Director,

Please include my favourite giant turtle in the sequel

Thanks I think Finn Wolfhard stole the show in this movie. His comedic timing was fantastic, but his dramatic acting was also on point. His reaction to seeing his own missing poster was incredibly tense and definitely added layers to his character.

I found the opening scene and the first time the Losers enter 29 Niebolt Street (that fridge exit!) to be the scariest scenes in the film. Overall, I found the movie fantastic and a faithful adaptation to the source material. The scariest scene by far was when Ben was reading the history book in the library and the librarian was creepily smiling at him from afar out of focus.

I almost left the theatre at that part I love it when Pennywise tries to negotiate with the Losers over Bill's life. ""I could eat him up now, then disappear and you can all go on living wonderful happy lives."" Goes to show he had no idea what he was up against. I have no doubt that chapter 2 will be fine, but it's going to be odd not having those kids around. A large part of why the movie is so good is because of the losers club as kids.  Surprised I haven't seen this yet on here:    

The scene where Bev is being pulled into the sink with hair was fucking terrifying.     


As a book reader, 9/10.      

Beep-beep. Get off Reddit and go watch this fucking movie, so you can float too. We all float down here. Hey guys, in case you're interested, I've gathered a list of material that was apparently changed from the test screenings that were done early in the year. Here's what changed in the final cut: 

- Georgie's arm getting ripped off was shown in full, more bloody. Likely cut to avoid an NC-17 rating
- Rock fight was longer
- Henry Bowers murders Belch and Victor. EDIT: Specifically, there was apparently a short scene of Bowers approaching the Neibolt house. We see his car parked outside, where Belch and Victor lay in the back, throats slit.
- Richie's clown room was added in later/the final cut EDIT: The reason for this was most likely because in the book, the kids see a Teenage Werewolf film in the local theater. IT takes on this form in the Neibolt house in the book, and that's when we learn what Richie is afraid of. They likely added this because Richie needed more development of his individual fear of clowns.
- Additional Pennywise television clips
- Stan had a monologue that was cut
- Patrick's remains were shown

I'm still in the process of collecting info, but I find this interesting and wonder if we'll get an unrated cut on home release.
 Loved it! Bev stole the show and my heart, she was great and they did great things with her character. Pennywise was outstanding! He felt alien and just wrong in all the right ways. Every time he speaks it doesn't feel right, almost like it's trying to mimic something it witnessed or knows how it goes but wasn't made for it.

Also the deadlights. So good. I appreciated the fact that the movie actually showed what Pennywise meant when he referred to ""floating."" I never read the book and the made-for-TV movie never quite covered it. **THEY SHOWED THE DEADLIGHTS!**

The way they did that was probably one of my favorite parts, but Beverly shouldn't have been able to come back so easily.   The whole theatre was caught wildly off guard when Pennywise grabbed her in the bathroom after her dad got got. Good moment. A lot of people loving Richie, but no love for Eds? He was fucking hilarious!  [deleted] Got half cocked by the The Thing vibe with Pennywise's transformations near the end. Also, fuck that lady painting. After the colossal disappointment that was the Dark Tower, my favorite King book, I'm so happy to say they knocked this one out of the park Just want to talk about the bad guys in this movie for a moment. You have basically 3 bad guys and in their own right, each is equally terrifying. 

First of all, Skarsgard's Pennywise is instantly iconic. He did such an amazing job with this role. I loved every choice he made. Here's the thing - he really seemed like the multidimensional evil he is intended to be, taking the form of a clown, rather than an evil clown. A timeless, primal, evil force that has existed since the dawn of time (I guess an early Fukunaga script even had a pilgrim scene).

Then you had the bullies. What Stephen King always gets right about bullies is he takes them to a homicidal level. So it's not just the intimidation and fear, its the unpredictability that these guys could actually kill you. Same thing with the bullies in Christine, in Stand By Me, and probably others I can't even remember.

When you're a kid who is the target of bullying, it's scary enough to think you may get punched in the face or embarrassed in front of the school. But with King's bullies, these greasy bastards want to kill you with knives. 

Finally, EVERY adult in this movie was a ""bad guy."" From Bev's dad, to Eddie's mom, to Henry's dad, right down to the lecherous old pharmacist who wanted to fuck 15 year old Bev. These were not adults, these were Stephen King's adults and while King struggles with certain things, what he ALWAYS gets right are the bad guys.

What Muschietti got right with this movie was that the losers were united against ALL 3 of these elements throughout the movie. So it wasn't just a movie about evil clowns. Or getting terrorized by bullies. Or not being able to look to a good grown up for help. 

The bad guys in this movie didn't necessarily have fangs and claws. And I'm glad that Muschietti was smart enough to flesh that out. [deleted] The garage scene actually made my jaw drop and I don't remember the last time that happened in the theater. One of the coolest things I've seen put to film in ten years. Oh and

these
ARE
**GAZEBOS**  Since a few here have asked to be reminded of the magic of Richie here you go:


        


• You punched me, made me walk through shitty water, dragged me through a crack house and now I’m gonna have to kill this fucking clown


• Ben - Derry was started as a beaver trading camp. Richie - Still is, am I right, boys?

• Do you and your mom use the same toilet? Then you probably have crabs


• Go blow your dad you mullet wearing asshole


• Look at this motherfucker; he is leaking Hamburger Helper


• Do you need to be a virgin to see this fucking clown?


• As long as my wang? That’s pretty short


• Who invited Molly Ringwald?


• How did I draw the short straw? You are lucky this wasn’t a dick measuring contest Literally just walked out of the monster screen and checked here.

SO GOOD. SO much scarier than the original, so much better, so much everything! 

The scares got me good, the projector screen scene holy shit! When he bit Georgie's arm, holy shit!

Richie was the funniest character. Every scene he had, everyone laughed.

Overall *amazing!*



 I'm generally pretty good with horror films but this was genuinely quite scary in a variety of different types of scares.

One thing that stood out to me was how noticeably good the score was. A lot of recent big releases have had such boring scores or music that just blends into nothingness but this managed to capture wonder, fear, action and tension almost seamlessly.  Georgie's death was a lot more intense than what I was expecting it to be. My favorite part was ""Rock War!"".

-NAILED IN THE FACE- I haven't seen anyone mention it, but the most disturbing part of Pennywise to me was the fact that 90% of the time his eyes we're offset. It was like the monster/fear itself didn't really know how to fully replicate a human being. That small little detail just disturbed the fuck out of me.  [deleted] I'm so glad that they held back so much from the trailers. I remember someone on reddit a few weeks ago complaining that ""they show all the scary parts in the trailers"" but boy they were wrong. The scenes in the trailer were on average only like 20% of the actual scenes in the movie. They kept so much under wraps, it was very very impressive, and I'm so grateful. I hope that other studios can understand that audiences enjoy being surprised.  Not scary at all? Scary? Or Very Scary?  Pennywise's TEETH.... As soon as I saw his teeth grab Georgie's arm I knew I was going to enjoy the movie I love how they changed up a lot of Pennywises forms to keep even people super familiar with the book surprised. There was just so much awesome visual horror, from Pennywise stretching out its arm and pulling Georgie in, to Ben's headless dead kid, to Stan's flute lady, to Eddie's leper, the fridge scene, the projector scene, and so much more that I couldn't list it all. It reminded me a lot of the final scene of Cabin in the Woods, where there was so much cool horror imagery that I couldn't keep track of it all. I think It will be an excellent movie to rewatch multiple times. I also liked how they put a bit more emphasis on the fact Pennywise is an otherworldly creature, what with the dead kids floating around its ""nest"" and how they portrayed the deadlights. Speaking of its nest, I love that hellish dance It does in front of Bev. I never knew stabilizing a scene around one point could be so damn unsettling. Some of the camera work was really cool too, with the disorienting and terrifying shutter effect.

It was also the best kind of scary, at least for my tastes. It was creepy, not terrifying, but after coming home from the movie, I quickly realized that childhood fear of the dark had been reinstilled in me. There was a really primal horror throughout the whole movie that seeped into my brain and came to life at the most inopportune times. I love it when a horror film sticks like that. I kept expecting to see a one armed decaying boy scream at me from a random corner of my house.

Seriously, I had an absolute blast with this film. It totally lived uo to my expectations while managing to surprise them at the same time. One thing that most people will miss: Those orange lights during the dance scene? That is IT! That's closer to his real form than the actual Drider. In the book, as an adult, Ben gets to look at Pennywise's true form and he describes IT as ""endless writhing orange lights"". ""You're lucky we aren't measuring dicks"" - Richie Tozier Best part was when Pennywise hit the Ric Flair walk when he got out the fridge Can we talk about those weird yet awesome scenes like where it zooms in on the New Kids on the Block poster and the Rock fight scene. I loved  how absurd and stylistic it was.  Loved that scene near the end when Bill confronted ""Georgie"". Georgie refers to the boat as ""it"" and Bill corrects him and says, ""Not It, She""

Such subtle word-play for those who know what I'm talking about. #EGGBOY

I really don't care for scary movies, but that was a blast. Surprisingly wholesome, but I feel for Ben. Unrelated to the movie, but the second the movie ended, this dude starts going OFF on this girl. Guess she was on her phone most of the movie and he yells loud enough for the entire theater to hear, ""Why the fuck you gatta be on your phone the whole movie, you stupid bitch?! Who the fuck you texting the whole time, your boyfriend is right here, who else do you gatta text?!"" Me, astonished just watching the whole time watching this dude and girl yell at eachother, while her boyfriend (who I add, definitely looks like he can handle himself in a fight) says completely nothing. 

At this point, they argued while exiting the theater and once they reached the main lobby, she throws her drink at him, he starts charging herand some other random dude fucking tackles him from the side, people start yelling WorldStar, and shit went down. 

Really killed my excitement about the movie/made me laugh at the hilarity of this sitch lmao I just got out of that movie, and holy fucking shit did I enjoy myself. I can't tell you how much fun I had! That was definitely one of my favorite horror movies I've ever seen.

Sophia was AMAZING! She WILL win an Oscar one day. Finn was hysterical, and I haven't jumped on the Stranger Things train, so I'm glad I got to see him in this, first. 


Again. I fucking loved that movie! One of my biggest takeaways from this film, is that this guy should definitely be in the running to direct a Nightmare on elm street remake if the opportunity arises. 

I could see him making some cool dream sequences.  Movie was dope 9/10 Glad it wasn’t in 3D because the projector scene would have made me shit myself. *Was she hot?*

That kid was a fucking riot XD Anyone have thoughts about the relationship of the kids with their parents? Obviously Beverly and her father is significant, as the climax showed that Beverly wasn't afraid of Pennywise because the thing she feared the most was her father. Not sure if this is part of the novel, or the original adaptation, but I thought it was brilliant. The juxtaposition of the kids' innocence and wanting to hold onto 'their summer' and the parents' fears and avoidance was kind of mind blowing to me. Love that it's implied that much of the town seemed nonchalant to the disappearances *because* many of them were kids 27 years before and had chosen to ignore and run from their fears instead of confronting them. 

Really impressed that there is more than meets the eye with this film.  Thinking about that blank stare he gives Georgie right before taking his arm. The drifting stare mixed with that drool alone is nightmare inducing.  I found the part where Pennywise was dancing in his little stage fooking hilarious. No one else thought it was funny. 

Also can someone explain how the fuck a kiss broke Bev's spell? I thought I was watching Disney How has nobody mentioned 

E G G B O I Okay. Wow. That was fucking great. 

Georgie's death. WOW. I knew it was coming, but that was fucking brutal. And it wasn't even the part where he got his arm torn off that fucked me up. It was him crawling away, armless and screaming. That was super fucked up. I loved it. I had my mouth open in surprise throughout the whole sequence. 

Bill as Pennywise. Truly terrifying. Every scene he was in just had you on the edge of your seat. He was creepy, unnerving and the quirkiness he had was amazing. 

The kids were obviously one of the best parts of the movie. Everyone just had that believeable chemistry. You'd think they'd been friends since they were toddlers. Richie was hilarious. His remarks were so well timed and so well delivered. My favorite Loser easily. 

All in all, it was great. Just simply amazing. Sure they omitted a lot of important parts such as the smokehouse and the clubhouse but I'm hoping that shows up in the next chapter. 

10/10 easily for me. Definitely would watch again. Definitely buying it on Blu-ray when it releases.  So, there was a turtle in the water when they were swimming and a Lego turtle in Georgie's room. Any other turtle sightings? This was an awesome film. Not only was it terrifying, but it also had some genuine, heart-felt moments between the members of the Losers Club. Oh, and it also had some serious laughs, which all fit well and landed, which I didn't expect (kudos to Finn Wolfhand for knocking Richie ""Trash Mouth"" Tozier out of the park). The only thing I wanted more of was Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise! He was INCREDIBLE. My favourite scene was when he had Eddie after crawling out of the fridge. That scene felt like it slowed down and watching him mess with Eddie was straight nightmare fuel. Go see this film, you will not be disappointed! For some reason that library scene fucked me up. The lady in the back actually made me start sweating and the balloon being completely still but still moving was easily the most unsettling part in the movie for me. It just hit me that Georgie's fear was disappointing Bill. That's heartbreaking. Loved the movie, but I'll have to see it again since my theater was under the impression they could run their mouths the whole time. One dude even called someone out which eventually led to a fight in the bathroom after the movie. 

I had to move seats because the people behind me wouldn't shut up. If I ever encounter It, chances are he'll be in the form of an annoying audience. 

Also, I know how you feel Ben. I've been there man. Keep your head up.  A woman in the theater let out a big ""hell no"" as soon as Henry called out the cat as his target. The audience gave a big laugh at that, then was immediately brought back in by the appearance of his father. The movie did such a great job of controlling the audience. They changed a whole mess of stuff from the book, while still hitting a lot of the major beats.  But it all worked. 
Really the only change I took issue with was they took the Derry history exposition away from Mike and gave it to Ben.  It was fine, but it made Mike's already limited screen presence feel even more limited.   He did get the big last fight scene with Bowers, though.

All the kids were amazing.  Skarsgard was perfect.  Effects were good.  Pacing couldn't have been better.  Jump scares were well done.  Ridiculously funny.  ""And now I'm going to have to kill this fucking clown"", and the entire fucking theater cheers. 

9/10 I really liked how Pennywise didn't talk much.

Tim Curry's Pennywise felt like an actual clown, whereas this one felt more like an entity. Like he wasn't quite human and all he could do is mimic humans. I got up to use the bathroom when things looked calm, but literally the moment I touched the door handle was when Beverly's Dad said ""Where do you think you're sneaking off to?""

Just about died. Just got back from the theater and holy shit was this movie awesome. It had the perfect mix of jump scares and just straight up horrifying scenes, as well as some great visuals. 

My favorite parts:

Pennywise using Georgie as a fucking hand puppet

The camera when we has dancing in the sewer

When the kid was in the library in the background and you can see the librarian looking all possessed at him

and of course the projector and fridge scene  How they will replace Richie is beyond me. Finn rocked that.  The opening scene disturbed the hell out of me. I'm not familiar with the book, but I knew that Georgie was gonna die, but I had no idea he was going to get his arm bitten off and that the audience would have to see such a sweet kid in so much pain and anguish. Excellent film though. Watched it with my son who pointed out that no matter how crazy it got, one kid always put his bike's kickstand down, instead of just throwing it down like the other kids. I'll have to watch again to see who he was. The moment with all of the kids staring at Bev as she was lying in her bathing suit was awesome. Simple, yet perfectly captured moment. That gazebo line was priceless The actress playing Beverly reminded me of a teenage Amy Adams Anyone else notice that we see a copy of The Frog Prince in Ben's room, then he later brings Beverly to life with a kiss?  ""Can only virgins see this shit or something?"" - Richie to the girl he called a whore before All I want to know, does Bill have the stutter? The 80's montage while cleaning the bathroom killed me.  This was one of the most intense and most fun horror movies I've ever seen. It was actually scary and pretty damn funny at the same time, which made it an awesome movie theater experience. If you're remotely interested in this movie I'd definitely recommend seeing this in theaters with some friends. 

Also, super glad it turned out the way it did. Everyone for the past year and a half has been saying ""Pennywise isn't supposed to look scary. You can't replace Tim Curry. This is gonna be another generic horror movie."" This movie completely crushes the original in every way and Pennywise is actually scary, entertaining, and menacing. Happy to see this movie was better than everyone thought it'd be when they first released pictures of Pennywise. I really hope Bill Skarsgard starts getting more big roles after this. Taking a role that Tim Curry played to perfection and making it your own? Excellent stuff! Yeah, that was cruel as fuck. Man, that moment when when Eddy (asthma guy) crawled backwards during the fridge scene and and leans against the wall he tries to hit Pennywise, but it turns out to be just a light slap because of fear. It grabs his arm and plays with Eddy as if it is trying to bite him, but it just wants to see his reaction and laugh... that scene got stuck in my head firmly That was the moment that turned me from ""flight"" to ""fight."" My whole attitude shifted like ""You wot, mate!?"" Such delivery from Skarsgard with that line!  That dead stare was maybe the most creepy thing he did the entire movie  Holy shit, I love this observation! I was completely creeped out, but did not think this far into it.
When Pennywise started drooling a little bit...fucking hell.  I also loved the moment right before where he's describing the smells  ""and....popcorn!"" And of course that's what everyone in the theater is also smelling. Really cool theatrical moment. I got the sense that he hated that laugh. He did his job too well and had to get some fear put back into the poor boy as we see Georgie's mood change too. [Pop! Pop! Pop!](https://twitter.com/bailsongjoe/status/905628008928514048)  I think Pennywise's last word in the movie, ""Fear"", was meant to be similar to how people say ""Water"" when they're thirsty. > dark fantasy adventure movie 

Agreed and I feel like that's closer to the tone/style of the book, too. > dark fantasy adventure movie instead of a gritty horror flick

It kind of felt like ultra-violent Beetlejuice at times, which I loved. I expect the part two to be more gruesome. I think because Pennywise plays on fears, the kids only have kids fears (for the most part), but as adults they fear Pennywise and what he does.  I think they were aiming for, and largely hit, that uncanny valley. That's the fucking six flags guy dance, so it was absurd, but not enough to truly reach that ""funny"" level, so it was sufficiently creepy. I thought the more effective camera trick was taking that portrait's POV when Stan straightened it.  I laughed so hard at that face tracking I love how they shot that scene as well as when Pennywise was running occasionally.  His whole character was more unsettling than scary, and it was fantastic.  Bowers was a great bully, I agree, and the whole usage of the tv as a way for Pennywise to exert his influence was amazing. Pretty sure he was also in the tv in the first scene we see Bev's apartment.  The entire section about Patrick is the creepiest fucking thing in the whole book and my favorite part, I was really bummed it was left out. I was mad he was killed off so early.



The entire ending with Pennywise just feeling so defeated, not just beaten up, but realizing he can't scare them anymore, was so well done. The sun tanning thing cracked me up. 

Sorry girl, as a fellow ginger it's not going to work.   [deleted] The best part was after with Eddie screaming, ""DON'T YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME!!"" When Ritchie said he had to snap it back into place.  It's terrifying because he's literally playing with his food I knew people said It was gruesome, but WOW I didn't expect that either > Implying ""gazebos"" wasn't Eddie's best line No way ""and now I have to kill this *fucking clown*"" take the cake. My entire theatre cheered haha 

Then again they cheered at the second fanny pack line too lol  'RUN EGGBOY' also deserves a honourable mention  ""Why do you have two fanny packs?"" False. 

""Don't you fucking touch me!"" Was amazing Really fantastic how they played us, made us think we saw it all already from the trailer. A+ That was a jump scare done beautifully, imo. My whole theatre jumped at that. The whole theater lost their shit when that happened. Like 50% of the theater screamed and jumped. First time I've heard so many screams during a horror movie.  My brain's first instinct was to get the hell out of there before he did it for real. i dont know if it was meant to be obvious but everytime the TV was on in the background and the kids were alone you could hear them talking about clowns/floating or some shit. I noticed this because there were subtitles. Kill them all! Kill them all! One thing that I'm not sure if too many people noticed was how much It manipulated what you see and hear.  The TV show telling you to play in the sewers was one thing, but after the scene where they clean the bloody bathroom, Ben walks from Bev's room to see Bev and Bill talking near each other and visibly flirting.  After Ben walks away, we see that Bev was actually standing at the sink and wasn't talking to Bill at all.  It just wanted Ben to think that they were flirting. ""I love Derry"" on the balloon as well. Also Richie was wearing a Freese's general store shirt, which I think is where he hides from Henry and co after being chased in the book. It's been a while since I read the book, so I'm no 100 percent sure. Yeah, he felt like a kind of undeveloped character. 

When they were all deciding whether or not to go into the house, I half expected him to say 'You kidding me? I'm a black underdeveloped character in a horror film. Like fuck am I going in there!' I think the slingshot was cooler than a sheep killing gun...i miss Eddie's battery acid scene too.  They totally nailed Pennywise , he wasn't a clown , he was something alien trying to be a clown  That was my favorite part of the whole movie, it was so disturbing but I couldn't stop laughing The warp stabilization in those shots of Pennywise were such an interesting choice. Not just lurking, that creepy ass smile she had. I'll probably never go to a library again. Every single adult in the film is creepy. I noticed that too! freaked me out but nothing came of it It almost looked like a time-freeze thing, the whole background was still until the balloon appeared. I was thinking they'd call back to the Prince Albert library scene from the miniseries, where nobody can see/hear whats going on. When Eddie was getting his cast signed I thought the bully was gonna turn into Pennywise for some reason, similar face shapes and bubblegum bubble =/= balloon 

There were some really solid fake outs that helped build that tension  Yep. Another poster said it best, but what King does well, and what the movie did well, is in making human villains as scary and creepy as monsters. The movie did a great job showing how apathetic, creepy or downright dangerous Derry and it's citizens are. > it's really hard to google any thing about it

I see what you did there This part was censored in my country and I only found out about it from your comment ""I can't believe I drew the short stick... too bad this wasn't a dick measuring contest."" ""Do you need to be a virgin to see this fuckin' clown?"" It and Get Out are two horror movies from this year that absolutely understand how important comic relief is. I absolutely died in the theater after that line. His delivery was fucking perfect.  I was also a fan of ""Go blow your dad, you mullet wearing asshole"" when he was trash talking Henry Can you imagine what it's like to be her?  Walking around down here with just one shoe?

In-fucking-appropriate Richie.  (we love you) I loved how he constantly went for the high five and they all just ignored him.  I liked the movie and this was still the best part Between this and Stranger Things, Finn Wolfhard is going places. ""Boats are always called She."" Was like old yeller, man...  The clown was the gazebo all along. There actually were families in my theater. I have no idea how they figured to bring young kids to this film. The humor in this movie was so great. Constant belly laugh followed by edge of your see creepyness. Yep. Taylor was absolutely *adorable* in the scenes where Ben interacts with Bev.  I love how cool and understanding Bev was.  That was the funniest bit in the whole movie for me. So absurd to stick that in there while they were discussing Derry's dark past. Probably the hardest I laughed the entire movie. That yell was so perfect. ROCK FIGHT!!!! As if that wasn't bad enough, him then trying to crawl away without an arm... Even crazier was Pennywise's arm stretching out of the sewer to grab him...watching him get dragged down was fucking mortifying.  Are you sure you guys got all the right stuff for him? /wink Eddie was the funniest Loser after Richie. Jack Dylan Grazer brought a franticness and anxiousness to Eddie that the TV adaptation never came close to accomplishing. I was thinking the same thing. Nothing in the movie said It didn't have the power to sustain human life or possess a human's body who was still alive. The fact that Bev was about to sent up to ""float"" while alive implied other kids It had were still alive. Also, we've seen in other horror movies like Alien how a monster will keep a host alive in their nest to feed off of them. that ending of the mist was so freaking sad man Oh yeah, poor Bev. The kids think she's a slut and the adults hope she's a slut. And her father, holy shit. I found her father to be scariest for me in a movie about a killer clown. And he's a poet. I like the scene when the Losers are breaking up it takes Ritchie saying ""Look at this motherfucker"" for anyone to notice he's been slashed lol Ben was a motherfucking pimp in the book. From moving in and showing these kids how to build a proper dam, to writing that sick ass poem to Bev, then losing all his weigh and chugging a bottle of Wild Turkey and not dying. Bens my true hero of the book. And movie now.  The actor has inverted nipples and they were all I could stare at during the quarry scene. It didn't hurt the scene but it was all i could focus on. THEY'RE BULLSHIT What got me was how it disappeared and Pennywise just kinda peaked out and smiled then slinked away afterwards...  Painting Lady was fucked up. I loved the design, super creepy, I loved how it always still looked like a painting.  dnt forget the lego turtle! Best Dark Tower movie this year And Georgie's lego set. This is my take on that. When Pennywise is morphed into Eddie in the mattress and he says something along the lines of spitting a loogie it shows that he must've been watching the kids swimming. The turtle is significant in this moment because it was protecting the kids while they were making their initial bond. Forming into a ka-tet  Lol.  I have a 6yr old and her first scary movie was Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone. I even thought that was heavy If I was a kid and saw this movie I'd be traumatized  [deleted] That's the moment Richie's balls dropped. He went after that Devil clown like a fucking G.  One of the better lines in that character's deep repertoire.  Welcome to the Loser Club asshole!  Richie was such a god damn fucking badass. Holy shit [deleted] I was particularly fond of the part when Ben said ""Derry started as a beaver trapping town.""
Richie's response?
""STILL IS BOYS, AM I RIGHT?!"" When I saw that, I knew right away it'll become a standard reaction gif here.  I laughed aloud at this scene and I am normally low-expression during movies. Felt so casual like ""hey, yeah food's good here, 5 stars am I right, Mikey?"" Almost Beetlejuice-y. It was great because it was so unexpected. In broad daylight, and had nothing to do really with the scene with Mike getting bullied. FUCK, guess I'm going again tomorrow
 Or the part in the basement where it was using him as a fucking hand puppet  Can anyone name anything else **that** violent happening to a child in a mainstream movie? The closest I can think of is the harpoon scene with Laura in *Logan* That honestly really punched me in the gut. I thought the little guy playing Georgie was a particularly cute and endearing kid, and to see him screaming and trying to drag himself away was pretty heartwrenching to me.  I agree, still waiting for the old lady to dive in and pull him away. The boat chasing scene was viewed so often through the advert it feels like they really wanted to follow it up with a bang. I'm really glad they didn't just show Georgie scream and then pan away, as soon as I saw that I knew this was going to be a pretty good adaptation Yes. Everything that was terrifying kinda didn't faze me as much bc I kept worrying about the 6/7 year old girl sitting next to me. 

Her mother is a fuckhead for taking her to that.  Honestly I loved how this came back into play during the loser clubs last stand with IT. and how once IT realized they were no longer afraid and felt fear itself, the skin on his head began to flake away like ashes on crumbling paper. Probably not intended but I heard that line echoing in my mind as pennywise crumbled away This did it for me too. I don't know why more horror movie directors don't play up the ""glowing eyes in the dark"" angle for scares. That shit gets me every time. It's probably an instinct thing, like our ancestors knew glowing eyes in the dark meant predator. Also the mystery of it - something is lurking but you can't tell what. It definitely set the mood for the whole movie. Awesome movie by the way. I love that none of the big scares were ruined by the trailers. What's interesting is he was basically saying the same in the books, but that's only because he keeps passing off what he saw as a dream. I was really happy when they show the Paul Bunyan statue in the movie but I was disappointed they didn't do anything with it lol It was definitely an homage to the film 'Mama'. It was the director's previous film. Abstract art was a mistake.  that was the most terrifying incarnation forme It legitimately took me too long to realize the flute playing... Thought it was just the background music and then I put 2 and 2 together. I was like ooooooooohhhh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit Yeah, the writing and acting really sold how fucked up Bill was over Georgie. He's in denial the whole movie that Georgie is dead, and when he finally accepts it and breaks down in It's lair...an incredibly powerful scene.  That scene where Bill tells Richie to chill and walk through the NOT SCARY AT ALL DOOR cause that halved girl wasn't real, and they walk through it, see Pennywise, about to eat Eddie, who turns his head and says ""IS THIS NOT FUCKING REAL ENOUGH FOR YOU BILL.""

BANANAS. The empty dining room table gave me feels.  Bev has a real good moment too flipping off Richie when he says ""who invited Molly Ringwald?"" I wish they had explored stuff like The Black Spot a little more. Maybe inserted a note about the army cook who knew where to send people to get out of there... but I just love Easter eggs I guess.  Did you notice that at one point, his arms turned into the big big claw things? No kid was afraid of that, it was just a glimpse of his true form. Not sure if anyone noticed it, but during that fight It turns into a mummy to attack Ben. In the book, It first reveals itself to Ben in the form of a mummy. The projector scene was FUCKING NUTS.  One of the most terrifying parts for me was when Pennywise has Eddie in his clutches and he turns around to Bill and says ""Is this not real enough for you? It was real enough for your brother."" The psychological aspect of that was as scary as the projector or the fridge. Couldn't agree more with the projector scene. I felt like the first trailer had taken away all of the tension from that part, but I was wrong. Good Lord, I was wrong. Pennywise untangling himself was hilarious to me somehow but holy Jesus the projector scene is literally giving me nightmares. *just when you think you won*

""SIKE BITCH, YOU THOUGHT"" -pennywise 2017 Yep, that was the biggest jump in the movie for me.  I think he said ""Try tickling your pickle for the first time."" Bill was amazing. I wish he had more dialogue. Every time he was on screen I was captivated. They did a real good job of not showing him for too long in scenes until the end. His voice, and laugh were amazing.  This happened when I saw Rush Hour 3. You know that point when people argue and someone says, ""You wanna take this outside?"" Then someone else intervenes and nothing happens. Yeah, nobody intervened, so the other guy said, ""Yeah, let's take this outside."" They trooped out and beat the shit out of each other in the hallway. 10/10 best Rush Hour film.  Gets a little Lego nod in this one tho! *Bev jumps off cliff*

WHAT THE FUCK Ya, he really did. He just melded perfectly into the role. I was kind of surprised they cast him as Richie when he did such a good Bill-esque role in stranger things, but I completely understand now. I thought i was going nuts cuz they panned back to her like 3 times or so and she was just standing there with her mouth open and im like ""anyone seeing this shit?"" and when he finally gets up she's just casually browsing between isles.  So glad someone mentioned this. I asked my friends after and none of them noticed that. The balloon then floated from her direction and I never want to visit a library again.  Yes. This. Holy shit. I almost blurted it out in the theatre.

""IS ANYONE ELSE SEEING THAT?""

That shit was the scariest. Because there's NO fucking context to it. It just very subtly happened. Honestly the whole Ben sequence fucked me up the most. The headless kid chasing him through the stacks followed by the remark ""Hey egg boy"" by Pennywise himself just scared me senseless.

*edit I'm an egghead, Ben's an Egg boy I missed all of these subtleties. Fuck. I feel like the whole movie showed some serious arrogance on the part of Pennywise which is the case with most monsters that prefer to hunt in movies. They toy with the subjects a little bit too long and then they're overcome. Apparently there's gonna be a lot of flashbacks in part 2 which is good. Her having her mouth right open as the blood exploded upwards... ughhhhh.... God, when he was making the popcorn noise and laughing with Georgie. Then suddenly went blank and started...gurgling for a moment. Like an animal knowing it was about eat its prey.     > Bev stole the show and my heart

Who let the pharmacist on Reddit? Damn . . I just got that . . .I thought float like water.  I'm dumb Well, floating always has a double meaning in the book, the dead kid's spirits ""floating"" down in the dark with pennywise, but also their physical bodies wrapped up, hanging from the ceiling by pennywise's spider form, which they are probably going to cover in part 2  She just needed the good ol KISS ME, FAT BOY! I wonder how Pennywise will go after the Losers Club in Part II. It seems that Henry fell to his death in the well, but IIRC, in the novel and miniseries, he got exposed to the deadlights and went insane, which is why IT was able to control him the second time 27 years later.  I went from happy to dreadful in literally a heartbeat. That was such a good bait and switch.  I agree. That is classic King and it is specifically mentioned in the book that the adults in Derry are infected with evil due to the presence of IT.   Richie asking Eddie's mom if he wanted a kiss and telling the person who was patching up Ben to SUCK IT OUT SUCK IT OUT! Richie was hilarious. Almost every joke landed with me - my favourite was probably when he said something like ""Who invited Molly Ringwald?"" Richie was perfect. At one point I even thought to myself ""Goddamn Richie, shut up"" then I realized, that's exactly how Richie should be.  That actor kid should probably not be allowed to see this movie before age 21 because of how much abuse he suffers. I can't be the only one that thought Eddie was hilarious? Him and Richie were perfect. I really wanted to know what was in those other doors During the rock battle, there is a patch of grass behind Henry Bowers and there is a dark shadow under the leaves where you can spot glowing eyes.  Yeah, that was to let us know it wasn't really Georgie I'm assuming. There is always one person on their phone during a movie and even if they are 6 rows ahead(yes I counted them tonight) the light is enough to take away from the experience.  This dude did what we've all wanted to do at least once. The guy sitting next to me in my theater checked his phone every 10-15 minutes. Would just do a quick scroll through Facebook. Like, why the fuck? NO RICHIE SHE WASNT HOT. Beverly's fear was her budding sexuality and peoples perception of it. Her father is creepy, her period approaches, kids think she's a slut, adults want her to be one, these all have her living in fear as a young woman. In the book, Beverly overcomes this by literally having group sex with the other guys in the sewers. This was a nice way to still have that element without the, you know, creepy child sewer orgy.  Holy fuck the lady at back just grinning had me scared af.And everytime they were changing angles she was coming closer. The Jewish kid. Yes. He also repeats his poem a bunch of times. ""Why is it sooo mean!?"" The more fear Eddie has the more delicious he is to Pennywise.  Makes you wonder what other fucked up shit he did to his victims to make them more delicious. It's like those dreams where your punches have no effect In nearly every scene with Pennywise, one eye is staring at the camera. That's why he's bow-eyed. I read that instead of using CGI for that wandering eye effect, it is something that Bill Skarsgaard can actually do. Which is pretty damn cool.  He was hungry.. The drooling was actually an effect the costume had on Skarsgard, so they made it part of the character. Yeah, that made me do a kind of mental double-take You're absolutely correct! This director definitely was influenced by Burton. I thought this was super evident in the scene when Richie finds the weird mini doppelgänger of himself in the coffin with the mouth sewn shut. I even thought Danny Elfman did the soundtrack till I just checked. Definite Elfman homage. Also, one of the kids has a Beetlejuice movie poster on their wall and the theater was playing Burton's 1989 Batman. You almost have to pull the punches with child actors. I don't think a scene with Bev fucking the Losers Club or getting raped by her father would have worked. Yeah, those things are dark and unsettling as can be, but it would probably sour the majority of viewers. Hinting at it and leaving it to the imagination is more effective.

However, with adults, more gruesome things could occur.  I just thought it was kind of funny, personally. But I'm not at all scared of/creeped out by clowns, so... That little jig he did gave me the heebie-jeebies almost more any anything else. There's something about that look on his face and that hyperfast body movement that terrifies me.  Also at Eddie's Yeah there was mention of sewers iirc I feel it was heavily implied enough from the weird handling of her and ""my girl"" that he definitely raped her Exactly! Imagine how scared you would be. 

You see those sharp teeth about to bear down on your hand then nope...just kidding! Then he does it again!  
 It's even more gruesome in the book. I kind of knew that they wouldn't do it exactly how it was written because I feel like whenever they're dealing with the death of a child, directors have to walk a fine line. If it's too disturbing, people won't want to watch it. 

The kid who played George was fantastic though. I wanted to reach through the screen to give him a huge hug and fix his little arm.  I was kinda annoyed they took that scene away from Mr. Keene.  I'm a pharmacist as well, and I always liked how he seemed to genuinely care about Eddie.  They kinda turned him into a creepy Clark Kent in this.   I think Eddie was my favourite loser I fucking loved that monologue. So perfectly delivered. It's impossible not to love Finn. That scene, as well as Bills encounter in the cellar. Pennywise popping up and using zombie George as a puppet was brutal THIS! I expected nothing else after the picture changed to It. Then he pops out of the fucking screen as a giant, and I nearly pissed myself. This movie was worth every penny. I want more! Yesssss I'm so glad I wasn't the only who noticed this! 

I think it was when we saw Eddie walking into his house, you hear the TV saying ""Come play in the sewers! Bring your friends! Meet the clown!"" Or something to that extent.  It could be a way for Pennywise to subconsciously lure people into the sewers.  I missed the battery acid scene as well, but at least they had an homage to it with the acid leaking from the mattress. It was totally true. Pennywise couldn't even speak English correctly, he put emphasis on the wrong words, and he couldnt even contain his growls. He was a hungry predator. A great portrayal. POP POP POP POP POP I'm glad they worked the deadlights in. I was laughing, yet still unsettled. It was fantastic. Every time they did it I felt like I was hypnotically drawn towards the clown, like I could understand if the kid was debating which way to go. It was a cool effect. 'You look like Lois Lane' 


 When they were in the river and someone mentioned there was something in the water, then Ben dove in and the camera followed him. I gripped my seat, I was so ready for another pennywise Its crazy to look back and realize that these genuinely good-hearted youngins have to live in a town full of such scummy adults like this. THAT part was censored? What about like, the rest of the fucking movie. Was it like 10 minutes long!? Lmao  God, Finn was great.  What a great fucking reference there, and an extremely good line on its own at that. ""you guys are lucky we weren't measuring wangs"" Comic relief is necessary for these types of horror films. Obviously tone is important, but if you're dealing with average people, they have senses of humor, and humor goes a long way when it comes to endearing your audience to the characters.  I never thought I'd laugh as hard as I did during this movie. Richie is a stone cold savage. But Eddie's mom already knew that.  We shall watch his career with great interest.  Was that line from Bill to Georgie at the end, ""'She,' Georgie, boats are called 'She,'"" or something, supposed to be when Bill realizes Georgie really is dead, and it's actually Pennywise? I couldn't tell if that was his realization moment or not. ""Look at the rabbits Georgie!"" Just realizing this now, was this him realizing that it wasn't his brother and it was in fact pennywise because pennywise messed up and called the boat an it.  Gazebos mean bullshit. [deleted] Yeah they managed to have a whole conversation with facial expressions and hand gestures, it was great acting

Bev: Really?
Ben: Please keep the door open, I need this friendship 
Bev: You're adorable. Okay, let's never speak of this again  ""Go blow your dad, you mullet wearing asshole""

Or something like that lol This movie fucking ruled Not just any rock fight, an *apocalyptic* rock fight!   I have to say, kids back in the 80's went harder than me and my friends. I'd get beaned with a pebble and be like ""I'm out!"" We were all to pain adverse for that noise... And him screaming for Bill. Jesus, that was Fucked. Up.  ""Billy!"" But then you realize he could have done that the entire time. It waited for Georgie to reach. For the sport of it. I saw it coming, braced myself not to scream like a little girl but I still shit my pants.  I absolutely agree.  That kid has a future.  I was so happy with his casting - and really, with all of the kids. This is one of the most believable group of kids we've had in a while, up there with Stranger Things and Super 8.  The way we whispered ""are you still daddy's little girl"" set the tone that shits been happening without showing us the shit that's been happening. The difference between a big E Evil like Pennywise and a small e evil like the father.

Evil creatures are scary but we know they are not real outside of the movie.

evil people are terrifying because we all have heard stories or know someone like them. They exist in real life.


See also Voldemort vs Dolores Umbridge.  So he's the bard, got it. > chugging a bottle of Wild Turkey and not dying

By snorting the juice of a couple of limes.

And he basically kicked Bowers' ass when he got over his fear. Ben was fucking awesome. As someone who grew up with inverted nipples, it felt great to be represented in a movie Reminded me of this
https://media.giphy.com/media/11Vfbn18i3XsNq/giphy.gif It dissapeared because that painting lady was only the fear for 1 of the kids, it's ineffective when all the kids are there. That's why he changes to the clown before he leaves, he wanted all the kids to be scared and the clown is the go to body I thought Fievel Goes West was too much for my 3 year old. Ha. My 8 year old's first ""scary"" movie was Coraline months ago and she's still creeped out when she sees the photo on Netflix.  He was awesome. Some of the best comedic relief I've ever seen for a tense movie like that.  I AM MOTHERFUCKING SICK AND TIRED OF THESE TRANDIMENSIONAL SPIDERS ON MY MOTHERFUCKING PLANE! Richie's balls dropped when he came out of the fucking womb lol ""Go suck your dads dick you mullet wearing asshole!"" Was among my favorites  That's a good one, but as soon as I saw Pennywise's rage-dance I instantly thought that would obtain smash-hit gif status Ugh. That part seriously fucked me up.  Not as visible, but the The Witch had a gruesome scene with an infant.  I can't think of anything. It truly shocked me.

The end with ""Georgie"" was pretty violent too.  Well, maybe it was just because I have strong feelings on the subject, but Bevvy's dad was the fucking creepiest; that was jarring. They said so much by saying so little and not making it gratuitous. It reminded me of Elle Fanning in Super 8, a little bit. The Alex Kitner scene from Jaws was pretty shocking for the time.  Hearing him scream for his brother before he disappears really fucked me up as an older brother. [deleted] More importantly, it shows that it's different from the 1990 one with that scene. I expected it to pan away because of what happened in the 1990 version, and it skullfucked my expectations to a bitter death. Andy muschietti had a painting like that in his home growing up he was terrified of. That's why it keeps popping up It's 100% a reference to the Painter Amadeo Modigliani, who painted his subjects in a simplified and elongated style

[Example a](https://news.brown.edu/files/article_images/Modigliani1_0.jpg)

[Example b](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuDcJT7UMAEZohU.jpg)

It makes sense that a painting in that style would be in the Synagogue as Modigliani is one of the most famous Jewish artists of all time.

I remember going to an exhibit of his works when I was a kid and the lifeless eyes and colored scleras gave me nightmares too. Can't blame the poor kid for hating that painting. [deleted] #   I feel like the refrigerator scene is going to go down in movie history as one of the most unsettling scenes in mainstream horror movie history.

That whole section was visual horror nirvana.
The fridge, the ""oh, is this not real enough for you bill?"" The stake through the head and continued violence.
For me, the scene in that section that took the cake is a tie between the fridge and when pennywise is retreating down the well and bill sees his face and hands slip down the rim. 

 I read that there were two scenes cut from the film, at least one of them exploring The Black Spot, and that they're likely to be used for the sequel as flashback scenes. But we got the easter eggs I was really hoping to see the werewolf then. I also missed the whole power of imagination defeating IT. Like with Eddie's inhaler or Bill with his phrase helping him. It seems like that bolt gun for sheep still worked without the canister but I think people who didn't read the book might not understand how much their childish intuition saved them. I knew he would pop out of the screen, but the size and scale of it, holy shit snacks. I am never going in my garage alone again. I had to wipe sweat from my brow after that one!  At that moment I really thought Bill was going to go ape shit on IT. Same! The payoff for that build-up was amazing - it got the biggest reaction from our theatre overall (for both scares or laughs). And a mention in the lake!!  We were losing it during that lol. The other biggest laugh was ""they're gazebos mom!"" I love how the shot was in slow motion, but his voice wasn't. ....and now I'm going to have to kill this FUCKING CLOWN I'm not sure why people are so surprised he could be funny. He had the single best line reading in Stranger Things when Eleven flips the van over and Dustin's like ""holy shit, did you guys see that?!?!?"" and he says in the most withering voice imaginable, ""No, Dustin, we *missed* it."" Yeah I was reading that that was intentional on the directors part. He wanted you to feel like you were seeing something nobody else was, like Pennywise was reaching out to you. Really cool effect. Stephen King wants you to BUY his books, dammit I wish more of the scares were like this instead of in your face screaming jump scares Yes, in every one-on-one encounter with each of the Losers he really could have killed them all then, but he lets them get away. 

Mike: Disappears after Mike gets assaulted by Bowers gang

Ben: Disappears after Ben runs out of the library

Stan: Runs away from flute lady

Bev: Goes back down the drain

Bill: Slinks away after Bill runs back up the stairs

Eddie: Runs away from Pennywise behind Neiboldt St

Maybe they had the power of the Turtle?

Contrast this with Georgie and Patrick Hostettler who were killed immediately. 

 Yeah but pennywise feeds off fear so he has a reason for toying Georgie stopped being afraid of him for a second, so Pennywise bluescreened. D: That was my thought too. I don't remember the book really covering it either. I just assumed water because they spent so much time in the sewers or in this case, well. I like the addition of the kids literally floating. Adds to the deadlights too. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Prince

Was a book in her room Bigger role for Tom, maybe? It's the classic didn't die on screen, can't be dead thing with Henry, for me. I think he fell to a lower level of the sewers, just like IT retreated to. There's already been talk that we're going to get some kid flashbacks in Chapter 2 - I will not be surprised if we see Bowers see some deadlights.  He'll come back as Henry the white after he starts the balrog  There was not a single sympathetic adult in the film. Even Rabbi Uris was an asshole. I think the ""as long as my wang"" and then ""thats pretty short"" got the most laughs Beep-beep Richie
 I loved Eddie so much in this movie. All the kids were so perfectly cast.  Aw man, I hope they filmed alternate scenes where Ben and Richie look through the other doors on DVD or something. addiction  ""You would think that a psychotic killing clown would be a little nicer!"" Plus children are easier to scare. Think about the adults he killed and the fucked up shit he did to freak them out. I enjoyed that aspect because it excused every time he took his time taunting the kids. In a lot of movies the villain will catch up to one of the main characters,  and instead of instantly killing him they monologue until some other character swoops in to save him. It always feels so artificial, but in IT it made sense and only amplified the scene.  I believe the term ""Salting the meat"" is used in the book So real life? Apparently Bill Skarsgard can actually do that with his eyes.  I loved all the oddities with his face. It did a good job illustrating how Pennywise isn't It's true form, just a ""mask"" he puts on to lure children. http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/293/317/1e5.gif My boyfriend and I overheard the part about the sewers coming from the TV and we looked at each other like what the hell kind of show are they watching.

It wasn't until the ""kill them all"" bit where we thought maybe pennywise was using the TV to manipulate kids so he could get them. They did a really good job establishing the fact that they genuinely cared for each other as brothers as well as not using a stereotypical brotherly relationship(all within minutes/such a short time frame). 





 It was almost kind of touching and made it all the more harder to watch his fate at the hands of Pennywise.  Showing his fear of the basement was also a nice little touch and helped make him feel human. Only difference in the book is that Pennywise leaves him to bleed out in the street.  I wouldn’t agree that is is more gruesome in the book. Lots of things are way more gruesome in the book, but the handling of Georgie’s arm extraction is more savage in the movie.  I think you should read the book again. Mr. Keene definitely doesn't care about Eddie, and its implied he gets some kind of sick pleasure out of telling Eddie about the placebos. When he gagged after Richie told him to stop breathing through his mouth cause he'd be eating the smell I burst out laughing in the theatre. I will need to go watch again, think I was too busy flinching to see he was being puppeted lol I only noticed it in Beverly's house. I'll have to see this again. Which is an added bonus to having a foreign actor play It. Bill didn't mind letting his Swedish intonations and emphases slip in to make Pennywise seem just alien enough. The ""Take the boat"" scene jumps to mind.  The way he'd pronounce everything wrong reminded me of the Gman from Half Life. Good shit. Scenes of the girl swimming with the losers were cut. The Lois Lane line that people are discussing here wasn't in the movie. Bev suddenly appeared in the pharmacy hiding something behind her back so I assume there was also another scene cut. 

Basically any scene that is mildly sexual or too gory wasn't in the movie Reference to what? I'm pretty sure that was just him being a wise ass like he was the entire movie. Yeah, that was it. Kinda seemed like he was getting there before that, but that was the final tipping point. 

But man, the acting from that little kid was spot on.  They really did not hold back with this scene That got me the most!!!! Despite what's happening his last thoughts are about his brother :( Bill Skarsgard had a great story about him on Jimmy Kimmel. They were shooting a scene where Pennywise was in his face yelling and screaming, etc. and he thought he was probably traumatizing and scaring Jack. When the director yelled cut, Bill says ""are you okay, Jack?"" Jack responds ""yeah man, I really love what you're doing with the character here.""

Made me laugh, haha. Yup. It was explicit without being graphic or exploitative.  Her dad was so creepy, those scenes were super uncomfortable A constant theme seemed to be that the parents are monsters as well and not any real solace  Because Other Mother is legit creepy.  **ROCK FIIIIIIIIIIGHT** Riches balls dropped when he banged Eddie moms Every bone in my body was telling me that should've been unintentionally comedic but somehow it was actually creepy. I don't know if I missed it in the trailer or just didn't see it. But when I realized his hand was up his back I straight up froze  Ah good ole baby lotion I loved that part with ""Georgie"" because it went on a HAIR too long, like just enough for a LITTLE bit of doubt to come into play After the scene all I could think was ""WOW"".  He was awful but that pharmacist was fucking awful too. When Bev was distracting him by saying he looked like Clark Kent with the glasses and then he told her she looked like Lois Lane with the glasses I shuddered at the sheer creepiness of it. That whole subplot was handled so well. I'm an older brother as well, and that scene fucked me up for the same reason. My little brother is 18, but I still had a nightmare last night about it. 

That scene in both this movie and the 1990's version are what make the IT movies the only movies that have ever actually scared me in my lifetime.

 Well good on his parents for scarring him for life. It makes for good movies. Yup. Not to mention how distant his parents are now.  Exactly. He just sort of breaks down with his friends comforting him. I think confronting and killing the Georgie-it helped him, in a fucked up way.  >I feel like the refrigerator scene is going to go down in movie history as one of the most unsettling scenes in mainstream horror movie history.

I agree, that was a fantastic scene. However, IMO there's a refrigerator scene in the book (that was not in the movie) which was even more unsettling. Pennywise sucking the face off Stan was quite horrifying as well :S oh man that whole library basement sequence made the hair on my arms and the back of my neck stand on end.  

Also during this sequence; I was super happy that they included the head in the tree that was discussed in the book. People in my theater legitimately screamed. It was like being on an amusement park ride He was fattening them up with fear. After all these are its only meals it has to sustain itself for 27 years. Yeah, it's like Pennywise went **""I'm supposed to feed on your fear, you little shit, not entertain you.""** I always figured ""we all float down here"" meant that they floated in the water as it carried their lifeless bodies through the sewers.  A cold open featuring henry waking up in the sewers would be a fantastic way to start the second film. ""Derry was started as a beaver trapping camp.""

""Still is, am I right, boys?""

EDIT: Swapped trading for trapping. Which adults?  It actually made me feel a bit better about having a lazy eye. Like they made it useful for the film

Although, I guess like Bill I can control mine. I can ""feel"" when my eye starts wandering

In high school people used to tease me and ask me to do it on purpose and ""show them"". I never looked people in the eye and honestly 90% of the people who knew me for years never knew I had a lazy eye so I'm clearly good at hiding it. But it wrecks with my self esteem in the worst way I agree, and not just his face, but his movement and speech. IT was very clearly an alien imitating human-beings and they communicated that very well without having to actually outright say it. I've seen some compare the way IT moves to the alien from John Carpenter's The Thing, and I would agree. Did anyone else notice the supper creepy librarian lady standing behind Ben just after she gives him the book on the history of Derry?  Don't forget the parallel of Georgie being scared of the basement and then ending up as the monster in the basement! The basement scene had a nice throwaway scare that completely deflected me for the incoming child death. Yeah but in the book, he describes how Georgie's eyes were still open and he had a scared look on his face and for some reason that really stuck with me. Super creepy and dark.  You see him mouthing the words and then at one point you notice that his arm is holding Georgie and then he just slams Georgie down into the water. Brutal. I think I heard the infomercial on at least three occasions. Pretty much every scene with a television  [deleted] The emphasis on ""Take *It*"" was great. It's always a line that stood out for me Are you from the Middle East? Reference to the book and the sewer sex scene, presumably. Absolutely. I hated that stutter - you could see how fucking frustrating it was to that teenager that he couldn't defend his baby brother without getting stuck.  Really glad they didn't take it further. The becoming a women scene in the bathroom was fucking wild. Such a good movie.  They are also ""under the spell"" of IT. The adults in the community. So that also causes their 'additional darkness' demeanour.

It really does reflect people in societies - albeit a dramatised manner, for the movie.

But the way it's conveyed cuts deep, especially those who have suffered at the hands of Overt and *Covert* abuse.

* Co-dependency
* Narcissistic Abuse
* Complex-PTSD
* Munchausen by Proxy


Spreading the word on these can only help ""survivors"" to learn what's really going on.

Then they can start to heal..

And start to learn to Thrive.

P.S. That's what I love about the Reddit communities -- it's possible to reach thousands if not hundred thousands, particularly when it comes to actually advocating learning that everyone can grow from. I laughed way too hard when he got smacked with a rock as he yelled this Pennywise is an evil clown. You're supposed to feel scared and silly at the same time. I think the film did an awesome job at blending the two. Every step, the bass was getting louder and louder as it zoomed in on him. His whole head was unmoving but his body had a weird motion blur to it.  It was really unsettling. I did not notice that. Thinking about it now seems way more fucked up. Fuck that was a scary movie.  I think it was intentionally edited out for the trailers, just like Georgie's face decaying. Don't want to give too much away, ya know? My friend jist pointed out Bev's dad was watching the program that made the bully go full murderer. Implies the rapeyness was spurred on by Penny wise (like he augments fucked up traits that are already there) The adults of Derry were worse than the clown.

Think about that: the adults who are supposed to make you feel safe, are worse than a psychotic alien clown.  Call me crazy, but I think the pharmacist did look like Christopher Reeve. I dont think the mom is ever shown after the intro scene..its really sad in the book how it's emphasized that georgies room is untounched because the family cant accept what happened  I thought it was gonna be a 1 and done after the first pop out so my scare level went to 11 when the light came back and his big ass was still in there  The lady behind me screamed at the projection scene, then started giggling, followed by a loud snort. Hilarious. Exactly, this happens multiple times throughout the movie. Watch penny wise face whenever they don't get scared he makes a wtf face.  I think that's what it initially is supposed to mean, which I think is fucking sinister as all hell. I hope they show Pennywise fighting the Balrog mid-fall as the opening scene.  *high five!* The original 91 signatories to the Derry charter who went missing.  You too, one day, could be a creepy-ass, child murdering clown. Who's laughing now?! And his open eyes filled up with rain.  I thought that was the best part of the movie by far.  ""Take it.....t""

gave me shivers We've got a winner  Ah yes, the power of magic where what, 5 or 6 11-12 year olds running a train on Bev is somehow part of the ""ritual""?  As someone with a (very mild but still frustrating) stutter, they nailed it. That bit is directly out of the scene in the book too.  I was *so happy* they did that.   Managing to pull off a creepy clown in 2017 that wasn't too much of either is absurdly impressive. Yep, that connection is made explicit in the book. Bev even comments in the corresponding scene in the book that it's not _really_ her dad doing that, it's Pennywise influencing him. Adults were the real monsters in that town. I was confused on that part. Was IT responsible for all of the deaths in the town ?  Yaaaas 🎈 Wow. Do you have to find out if certain movies are censored or does your government flat out tell you that the movie has been ""edited and modified?"" Do they censor controversial/thematic parts of tame movies too? Like, in a Bugs Life where all the ants rise up to overthrow the grasshoppers? Would they just cut out that part and leave Flip getting the shit kicked out of him and cut to credits? I'm very curious about this, sorry! *And almost idly, in a kind of side-thought, Eddie discovered one of his childhood’s great truths. Grownups are the real monsters, he thought.*

*It was no big deal, not a thought that came in a revelatory flash or announced itself with trumpets and bells. It just came and was gone, almost buried under the stronger, overriding thought: I want my aspirator and I want to be out of here.* Yep. Every 27 years there would be some massacre of some sort and IT would ""feed"" and be sated.  In the book, It returns every 27 years after some sort of violent event occurs. So alot of the bad shit he isn't directly responsible for but moreso influenced it in a way. Then once he returns he goes to work and the disappearances begin. They kind of glossed over that in the movie, which is fine because that's alot of exposition to go through. No we're not told how much a movie is going to be censored or cut. Though sometimes movie theaters mention in their instagram posts the amount of time that has been cut from movies. 


Mostly nude, inappropriate clothing, sexual, and kissing scenes are the ones to be cut from movies. But also anything that contradicts with our culture, offends conservative people, may be inappropriate for children, or risks the stability of the country gets censored. 

 I'll mention some movies that were censored and you'll probably figure out why. 

• A scene in Ex Machina discussing whether being gay is a choice or not was cut. 

• Beauty and the Best was banned because of some gay scene

• All mentions of Superman being like a god were cut from MoS and BvS

• The plot of Fast7 revolved around a program named the Eye of God, the word God was censored everytime a character said the name of the program (basically God is censored if the name isn't used to refer to God himself)

• Scenes in 2012 depicting rich arab people were cut entirely from the movie. 

• Drax talking about his nipples and Ego's penis was cut from the movie. A scene where a lady in gold asking Chris Pratt to teach her how babies are made is also cut. 

• I remember a movie named Triple 9 had an Israeli-Russian guy in it. Some scenes mentioning Israel were cut. 

• Obviously any negative depiction of Arab governments is cut from movies. 

• Any scenes from Suicide Squad that had Harley's butt appear on screen were zoomed in to not show her butt. 

• Some local TV shows wanted to discuss minority oppression. The government didn't want this to be shown on TV or for these scenes to even be shot in the country so the director went to another country just to shoot these scenes and had his show on some other non-local channel. Government got pretty pissed but nothing happened. 

• Baby Kal El was cut from MoS because his penis was showing. 

• WonderWoman was banned because Gal is from Israel and because of religious themes as well. 

• For some reason MacGregor vs. Mayweather fight was banned. 

• The scalping scene from Inglorious Basterds was cut. 

• Scary scenes from the first Annabelle movie were cut as well. The movie basically became a comedy movie and everybody was just laughing the entire time. All we were able to see was characters reacting in fear to nothing.

Sometimes scenes aren't censored or cut but the subtitles are changed. 
For example in some movies god is translated to ""Sky"" in the subtitles.

35,"This was captivating.  And it should make more people interested in learning more about Fred Hampton and his work.  He was truly a case of a visionary cut down way too soon (he was only 21 when he was murdered).

Daniel, Lakeith, and Jesse Plemmons were all great in their roles as well.

It’s not really a biopic of Hampton though, which might surprise some people. Dominique Fishback should be getting praise, I think people are carrying unfair baggage from her role in Project Power, which is not good, also because she’s not the main focus of the movie, but she should be getting Best Supporting Actress noms left and right. There have been Best Supporting actress nominations given to worse performances in the past, she deserves at least some recognition.  Kaluuya has such a strong screen presence, his speech scenes were completely magnetic and commanded the screen. He handled the softer scenes well too, especially liked when he was laughing with his girlfriend and reflecting on Emmet Till. Stanfied's performance was reserved but he nailed it, the tears in his eyes when he has to put Hampton to sleep was excellent. I enjoyed the movie, even as someone who knows a bit about the Panthers and especially the Rainbow Coalition in Chicago. I would highly recommend the documentary *American Revolution 2* (Parts [1](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191346), [2](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191347), and [3](https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191348)) for those curious about the Rainbow Coalition, as well as [the PBS documentary](https://www.pbs.org/video/the-first-rainbow-coalition-q9hsug/). The Rainbow Coalition isn't given much attention, which disappointed me a little. But there's a lot to cover in a 2 hour movie while also telling the story of COINTELPRO. There seemed very little ""both sides"" kind of stuff going on. The police were absolutely villains throughout, as they should be. Which I appreciated. I can already predict the outrage from right-wingers and police unions about the depiction of killings of police officers. While there wasn't needless both sides kind of stuff, there obviously was the humanizing of O'Neal and the depiction of Mitchell in some shades of grey. But I think it does well to show the insidious way the system gets people to carry out oppression.

One very small detail of the movie that I appreciated was the reference to [intercommunalism](https://viewpointmag.com/2018/06/11/intercommunalism-the-late-theorizations-of-huey-p-newton-chief-theoretician-of-the-black-panther-party/) at the beginning of the film. [There's a good talk over this theory developed by Huey P Newton by the author of the linked article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bpS49ytdm4). The way various Panthers developed theories of revolutionary socialism I am also interested in, [like Lorenzo Komboa Ervin](https://blackrosefed.org/announcing-black-autonomy-podcast/) who is still around. [Kuwasi Balagoon](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273895582_Maroon_Kuwasi_Balagoon_and_the_Evolution_of_Revolutionary_New_Afrikan_Anarchism) is another who is no longer around, who [has inspired](https://cooperationjackson.org/lumumba-center) groups like [Cooperation Jackson](https://cooperationjackson.org/) that [build and fight for a better world](https://truthout.org/articles/build-and-fight-the-program-and-strategy-of-cooperation-jackson/). Many Panthers are still incarcerated [or did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o05OYFKHpew) very long [stints in prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxxnjlJ2nNo). [The Jericho Movement](https://thejerichomovement.com/) was [founded by ex-Panthers](https://www.treyfpodcast.com/2020/07/28/47-ashanti-alston/) that [now support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKrpMLDyev0) the many political prisoners from various movements. The [echoes of the Panthers and their politics run through anti-prison movements today](https://incarceratedworkers.org/freedom-first), which are [happening right now](https://rampantmag.com/2021/02/09/this-is-genocide/). Anyone catch how when Mitchell was handing Bill the keys to the gas station, it looked like silver pieces? Kaluuya was captivating from start to finish. Also Plemmons once again nailing this role of seemingly harmless yet deeply disturbing villain. Gave me vibes of Todd from Breaking Bad where he seems gentle but clearly inside he's void and capable of some messed up stuff. The scene where Bill asks if he's going to kill Fred was so heartbreaking. It was that desperation in Bill's voice ""you won, what more do you want"" and Plemmons' soulless eyes that really made it clear who he was. Damn I loved this movie. Kaluuya and Stanfield were amazing of course. I specifically loved Kaluuya’s take on Fred Hampton. The way he just observes and hangs on to every word someone is saying in a conversation is a great touch. 

I also loved how Shaka King explores the Black Panther Party in this. The scene where Ms. Winters is grieving over her son and says something along the lines of “Yeah he did that...but that shouldn’t be his legacy.” I took that as to how the Black Panthers are still viewed today. Yeah they were militant, and they took extreme measures in practicing their second amendment rights; but they did so protecting their neighborhoods from a tyrannical unjust system, the amount of good they did for the people in their neighborhoods shouldn’t be overlooked, from the money they put into it and the clinics they’ve built. 

Anyway, great film. Definitely will be taking advantage of its HBO Max run. The ‘I AM A REVOLUTIONARY’ scene inside the church is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is Kaluuya’s performance incredible but the scene has so much stakes involved for All the characters that elevates this very powerful Hampton speech to an amazing scene. With constant shots to Fred’s pregnant girlfriend, as well as the back and forth between Stanfield and Plemmons the tension keeps rising to a fever pitch, the scene is just perfect. That scene in the prison where the guy has RABBLE ROUSER carved into his chest really drove fear into me. Jesus, what a performance from Daniel Kaluuya and what a shocking story (I'm not from America and didn't know of this movement). This film was quite a surprise for me, I thought it was brilliant. Man, I haven't watched a movie like this in a while where I just needed to stare into the void after finishing it and just think. Fred Hampton was 21 years old when he died... Wow. That blew my mind. Great acting and compelling story that will be new to a lot of people. But it also felt really surface level at points in depicting Fred Hampton's life, the Rainbow Coalition, how the BPP served their community, their beliefs, and the depth of what COINTELPRO did. Hey Reddit I'm late to the page, but as a producer on this movie just want to thank everyone for watching and for discussing as always.

I HIGHLY recommend the official podcast that we also produced that goes far deeper into the Black Panther party during this time, as well as some fascinating information about how we put the film together along with Chairman Fred Hampton Jr.s' support.

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/judas-and-the-black-messiah-podcast/id1549883019 Kaluuya deserves to win the Oscar, he’s put in many phenomenal performances over the past few years. Also, thank you HBO Max for not being totally greedy like Disney and allowing the public to watch these impactful films. I believe the Lucas Bros., the twins from 22 Jump Street, have writing credits on this as well. Masterclass performances by Kaluuya and Stanfield. Cinematography was sharp and stunning, felt like I was watching an art house film at times. The use of old footage overlaid with speeches and chants was extremely effective. Definitely a front runner for oscars. The climactic scene where Hampton is unconscious while all this shit is going down just turned my stomach. Awful (but brilliantly done). Outstanding movie that deserves the highest level of recognition possible. Stanfield and Kaluuya were incredible. Also, Deborah Johnson was a great supporting actress as well. I think she should be nominated. Cinematography and soundtrack for this were pristine as well.

This movie is perfect timing and I agree with one of the movie critics who said that this movie doesn't hold back in showing police as the true villains during the civil rights movement.

Just the fact that they manipulated a 17 year old to infiltrate the Black Panthers to not only imprison a 23-year-old Fred Hampton, but also to murder him speaks volumes for why black people feel the way we do about law enforcement. It also illustrates them planting a crabs in a barrel mentality in the black community. They cornered O'neal to poison him and give up the blueprint to his location. 

**99 shots fired by the police, 1 fired back from the Black Panthers.**

99 shots for a man who was asleep with his pregnant girlfriend.

Just absolutely fucking sickening. And then they turn around and arrest them for attempted murder. The cops were fucking smiling in pictures when they removed his body. 

A 12 year trial that starts at 47 million for damages and settles at less than 2 million.

Someone mentioned Do the Right Thing, which cinematically takes place ~20 years later and both movies do a great job at showing that the more time passes, the more things stay the same.

Excellent movie, excellent depiction of a story, and much needed for the culture. The title of this movie perfectly describes what happens in the movie. And even figuring that going in, it still emotionally destoryed me. Such a great movie! Anytime you get Daniel Kaluuya, Lakeith Stanfield, and Lil Rel Howery in a movie together, you know it’s gonna be fire Mods somehow decided to delete an earlier thread for the same movie with a lot more participation.

Even one of the film's producer commented on it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/litkiu/discussion_judas_and_the_black_messiah Daniel Kaluuya deserves every award he could possibly get for his portrayal of Fred Hampton. There were times when he wasn't onscreen that I legitimately missed his presence; that's how you know he was fantastic. Kaluuya was amazing; His best performance yet. But, this movie and movies like it are always tough, even more so due to the fact that my mother, a former Black Panther, passed away last year due dementia. She is the strongest person I've ever known and we were best friends. 

The leg work the FBI did to destroy and dismantle just about every black empowerment  movement crushes me every time I'm reminded of it. My mother was an angel, but what she endured when she moved from Jersey to Georgia was terrible. Racists being in power have this God-forsaken phobia of minorities, and the means to which they will take to eradicate any movement is absolutely ridiculous. Hoover and racists like him always made it seem like the safety of the country is dependent on minorities being oppressed (a tactic still used till this day). But, each movement (NAACP, Black Panther etc)  was sparked by the murder of Emmitt Till and the thousands of other senseless murders of minorities. This country will never get to where it needs to be until the powers that be listen with open ears to people who can convey the ""Black"" experience properly with the goal of putting pieces in place to eliminate this state and corporate-sanctioned bigotry hatred. This America that we are in now is better than the one my mother grew up in, but we still have a lonngggg way to go.

This film did a great job of conveying why the Black Panthers existed; It was never to push fear, only preservation. Hampton Jr. was robbed of a father, the nation was robbed of a Kennedy, of a King, all because of this phobia of minorities.

I miss you mom... I still don't like framing the film through O'Neal's perspective (for a variety of reasons) but this film might not have gotten made otherwise. Shout out to Chairman Fred Hampton Jr. for being on set pretty much every day and correcting all kinds of misinformation, even when Warner Bros. tried to stop him (and shout out to Ryan Coogler for fighting for him to stay involved). A lot of people don't realize how different this film is due to Chairman Fred Jr. fighting battles day in and day out. A few facts I'd like to highlight that aren't necessarily presented in the film are 1) O'Neal was not the only informant, in fact it is believed that Mitchell alone had 9 others who are still not identified, and 2) COINTELPRO didn't die with Hoover, these are systemic tactics that the State utilizes to this day. Chairman Fred Sr.'s tombstone is shot up by cops regularly, and there are a number of Black Panther Party members who were targeted that are still locked up as political prisoners to this day.

From a historical standpoint it may not be perfect, but as Chairman Fred Jr. told me a few days ago, ""You can't put a shark in a fish tank"". I hope the film performs well and opens the door for future projects that can more fully flesh out the politics of the Black Panther Party (imagine a series focusing on different BPP Chapters per season!). In the meantime I look forward to the discussions of the film and strongly encourage people to research the subject. For a good start I'll recommend watching the documentaries [The Murder of Fred Hampton](https://vimeo.com/434141029) and [All Power to the People](https://youtu.be/pKvE6_s0jy0), and be sure to check out [the Judas and the Black Messiah Podcast](https://medium.com/prxofficial/proximity-99-invisible-and-warner-bros-15e4d6ac8b4c) that provides historical context from Chairman Fred Jr. and actual members of the Illinois Chapter of the BPP. [deleted] It's a shame most people will see this on HBO max not in theaters, this is one of those movies that I feel it's one those movies like 1917,  Mad max furry road, or 2001, we're seeing it on a big screen with the movie stereo, helps you further appreciate the film and helps you connect better.

This movie remind me of like a historical epic in the way shots are framed to fit a giant screen, the colors poped more and the sound mixing is done so that certain sounds are done for certain audio channels of theater.

It made me remember why i love movies, and made me sad too see people losing interest in the theatrical experiences,To me this movie only reaffirms why should not go away, as I feel it wouldn't make the same emotional impact if i was watching this on my 42 inch tv  on my couch with the sunlight pouring in and random discrations Daniel Kaluuya deserves an oscar for his performance Anyone else look up Fred Hampton speeches after watching this? Daniel Kaluuya nailed the voice.

LaKeith outstanding as expected. These guys are gonna win awards.

When they put up the text at the end saying Chairman Fred was only 21 years old. Man, if you didn’t know that before seeing this movie you’d probably assume he was a bit older like late 20s or 30 similar to Kaluuya. It’s absolutely crushing. [deleted] My favorite moment was kind of small in the scheme of things but it made me go ""This movie is amazing""

When >!Lakeith Stanfield chases Lil Rel Howery's character to the car and goes ""I'm gonna need to see a badge."" And Rel hands him his own same fake FBI badge from the beginning scene. He looks at it in shock and the same musical trumpet cue goes off. Amazing filmmaking!< Not to be negative but didn’t anyone feel like the film was lacking a narrative? And some scenes just felt pasted in there.  Also didn’t feel there was much of a development between O Neal and Hampton. Felt he rose too quickly.  

Idk I felt underwhelmed. I commented on another discussion thread my thoughts on Kaluuya and Stanfield’s exceptional performances, and how I hoped this movie inspires many to research our government’s failings throughout history. 

Another revolutionary that isn’t well known is Steve Biko in South Africa. He was a medical student that created and led the anti-apartheid Black Consciousness movement, coined the term “Black is beautiful”, and helped organize healthcare centers in Black neighborhoods throughout South Africa. He was arrested for leaving his hometown, was severely beaten, and murdered by the police at the age of 30. If you’re interested in Hampton’s story, I recommend reading into Biko as well Liked them leaning into the religious angle of the title for the final sequence. 

Judas being given the pieces of silver (Bill getting silver keys for his gas station)

Fred declining the money to go on the run and instead open up a clinic (Jesus announced this is my body given to you. You could argue Fred was exchanging his body to prison for the medical clinic) and just generally preparing them for his absence. 

They were all drinking some kind of red drink, reminiscent of the wine at the last supper, which would later become part of the communion ceremony. 

And the fact the last scene was literally Fred and his lieutenants having a last meal together. 

It was moving imagery for a heartbreaking end to the story, but tied the theme up nicely. My only gripe with the movie is that it didn’t show more of the good that the Black Panthers did for their community — the after school programs, soup kitchens, arming citizens, informing people of their rights, etc.

It definitely touched on those aspects, but more so in conversation rather than on screen. Instead, it showed a lot of cop killings which was only a small part of their manifesto.

Overall, it was an incredible movie and more revolutionaries need their own biopics because the medium of film is often times the best way to inform the public of our unsung heroes. I was so furious at Bill at the end of the of movie, but when I found out he commit suicide it made me realize even though he lacked integrity he was SO young (20 when Fred was murdered), and ultimately a victim of a system so heavily stacked against him. I imagine there were some nights he would lie awake and wish he had been murdered instead so as not to live with the guilt. 

This movie was the first I'd learned of Fred Hampton and I was riveted by his message and the story. I am dying to watch the eyes on the prize episode with the william o'neal interview but I can't find the second season anywhere. Has any one else been able to find it? Also the director of the series is named Henry Hampton, is there any relation? as much as I love LaKeith in pretty much everything he does, I really think a younger actor should’ve had the role. pretty big deal of a 17 year old being bullied into becoming an FBI informant is pretty much completely overlooked by the film The character of Judy was a total BADASS.

I read the actress portraying her was cast as Ironheart on Disney Plus. This film is everything I hoped it would be, so fucking powerful. Really needed this right now

Kaluuya needs an Oscar

I only had limited knowledge of Fred Hampton and his story, but I’m diving straight into everything I can find after that I remember 15 years ago Plemons was just the sidekick pal on Friday Night Lights. Dude has had the best career of any FNL alum besides Michael B. Jordan. Best movie I've seen all year. Kaluuya and Stanfield were amazing. I really hope Kaluuya gets recognized for this.

The story itself is fucked up and makes me so angry and sad. The FBI has assassinated so many people even back home in PR I have read of very similar executions. Kaluuya has made a career of being a character in movies who trust the wrong people. Fantastic movie and I only have two complaints. 

1) Kaluuya and Stanfield gave wonderful performances but they're each 10 years too old and I found it distracting the entire time.

2) the movie sort of frames the FBI's concern with the Panthers as primarily based on racism and sort of downplays the concern over a proletariat uprising.

I feel like both of these things sort of diminish how great Fred Hampton was and how barbaric and evil the FBI are. incredible film, all cops are bastards, what absolute cunts. I just want to qualify what I say next by saying I can never know the true power of emotion this must raise with Black people— because I am White. But i have known poverty much of my life and know police brutality personally.

I cried out with a pronouncement of rage multiple times while watching this. For much of my adult life, I had convinced myself that society was filled with fools who couldn’t see reality as it truly is. Then, a film like this illustrates how obvious it always has been— and how much that fact compounds the hopelessness for the future. War, and Politics.

Politics, and War.

What are you prepared to do?

All the power, to all the People. Has anyone found a way to watch the full second season of Eyes on the Prize II (where they said it had the informant's only ever documented interview)? I found the text transcript but find it fucking bizarre that only the first season of that series is online from what I can see. I shed a few tears as I do with almost any Black film. When I was younger I never understood what my dad meant, what him being hard on me was about. Being a little bit older I understand a bit more, of what it means to be a Black Man in America, and my dads angle. The Young Patriots scene is important, so important today to Black people in my generation. This is a fight that can only and will be won by coming together in arms, no matter the color. I knew about the Black Panthers as a kid... What Black kid doesn't. But the FBI??????? I love the movies/shows uncovering the truth of Systemic Racism, the truth of how the FBI plotted and successfully destroyed the Black community. I'm surprised on how much I liked this film. I was amazed by the performances of Kaluuya and Stanfield Best movie I've seen in a while This movie makes me so angry about all the 'Judged in the History Books' BS. What kind of justice is it if the people involved aren't punished in their lifetime and get to spew their bs. Imagine how much less harm there would have been if Hoover was punished at that time instead of being judged by the History Books Oscars for everyone! Shoutout to Keith and Kenny Lucas (Lucas Twins) for also working on the script! They got some bright futures ahead, as long as they don’t come across no “twin haters.” My biggest complaint with the movie is that I still think of Jesse Plemons as the bully from Like Mike so it’s weird for him to play a character with kids I just feel really like down and sad after watching this. It was really powerful but also very heartbreaking. I really hope this wins an oscar. The fact that he was only 21 is insane. Idk if it takes away or adds to the story. Like a whole movement following a 21 year seems ridiculous by today’s standards but at the same time it also helps me appreciate how charismatic he was. Is this movie a Best Picture contender? This is Kaluuyas best role yet and every scene he is in just hooked me. Easily the best portrayal of Hampton yet. Lakeiths performance is more understated and grounded which complements Kaluuyas performance. I love the grainy jazz soundtrack that plays throughout the movie and the other technicals of the movie are great as well. I didn’t know that Hampton died at 21 and for someone to be so eloquent and powerful at his age is extremely rare. I also think it’s one of the better portrayals of the black panther or black liberation movements I’ve seen. It shows the morals of the group and that what they were doing was reactionary to years of injustice such as the slaying of a peaceful protester like MLK. Lakith had some real hot dog guy from Tim Robindon energy after he gets the security gig. Um, why can’t I see any comments?

Edit: never mind, must’ve been a glitch What happened here? Goddamn phenomenal and heartbreaking movie, way better than Trial of the Chicago 7 (which I really enjoyed, btw). It was one of those films where every performance was powerful and memorable in some way. Daniel Kaluuya was absolutely mesmerizing in every moment. Lakeith Stanfield brought that same nervous, paranoid, mischievous energy to this role as he did in Sorry to Bother You, and it was very interesting seeing Bill gradually get more invested in the movement. And Jesse Plemons, man, I was really reminded of Todd from Breaking Bad in some of his later scenes with Stanfield. The conversation in the restaurant where he orders Hampton killed was bone-chilling. The film was amazing but I did have a small nitpick that it doesn’t hit you that Fred was only 21 and William was only 19 because of the actors who play them. But that doesn’t stop their performances from being absolutely incredible Daily reminder that Jesse Plemons is an amazing actor This movie will be insanely hard to top by any other movie this year IMO. A real story told in such a raw way, the range of emotions I felt while watching this....wow. The whole cast did such a great job too. Having rewatched The trial of the Chicago 7 before hand, this film really gave me more context on how beloved and important Fred Hampton was to the Black Panthers. Kaluuya, Stanfield, and Plemons were phenomenal in their role. They absolutely deserve nominations. [deleted] Ah perfect, I was just looking for this post.

I thought it was good, not great.  They nailed the Fred Hampton parts, which is all you really need.  But other things were not ideal.  The music, eh.  I thought Dominique Fishback playing Fred Hampton's girlfriend in her first 2 scenes was not good.  Sometimes it felt like a big budget movie, and sometimes it felt like a streaming movie.

But man, it had me thinking about how all the big black political leaders of the 60's were either killed or ended up in jail.  MLK, Malcolm X, Fred Hampton.  If Fred Hampton hadn't died he would have be 72 years old now.  All these black leaders could have been active for all of the modern era. Fuck all the cop pigs who shoot chairman Fred’s grave stone. I piss on their graves I hope this movie puts Shaka King on some people’s radar. 

This ensemble was fantastic. Sort of an after thought with all these great performances, but Martin Sheen playing the menacing FBI chief was a treat.

Kaluuya’s voice work was also TOP notch. [deleted] What an excellent film. Daniel Kaluuya was absolutely masterful Great movie. The whole time I wished I could see more of the Rainbow Coalition and the massive humanitarian works done by the Black Panthers, but totally got it is not all possible in a 2 hour movie. I also dreaded seeing his murder, I had read the witness accounts of it and really hoped they would Lincoln it and not show it but allude to it, but alas to be effective we had to see it, and they portrayed it spot on. 

The other thought I had is that Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were not directly murdered by the US Government, at least that we know of. However had evil men not beaten them to it the Government most definitely would have murdered both men just as they did Fred Hampton. Incredible film. Masterful in the same way a Scorsese film is and in many ways Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield feel like they could be this generation's Pacino and DeNiro too. Kaluuya and Lakeith are getting all the praise and deservedly so. But I also wanted to shoutout Dominique Fishback. Just a beautifully understated performance and between this and Project Power, I'm really impressed with her range. Definitely an actress to watch. I feel sick after watching this film. How did we get here? What happened to the Revolution? Sometimes when I’m reminded of how long the fight for justice has been happening, it makes me feel so powerless. I wish I could do more. The acting in this movie absolutely should be getting at least 2 Oscar noms. Out of this world. The loud brash energy in Kaluuya vs. The quiet storm from Stanfield. It jumps off the screen and grabs you. I did a podcast on it, if anyone is interested:

[Review of both the movie and the soundtrack ](https://anchor.fm/mikethemush/episodes/E1-Judas--The-Black-Messiah-Movie--Soundtrack-eqnm46) I really enjoyed this film, but something random that irked me were the ""Hollywood"" gun scenes; like the shootout where apparently everyone is shooting 12 guage deer slugs at 50 yds and the scene where they go to the Crown's bar, where upon exiting, the leader follows them to the door with a cocked revolver- pointing at the back of several of his gang members heads along the way... this is nitpicking but it takes me out of the story momentarily when stuff like that happens Saw this last night and really enjoyed. If Daniel Kaluuya doesn't at least get a nomination for this, then awards are pointless. I grew up watching all this unfold, but from the perspective of network news. They didn't tell all the good things the Black Panthers did because there was just barest of safety nets.  I also love that it was done from several perspectives and not a one sided affair. Reminds me of Black KKKlansman, but with a sad ending. Be sure and watch after you might think it ends, because it doesn't. Highly recommend. I just finished this up and what a well cast film. I personally want to see anything that involves Stanfield, Plemons was great again and Kaluuya has hit ever since I saw him in Black Mirror Such a great movie!!! Lakeith and Daniel were excellent!! As were the rest of the cast!!! I was so captivated from start to finish, man I wish I can rewatch this for the first time again. I thought the film was good. I'd probably give it 4/5 overall. I thought the performances overall were incredible. I thought Martin Sheen as Hoover was way over the top and cartoonish, though. Hoover should have been so terrifying and the malignant presence he really was, wasn't translated as effectively as it could have been. 

I also believe the film tried to take a shotgun approach to telling this story vs something a little more exacting. By trying to split time between Hampton and O'Neal's stories we really didn't get to truly dive deep into either character the way we should have. I rarely say this, but this film could have been longer. The pacing was strange at times and, for the reason I mentioned, it felt like the film was just covering things to connect the dots of the plot. 

I ultimately was left wanting at the end, and I wonder if a more adept director would have been able to do more with this story. Ultimately, I am so happy this film was made as it's so important that the United States never forgets the heroes like Hampton, Seale, Newton, et al. These people were the victims of a concerted, state run operation to eradicate revolutionary groups that were fighting to unite the people. If this film enlightens people to what the US has done to it's own people, then I think that's most important. As excellent as the two lead performances were, I do think the movie missed something by not casting younger actors. Fred Hampton was only 21, and William O'Neal was 20 when the events of the movie happened, and that just makes it so much more tragic. Daniel Kaluuya is the best actor alive right now. If he started a cult I would join. Unbelievably charismatic. Kaluuya was excellent! Thought Stanfield was overacting a bit but still did a great job. Plemons’ character was all over the place. Feel like it could have used another 20ish minutes, as I would have loved to see more of O’Neal’s life outside of the Black Panthers. Overall 7.8/10. As a movie I think it ran a bit long and had a lot of issues with pacing. It feels like different movies at times, shifting between O'Neal (maintaining his cover, feeling divided about being a betrayer to a greater cause, etc.), Hampton (his relationship with Deborah, his teachings and speeches), Roy Mitchell (his scenes coercing O'Neal into doing unsavory things contrasted with his uncomfortable reactions to what his FBI colleagues are telling him about how they're conducting the operation) and the miscellaneous Black Panther perspectives. It was really well-acted but for the most part felt bloated to me. 

The movie does finish really strong however, the assassination of Fred Hampton was intense and really powerful. The end describing events that followed, while disappointingly in text, was also shocking. It made me want to read more about the lawsuit and what happened to O'Neal. Overall it was thought-provoking but I think as a movie it was a bit on the messier side. How did the end make you guys feel? I may be wrong, I may have ZERO empathy, but I felt like Bill was a traitor through & through. He chose HIMSELF over an entire movement..no kids, no wife..could’ve came to Jesus as to speak at any time but still walked out. What would his son think of him? He’s no hero.

Totally not the same, but that final scene gave me vibes of “Wonderland” & I almost didn’t watch it. The parallels to today in this movie are insane & it shows you how these negative phrases are so tired..even back in the 70’s they were using words such as communists, leftists to dehumanize people simply asking for equality. FBI shot 90+ bullets into Fred Hamptons residence while he was sleeping, LMPD shot 30+ into Breonna Taylor’s residence...both were innocent & the state sanctioned murders 50 fucking years apart. The fact that her killers are walking the street free men, shows us that this system STILL really hasn’t changed I loved it. Lakeith is such a movie star, one of those actors that is so watchable that he elevates everything he’s in. But the movie is really good too. With streaming movies I appreciate ones that feel actually cinematic and not just like a made for HBO movie. Not gonna lie, this is the first movie to make me cry in a while. I didn't even fucking expect to but honestly, really, it broke my fucking heart. Quite interested about reactions from breadtube/chaposphere since its very rare to have films about outright left figures(One Night in Miami brimg anpther). The recent Chicago 7 film by Sorkin has been widely dunked on by leftist for Sorkin's portrayal of Hoffman and Seele so I'm curious to see how this movie about BPP does with lefties. This movie pairs well with the Trail of the Chicago Seven film. At one point the Chicago Seven trail is mentioned in this film (The drawing of Bobby Seale with the gag). It will give you more perspective of just how treacherous the FBI and Hoover were. There were some great fking moments in this movie everyone did a fantastic job in there perspective role very captivating Hmm, I dunno how to feel about this movie. I was really looking forward to it and the trailer blew me away. But I guess I'd say I was disappointed. It was by no means a bad movie, but it felt lacking.

I think the main thing it was missing for me was I feel there should have been more of a connection between Daniel and Lakeith's characters. The two barely interact throughout the movie and their last major interaction before the night Fred dies was them fighting over Bill's suggestion of blowing up a government building. And then they don't really have any big interaction that last night, just Bill offering to refill Fred's drink

I didn't really feel any sympathy for Bill's plight, I don't feel there was any real moment where he starts to question what he's doing. I thought maybe the blowing up the building thing was all him, but then you see he had a wire so it was just more scheming.

I know it's a historical drama, so perhaps this really was the extent of their relationship, but as a narrative film, I feel they really needed more of a closer relationship. They at least should have had a bigger final scene together beyond just Bill standing off to the side before swooping in to offer Fred a refill so he can drug him. I feel they could have fudged this a bit more to make a more interesting narrative.

As is, the movie feels like two largely unconnected halves, the Bill side and the Fred side. It's a shame because there were a lot of great performances in this movie, but it just didn't really hit home for me. What an amazing movie Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield are such great actors.  I'm definitely going to watch more movies from this director. Goddamn... what a brutal ending. The scene were they went and formed the Rainbow Coalition invoked such an overwhelming sense of hope in my heart it left tears streaming down my face and my heart quivering. If any scene from this film should be remembered, it should be that one. The whole point is fear guarantees control. 
In terms of the actual film and its cross referencing of biblical cannon which we as the viewers have to acknowledge, I also saw the similarities shred with the film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. A prophet of their time cut down by a puppet of a greater evil. 
As a veteran the conflict concludes in this: the American government, the ruling party, will NOT allow defeat, Outside or in, as it is against its nature which has to be accepted by any understanding of any revolutionary. It will do everything in its power at any cost of its soul to retain the power. Evils aside the words of the constitution and bill of rights demand freedom for the people and the means to think and defend said rights. To retain the power. This is the biggest hypocrisy to exist. We, as the people, are able to witness this hypocrisy, call it into question, and ratify it as the true power is within our hands. Under no organization outside our borders or brewed within them shall trump those words and hoist their flag over the capital or the grounds it represents. The argument against this logic has always directly lead to their demise. The people of this country have to abandon their fear to not only uphold this solemn promise of freedom and equality but preserve it under the flag of the United States. 
My heart broke the moment when the government, soiled in fear, sold out another chunk of its soul and killed in the name of fear. The people shall reign over this land. It’s hard to compartmentalize how I feel about this film and my politics. This movie made me feel sick, and if that was the intention, they did right by Fred Hampton.

Daniel Kaluuya is one of the best actors of this generation. 

Rest in Power, Fred Hampton. Here is the documentary referenced at the end of the film. It took me some time to hunt down. Here is the episode on the Black Panthers from that pbs documentary series, Eyes on the Prize.

I am willing to bet I could find them all with just a little more googling or binging. What the hell happened in this thread? Between Sorry to bother you, Get out, Knives out, uncut gems, and this, Lakeith Stanfield is set to be a household name if he keeps up his phenomonal performances. I wish this film focused more on Hampton instead of focusing on the internal conflict of Bill O'Neil. It made for a great thriller but was ultimately toothless in terms of really showing the true power of Hampton. I said this when I saw it at Sundance, that it checks all the right boxes with the right people so thats why it is so highly reviewed. I found myself wanting. Posh Kenneth has come a long way. I thought for sure somehow at the dinner table the money was gonna be a on-the-nose reference to the 30 pieces of silver that Judas got...I'm glad they avoided that. Chilling that he killed himself shortly after the interview aired. Fantastic movie, hope it gets the recognition it deserves. I respect how Lakeith does indie prestige films as well as studio projects. Nice to change it up every now and then! An amazing movie that really got me interested in reading and watching more about the Black Panthers — thanks for failing me, U.S. education system. Daniel Kaluuya is incredible. Goddamn, the fact that the police dialogue from the ending raid scene was lifted from actual witness accounts is... just fucking nauseating I had chills when the policemen came into Hampton’s apartment. This scene was so well done. 

Between the initial knock on the door and the last frame of Deborah’s face as she was being handcuffed, Shaka King did such a phenomenal job portraying this moment and all of the fear, anger, sadness and confusion that came with it. So so so sooooooo good on King’s part. This movie was awesome Riz/Raci vs Kahlua/Stanfield LETS FUCKIN GO UM this thread needs be bigger This was so good. Much, much better than The Trial of the Chicago 7. Kaluuya deserves to win an Oscar. fred hampton's son burned down a korean grocery store during the LA riots Why are there no comments in the thread? This is probably an unpopular opinion about the film, but I think it starts super strong and just gets weaker as the film goes on. I absolutely loved the Revolutionary scene, but I just found narrative getting weaker and more political as the movie went on. I don't have a problem with a movie being political, in fact I enjoy it, but I'd rather watch a documentary on Fred than a mostly-true film on his life if the narrative is going to become secondary to the politics of the movie. Eveeytime I watch a Daniel Kahlua movie: I love your eyes,man. Kaluuya really nailed the voice and speech patterns down, god damn. Fred Hampton could not wake up because he was drugged by Bill O'Neal.

Even though Bill was extremely shakey when he offered Fred the drink, Fred still trusted him.

That really gets the magnitude of the betrayal across. Daniel Kaluuya is such an incredible and charismatic actor. He truly has a bright future. The acting was probably the film's best element. 

The plot structure, however, is pretty familiar and traditional, and I wish the direction was a little more inspired. It's a fascinating and important story nonetheless, and it's certainly still on my mind a day after watching it. 

By the way, everyone should watch One Night in Miami if they haven't already. Another amazing acting showcase that has also stayed with me since. Movie makes a great double bill with the recent FBI/MLK focetary about the FBI going after MLK.

Another good biopic this reminded me if off was Milk/Life and Times of Harvey Milk about the assassination of activist figures. Fred was only 21 

Jesus Such a fantastic film! I saw it with maybe 5 people here a few hours ago in Baton Rouge. 

This film deserves nominations across the board. Fantastic. One of the best movies I’ve seen in a while. Agree with everyone putting it out there that these actors are too old to drive home the youth of the characters when this happened, but both Stanfield and Kaluuya were outstanding. Excellent cinematography and the musical cues scattered throughout the film almost reminded me of the jarring soundtrack of “killing em softly”. The past few years certainly look like a renaissance of black film in America and this is one of the crowning achievements. I thought Judas and Black Messiah was good, not the best thing ever but still good. I like its portrayal of the BPP. Ending hit hard too. For those with the equipment for it the Atmos track is pretty awesome for this movie. 

Especially when the guy jumps on the roof of the car. 

Actually scared me for a second. Lakeith Stanfield is one of my favorite actors, but this is the second movie I’ve seen with Kaluuya and I can see his range in just this and Get Out already. I these two guys, along with Plemmons, have really long and great careers. Daniel Kaluuya is incredible in this. Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal was pretty powerful. End of the movie still has me pretty angry and I don't know why. It's been a hard couple of years, I had a chance to listen to a lot of fear & terror expressed by some of my co-workers in reaction to George Floyd's death. Unfortunately none of this new, but I watch foreign sporting events (ex. English Premier League) and see players of all nationalities & creed take a knee against racism. Contrast that against the attitudes of Americans that are supposed to be our fellow countrymen. There's a lot of anger simmering & this movie, Kaluuya's speeches touched on that. this review pretty much summed up my thoughts: [https://www.vulture.com/amp/article/judas-and-the-black-messiah-movie-review-hbo-max.html](https://www.vulture.com/amp/article/judas-and-the-black-messiah-movie-review-hbo-max.html) Kaluuya was such a great actor, but man in the end when I saw that Fred was only 21 and that clip of his, I now think that someone younger should've been cast. I watched the whole movie thinking Fred was around 30-35 year old. This was a good film. But I am a bit conflicted about the fact that it is framed as a Fred Hampton biopic when in reality the film doesn't flesh him out as much as you'd expect. The film arguably spends more time on O'Neal than it does on Hampton and it was honestly a bit jarring to witness.  
Additionally, Martin Sheen as J. Edgar Hoover needed more screen time because I felt it would have added a lot more to the film to have him as the looming dark villain pulling the strings from behind the scenes.

The shootout scene was INCREDIBLE imo. Felt like a gut punch and carried so much emotional weight.  
The direction was also very good and Kaluuya's charismatic performance was incredible, but I feel Lakeith Stanfield stands out as the star of this film. Could have been better, but could have been much worse.   
With all that said, I really enjoyed it! I was so excited for this movie and went in with high expectations. It’s overall fine, but I feel like it was a big missed opportunity considering the subject matter. Almost seemed like the movie was 3-4 different screenplays stitched together, and I really struggled to get into it

That said, Kaluuya deserves the Oscar. And Lakeith Stanfield also deserves a ton of praise Goddamn was this powerful. I haven't seen all of the contenders yet (Minari, Nomadland, Mank) but it's definitely my favorite one so far. The two leads are fucking fantastic & the ending was jawdropping. History repeats itself, over & over again. Alex Rackley was not an informant.

2 Informants remain. I liked it What a great movie. >truly a case of a visionary cut down way too soon

The State wasn't scared of ""black power."" They were scared of Hampton creating a multiracial coalition of the disenfranchised. 

They still are. > not really a biopic of Hampton though, which might surprise some people.



There was an artist that refused to be on the soundtrack after she learned it wasn’t a true biopic. Personally, from what I know about Fred’s life a biopic wouldn’t be the route to go, this dude was damn near perfect on paper, and biopics are only generally good if they either show conflict within the subject(Malcolm X was a good example of this), or the person lived long enough to experience a wealth of different experiences that make for good viewing. Unfortunately Fred never got that opportunity.


He was a straight A student who played his football, went to college and got in the struggle early to help out the people. i was pretty annoyed at how little they actually covered fred hampton's work, which is the reason he was murdered in the first place. not surprising coming from hollywood though. This movie was recommended to me by a friend who is (and always has been) very vocal about his interest in, and support of, the black panther party and different civil rights movements in the past. He went on and on and on about Fred Hampton before watching this. I totally get it now. Completely. Hampton was a force to be reckoned with— especially at 21, like....just wow. Definitely doing more research now. She deserves more praise for sure. Her final scene was heartbreaking. She's great, and while Project Power was silly, I thought she showed obvious talent in it. Glad to see her getting opportunities and doing well in more substantial films. [deleted] i think she was as just great as kaluuya. her project power role couldn't be farther from this role. she's a great actress. and her chemistry with kaluuya was amazing. What was that admirable about her performance? I know I’m late to this but just watched it. I didn’t think she was particularly good and seemed kinda like a forced archetype of a character. I thought she did well, but just as one would expect from a professional actor - not best supporting actress worthy. Idk though. 

Her scene in the church was great as you could see her battling between her support for the movement and her sadness about Fred as an inevitable martyr. Really? Thought she was the weakest of the bunch Never seen project power but she’s excellent in The Deuce I don’t think it’s baggage from Project Power, I just think people are overlooking her cause of the star performances of both leads. He's just captivating in everything. Black Mirror, Get Out, Widows, Queen & Slim, now this. He's just so good. Today's abolitionist movement is growing stronger every day. If people want to get involved, now is the time. Whatever this movie does, I hope desperately that it brings more people into the movement. Have you seen Agnes Varda's short documentary Black Panthers? I'd also recommend that for anyone who would like a look at their movement explained in their own words. She shot footage of them in 1968 Oakland at a rally for the release of Huey P. Newton. Thank you so much for sharing!  I just finished the PBS documentary and learned so much, and have several things I can’t wait to dig into more. Great watch Thank you for sharing these links ✊🏽 Thirty pieces of silver is roughly equivalent to $200 dollars today. Bill received two $100 bills and a set a silver keys. Great detail. What’s that referencing? I think Mitchell’s character gets somewhat overshadowed by the more overt “villainy” we see from Hoover or the Chicago PD. There’s that really uncomfortable scene where Hoover asks Mitchell what he’d do if his daughter brought home a black man - and I got the sense that Mitchell fundamentally didn’t view the world in that way before being asked that. He seemed like a strict “law and order” type who didn’t see the Panthers from the race war perspective that Hoover was coming from. We get a lot of hints in the FBI scenes that Mitchell knows what they’re doing is wrong, but that person is gone whenever we see him tasking Bill with his next step (there seem to be a lot of parallels between the Hoover/Mitchell relationship and the Mitchell/Bill one). 

And yet all of that doesn’t matter, because the end result is the same whether or not Mitchell was as much of an overt racist as Hoover was - innocent people are dead. White supremacy survives and thrives not because of the Hoovers of the world, but because of the Mitchells - the people who put career advancement, law and order, whatever over right and wrong. Bill and Fred's Not-So-Excellent Adventure I couldn’t help but love the cigar choice with Plemons’ character. Every time you see him, he’s either smoking or chomping on a cigar. No matter what he says about his intentions, or what he thinks he’s doing, the fact that the cigar is always there is a creepy fucking affectation. Like, this is just business, we’re playing little games here. Plemmons has been crushing it recently. I really thought they were gonna portray him as a sort of sympathetic villain when they showed him questioning the FBI’s decision to let that innocent panther be killed to shield their informant, and I sort of groaned for a minute that they were gonna try to whitewash how absolutely fucked up guys like Mitchell were. I’m really glad that they instead had it as a sort of passing pang of guilt and had him sort of double down towards the end. Like clearly he has *some* kind of morals, but they’re still mind of fucked up. This was scene was amazing. > Ms. Winters is grieving over her son and says something along the lines of “Yeah he did that...but that shouldn’t be his legacy.” I took that as to how the Black Panthers are still viewed today. Yeah they were militant, and they took extreme measures in practicing their second amendment rights; but they did so protecting their neighborhoods from a tyrannical unjust system, the amount of good they did for the people in their neighborhoods shouldn’t be overlooked, from the money they put into it and the clinics they’ve built.

PREACH. Thank you for this comment. I was a little discouraged when I opened this thread and people seemed to only care about the film making and seemingly werent interested in the subject matter. 

>Yeah they were militant, and they took extreme measures in practicing their second amendment rights;

This is one of things I wanted to delve into. I think the ""War and Politcs"" scene early on did an excellent job of framing the proper context. Too often in history we are taught about the reaction but ignore the initial action.  In this context the action is these black neighborhoods were being occupied by a hostile force(cops). The cops are already taking extreme action, but its never framed that way. When people react extremely to the cops actions, we label the reaction extreme but give the police a pass. Its similar to the George Floyd protest this summer where conservative outlets and reactionaries focused on the reactions to the killing  and kept the discussion on the rioters and not what they were rioting about. 

Coming into this movie I was already sympathetic toward Hampton, so that didnt change. What did change was noticing the parallels with our occupation of the middle east. We go  into foreign countries and intentionally destabilize the region in order for us to remain in power. The people in these countries can clearly see that our occupation isnt helping anything and we end up creating a breeding ground for ""extremism"". I used quotes because I think its important to consider who is doing the labeling. 

During one of the Hoover speeches in the movie I was thinking to myself ""I can see why law enforcement would be afraid of movement s like the black panthers "", It totally makes sense from their point of view. At the same time I can totally see why people like the Panthers would feel the way they did about law enforcement because of the way law enforcement dealt with their communities. 

Just remember ""politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed"" the next time you see people waiving their blue lives matter or thin blue line flags"" Think about the political message they are sending. Think about how blue lives matter is said in a direct response to black lives matter.  Then ask yourself if these people are really oblivious to the idea that they are drawing a line in the sand between cops and black people. This and the scene in the Young Patriots’ headquarters where he broke down why these people, so different, were so similar and needed to work together really showed not only Kaluuya’s greatness, but also Fred’s. This movie should go down as a classic right now Not gonna lie, seeing him bring Chairman Fred to life in that speech made me tear up alongside Deborah. Fun fact - Jaden Smith was in talks at one point to possibly portray him in a movie. I'm glad that never happened lmao Probably my favorite part of the film. I could’ve just watched a movie that loosely put together various speeches and be content. Haven't gotten chills watching a movie scene in a while, and damn that did it for me. Incredible job by everyone involved. Kaluuya is fucking phenomenal. This is likely my favorite scene in film this year ...absolute stunning That was an utterly mesmerizing scene. Kaluuya's dialogue delivery is just electrifying to listen to. Was Plemons actually there, or was Stanfield just having an image of Plemons being there?

Dude stuck out like a sore thumb. I understand there were white people in the movement, but I just think it would be stretch for that character to be there. was on the edge of my seat during that scene. It seemed as though it was framed in much of the same way that the Framing of the Constitution was painted. Same. Jail in those times was not like today. I just learned that the real Bill was only 17 when the FBI flipped him. Imagine facing 6 years in a place like that at 17 and then being used by the FBI like that. This has to be one of the most shocking things I’ve seen on film in a while. It stops you dead in your tracks. Everything about the image is grim and the fact that this film is based in reality, really makes your stomach drop. I didn’t understand that scene can someone plz educate me ty It took me a good minute to actually leave my seat. I went to the theater and picked a random movie just to have a Saturday night out, little did I know I'd learn and experience such an important part (to me) of history. Definitely reading more into this. 

I didn't even know it was a true story either until the ending. I was hoping for some revenge plot towards the end, but my heart was just torn in a matter of seconds. There was a REASON he was the target of governmental assassination. The man was a child and yet was creating a legitimate revolution that was prepped to change the world. He. Had. Power You never really got an idea of what the group did besides host breakfasts. I wanted to see more of the rainbow coalition and why exactly the FBI feared him so much. I liked the movie, but I thought the angle was not successful. Spent way too much time on the O'Neal character and he was still pretty two dimensional at the end of the movie. He turned FBI informant because he didn't want to go to prison or be found out to be a rat. How many times have we seen that?  


Would've much preferred to have seen more about Fred Hampton, honestly, and watch more of Daniel Kaluuya's performance. Shared this sentiment. I wish it had been a mini series bc the story and performances were captivating but I felt like it breezed by. A show would have provided so much more depth! thank you for the recommendation and your support on the creation of this film!! the movie and what it portrays is incredibly important today in our country. I love how much of its message wasn't held back and tries to show the honest truth, encouraging people to stay informed of our cruel injustices. PTTP Hey Sev, congrats on the success of this movie. Been really cool to track your career the last few years. Looking forward to whatever your next project is and wishing continued good luck to you! Hey Sev, it’s so cool to see you pop on here a lot. Just wanted to say how awesome it has been to watch  your career grow so much since Searching! Thats crazy.  It reminds me of Jordan Peele going from MadTV and Key and Peele to Get Out/Oscars yea, they birthed this project and brought it to Shaka King Worked with Sean to make those shots happen. Glad you liked them Also great performance by Dominique Fishback who played Hampton's girlfriend Great use of one shots and long takes in this movie, the firefight was gripping. I’ve always been a sucker for cinematography that involves cars from the 60s and 70s.


Got Dead Presidents vibes from this cinematography. So we was poisoned? The ages are an important context. I had no knowledge of the historical events and didn't realize how young they were supposed to be while watching the movie. O'neil being 17 does paint his decision making more sympathetically, at least a little bit. Deborah Johnson was the name of the character. The actress's name is Dominique Fishback. The scene before Hampton's death did some REALLY clever allusions and visuals suggesting the Last Supper. What does the Judas part refer to? Sorry if thats a dumb question Lil Rel Howery’s cameo was hilarious but kinda dark too. I wonder if his character was based on a real guy, I couldn’t find anything about it. Don't forget Jesse Plemons! Stanfield looked a lot like his Get Out character in that one scene where he wears a large hat. Why? Thanks. Shit mods here. Yeah I thought it was super weird that this movie of all movies, either didn't have a discussion thread like every new movie has or wasn't that easy to find. (Coincidence, I think not gif*) I'm sorry for your loss. May your mom rest in peace and in power. I understand why the politics of making O'Neal the main character aren't ideal, but I think it was necessary. Putting him at the center of the frame allows the movie to dive more into the unethical practices and policies of the FBI. I think it's tougher to show just how truly fucked up the situation was without that piece of the puzzle. > COINTELPRO didn't die with Hoover, these are systemic tactics that the State utilizes to this day.

Not just 'the State' - but all sorts of bad actors, especially on online communities like, oh, reddit.... Wow, thank you for this info! I loved the film but can see why framing it through O’Neal wasn’t ideal. I’m so glad to hear Fred Hampton Jr. was involved and helped shape it. Also, thanks for the recommendations! Are there any books you recommend about Fred Hampton, or even the Black Panther Party in general? (I know there are lots out there but would love to hear what you particularly think is good!) [deleted] I’m really interested in the politics of Chairman Fred  Sr. Namely that he put the class struggle above all else and was a committed anti-capitalist. The movie didn’t shy away from being aggressively anti-government and also showed how he built the rainbow coalition. He explicitly mentions the universal struggle for freedom of all oppressed people in a way that would have no doubt pissed off a lot of black nationalist Panthers. 

With that said, it’s my understanding that Chairman Fred Jr. did do a lot to add his fathers true ideas to the film. However I have a bone to pick with him. His dad was someone who saw through the veneer of racism and understood it was a tool used to sow dissent among the underclass. But Chairman Fred Jr. was jailed for firebombing a Korean grocery after the LA riots. I agree that the tension was high and there was blood on the Korean community’s hands, but a Marxist wouldn’t have attacked a poor to middle class grocery store owner. They would have attacked the system that let off Soon Ja Du in the first place. That’s the real enemy. 

It’s likely Chairman Fred Jr. changed in prison. But I can’t help but feel that he’s most definitely not his father and that him firebombing a Korean small business is a great metaphor for how disorganized and separated the class struggle is now. I can’t help but think of the weaknesses of the BLM movement where they’re a leaderless hydra with no direction and thus very little political power. I see it as a massive success by the government at killing off the firebrand figureheads of youth led movements and instead supplanting it with Twitter followers and the occasional riot where not much happens after. The system can handle a riot. It can’t handle genuine political change. I’m just so glad they didn’t water down Hampton or the Panthers’ message. They literally had him name dropping Marx and other leftist thinkers while dedicating a seen to him explaining the flaws of gradualism. I’m so fucking happy an unapologetically leftist film exists in the mainstream. I’m glad this film exists. Why would you be taught that the government and cops are the ones committing the crimes? Even of what you know of MLK is watered down. They distort history to fit a narrative The white system purposely props up ""the good ones"" to brainwash you into thinking that there's a ""right"" way to protest and stand up for your people. I teach at a rural, entirely white high school and I have the kids read Malcolm X after reading MLK. I bet 80 percent have no idea who he is before that. Even the way our textbook frames the ideological differences between them is pretty disheartening. It’s a good thing I have the freedom to add in other sources as I see fit. Now go watch The Weather Underground watched it in Dolby, streaming never comes close to the movie theater experience. It's the most popular film to see in my area but that's not saying much considering how few films are being released theatrically. This movie was unforgettable and I have already ordered follow-up reading material on the movement and the party. I hope great word of mouth keeps attendance up! I thinks he’s got it in the bag this year! This movie deserves to win Oscars And O'Neal was 17 years old when he did all this. That's one thing that's definitely watered down by this movie. Kaluuya and Stanfield looked like grown men, obscuring the fact that these were just kids that the US government used and brutalized. >When they put up the text at the end saying Chairman Fred was only 21 years old.

The crazy thing is (which unfortunately wasn't included in the movie) he was already organizing hundreds of people as a young teenager through the Junior NAACP before joining the Black Panther Party. **The FBI had him on their radar and wiretapped his phone at age 14...** it didnt help that Kaluuya had big dad bod energy in this one lol, im sure it was accurate to the real Fred Hampton, but its till kinda jarring if hes supposed to be 21 When they roll the clip of Hampton at the end I was so blown away by how spot on his accent was. Tiny part, but Martin Sheen *nailed* being the anti-President Bartlett in this one. He undoubtedly took pleasure in presenting someone he hated as a total monster. It makes sick sense that he was killed at that age now. 18 or 19 would be too young to kill. They literally waited until he was old enough to be viewed as a legit adult Jesse Plemons is a masterful villain. You can tell he really internalizes their motivations and doesn't judge them, which is one of the most difficult challenges for an actor playing someone whom they might personally find despicable. In this, Breaking Bad, and Black Mirror, you weirdly find yourself feeling some sort of understanding/empathy for him before pulling back and realizing how horrific his actions are, and that's down to the complexity of his performances. He's sold me on watching anything he does in the future. I may suggest the following interpretation. Early in the film we see Bill during the meetings with Mitchell where he's all dressed up like a pimp. The guy basically wanted to live a high life - cars, fancy clothes, etc. He is around 20 year old, got no political principles whatsoever. Just a small time crook. Remember when during the earliest Panthers meeting he tries to approach a girl? 

Li Rey Howery's character is introduced to show the depth and complexity of FBI's informants in black community and also to provide Bill with the sleeping drug. Mitchell won't do such a dirty work himself.

But Li Rey Howery's character can also be interpreted as a projection of Bill. The older version of Bill. The guy in a posh fur coat, sitting in a bar, trying to get himself a woman for the night. That's why he gives Bill his own fake badge. And that's why this scene is a bit surreal. Lmao idk why but that scene spooked tf out of me I liked the moment, but it was too unrealistic to me that events would occur like that and it took me out of the film. That's one of my few complaints. I felt like he rose to quickly in the ranks. I understand they didn't want to make the film 3 hours, but there could have been a little more time between the 2 characters. I agree entirely. It was simultaneously an amazing film and a godawful film. The acting and cinematography were amazing, but the writing and directing were atrocious and amateur. The movie never had footing or flow for a second. Scenes just happened with no impact and you could tell the directing was to overact as Oscar bait in so many scenes that it loses the viewer — people are suddenly giving monologues out of nowhere for no real established reasons at all quite frequently. The movie also has this insane smarminess that it gives off due to King very clearly being so in love with their own writing that they just never elevate it for a visual medium. So so many scenes are just characters speaking dialogue for far too long and it causes for the mantra of show not tell to fail entirely. I honestly wish I had just watched a documentary instead. This parallel is making me so emotional and I’m not even religious. I was reading on wiki after that Hoover was mad because the undercover investigation of the San Francisco Panther chapter revealed the vast majority of their efforts went into feeding kids. I’m glad they brought up the free breakfast at least Those things don't make for good conflict so its harder to put them as full scenes. What are you talking about all of those things were in the movie? They show Fred Hampton teaching at after-school programs, their food programs were heavily shown, there's literally a scene of Hampton handing out pamphlets to people. Were you not watching the movie? Definitely agree; these actors were great but they acted and felt like grown men, not a teenager and a young man killed in his prime Yo wtf Reading that last sentence has made me insanely happy. He's worth the deep dive. The orphanage bully in Like Mike The guy who played Voodoo seems to be doing pretty well too. Your right. This movie, Get Out, Queen and Slim, Black Panther, probably some more... Fred Hampton looked and acted way older than 21 as well in my opinion so I didn't mind the casting. I thought Kaluuya's acting was brilliant. Not just the cops, the US government too. Even after all these years they're still doing exactly the same thing. Fuck the USA. One thing that I liked and wish there was more of in the movie was the rainbow coalition. Fred Hampton convinced the young lords and young patriots that they all faced the same issue and would need to join together to fight it. It’s something that I think is lot in the current climate. lol I've been quoting this all day. [Eyes on the Prize II is available on Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/product/eyes-prize), which requires a library card or university login. O'Neal is featured in the episode ""A Nation of Law"", although keep in mind they use clips of him sparsely (the full interview transcript [can be found here](http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=one5427.1047.125)) This is it.

I am willing to bet I could find them all with just a little more googling or binging. Here ya go: [https://youtu.be/f0xjBcih9a8](https://youtu.be/f0xjBcih9a8) I also would like to know this. All I could think of was him with his dog in Game Night Definitely with 3 acting nonsense possible. always irks me when him and his performances get minimized to a joke about his weight gain on El Camino by the BrBa community 😬 dude's phenomenal in these roles. > The FBI was cynically manipulating a kid. The scenes where he's in fancy restaurants enjoying food he'd probably never eaten before and cigars and scotch and looking at the FBI agents nice house along with his naiveté and gullability and sympathy with the Panthers take on a whole new meaning.

When Bill is in Roy's house and Roy says, paraphrasing;

> I better go put those dogs on. If you want the good stuff, it's in the bottom cabinet. Scotch. Make yourself at home.

The scene takes on almost a completely different meaning when you know he's young. I watched it last night and just have been going back and forth all day about it in my mind. The entire movie would have such a completely different vibe if they went younger, but I don't think it would have been anywhere as good. Lakeith and Daniel gave such amazing performances and they made the film what it was. I loved any of that rough jazz > All these black leaders could have been active for all of the modern era

And it's important to stress that they are not because of COINTELPRO. I recommend you read [the goals of COINTELPRO](https://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/COINTELPRO/COINTELPRO-FBI.docs.html) and especially take note of the final goal ""to prevent the long-range growth of militant black organizations, especially among youth. Specific tactics to prevent these groups from converting young people must be developed."" Dominique Fishback was one of the highlights of the movie. Especially during the second half. Well yeah but then the FBI wouldn't have done their jobs well. I think the effect you were seeing was the type of camera they used when filming, which was an Arri Alexas with a DNA lense. It sort of emulates film , that way it gives the cinematography a respected period look. IMO, I thought it was well done.

Overall though, man what a movie. This is the type of film I love to see. It felt very refreshing to come to a theater and leave like you truly experienced and learned something. Especially after all my years of showing up for Marvel I love his episode of ""Shrill"". Haven't seen ""People of Earth"" or ""Newlyweeds"" yet but maybe I should. The classroom scene is probably the last time it fully references communist ideology and its towards the start. my sentiments exactly. this fucking sucks. I agree on the length felt this movie was meant to be 2.5 hours long Yeah I think the plot and performances are amazing.

My one gripe is I don't think the film depicts O'Neal's motivations or lack of motivations very well. Like, if he really does believe he's doing the right thing, or if he's only in it for himself, OR if he is conflicted, then show that and the reasons behind it. But I don't think the film showed us any of it.

O'Neal was kinda going along with what the FBI was telling him to do, then he felt bad about it for whatever reason, then came back around and listened to the FBI again, and was sad about it for whatever reason.

Did he gradually begin to support the Panthers? Did he realize money comes first? He doesn't wanna murder Hampton, sure, but... why? [deleted] The actor in The Trial of the Chicago Seven was closer in age to the real Fred Hampton That's a good point to make though it's probably a lot harder to find younger actors that can pull off roles like these. I've been a huge fan ever since he put a glass shard to his throat in Black Mirror. 15 Million Merits has stayed one of my all-time favorite episodes, and a large part of that has to do with his performance. Yup, when he did his speech, I was amazed. I think Lakeith did a great job as Bill and killed the role, after seeing the movie I can’t imagine anybody else in the role...that being said he didn’t look 17 which was how old Bill was when he got approached by the FBI. I think if it was somebody that looked younger it might have been easy to have a little more sympathy.


And idk, maybe it was because I’ve seen him in a lot of young adult roles so it was hard to place him as a teenager. In comparison the guy that played Jimmy Palmer(Ashton Sanders) still looks young to me because I’ve only ever seen him as a teenager in the movie Moonlight. There's some people unhappy that it's not more focused on the Panthers but this movie doesn't get made without that framing. 

As a huge fan of Hampton, I'm happy with this film Well Sorkin also kind of made up a lot of shit, especially that end scene which detracts from damn near everything about what made that trial so jarring and significant. The recent MLK/FBI docume try as well about the FBI going after MLK. Black struggle cinematic universe confirmed? /s It's MUCH better than Chicago 7 though. > didn't really feel any sympathy for Bill's plight, I don't feel there was any real moment where he starts to question what he's doing. I thought maybe the blowing up the building thing was all him, but then you see he had a wire so it was just more scheming.

To be fair I think in real life Bill didn't really have a huge relationship with Fred and wasn't really all that shaken up about turning him in. In fairness to Bill I think he was a teenager at the time, so the idea of this movement being more important than his record would have been lost on him If you've never seen them in anything else before, both are in Get Out. Stanfield is also in Sorry to Bother You, which is an absurdist comedy about black people in the corporate world. Definitely recommend if you're looking for some other good performances if theirs. And the dude is incredible in Atlanta tv show as well! It's not a biopic of Fred Hampton and his rise through the NAACP into the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers. It's a biopic of someone who Hampton trusted who infiltrated his network but who never wanted to see him killed. If a group of people killed my dad in cold blood and got away with it....if a group killed most peoples dad in cold blood and got away with it most people would spend their lives wrecking havoc too This thread is under surveillance by HUAC to track leftist sympathisers. Considering Fred's life was dedicated to political revolution, it feels weird to say the film had to much politic.  Especially when the narrative only exists because of politic in the first place. Its similar to how Amadeus is mostly a Salieri biopic or Assassination of Jesse James is a Bob Ford biopic. I mean Judas gets top billing so from jump you know it's not about Hampton. Careful, people use that oversimplified narrative to water down Chairman Fred like they have with Dr. King. You left out the fact that he was a socialist who organized with Black and Latino gangs, encouraged armed self-defense, advocated anti-imperalism, and was already targeted by the FBI before the creation of the Rainbow Coalition. Your statement ""the State wasn't scared of Black Power"" is also not true, as evidenced by COINTELPRO documents. everyone should look up cointelpro, and operation chaos... This is a really great point. Sometimes biopics have to manufacture conflict to make it compelling or else it would feel fake, but some people just live excellent lives. RIP Fred. I don't know if it was her or the director, but I absolutely loved the choice not to outwardly react at all to Fred getting shot. She could easily have broken down, but it was so much more powerful to watch her stillness taking in what really she probably knew was the inevitable conclusion of their situation. And shows the emotional numbing that happens when people have become accustomed to the police murdering their loved ones. She’s also good in *The Deuce*. Her best scene for me was when Fred Hampton was making his speech at the church after he returned from prison, and she’s slowly starting to realize that Hampton is set to become a martyr for what he’s fighting for, as she claps for him while also wiping away her tears. Just brilliant stuff from her. She was in The Deuce on HBO and I thought was very good in it. Great show imo and made by the same creator of The Wire. If you haven't seen Short Term 12 you've got to. Also he has insane comedy chops in Atlanta and Sorry To Bother You. I paused it, it's actually 2 $1000 dollar bills which were still in circulation at the time. Judas was given 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. Well put. Thats what was so heart breaking in that moment. You get almost this false sense of hope because they spend time establishing that Mitchell is in fact not a racist, only for him to buy in at the end and perpetuate the system,  crushing any hope that something positive would come for the characters. 

Also side note my wife is pregnant and we decided to name him CJ so when I saw your username I told her our son messaged me on reddit and we had a good laugh. I saw Mitchell as the perfect embodiment of MLK's ""White Moderate,"" someone who is comfortable with thebstatus quo, someone who might not harbor as explicitly racist thoughts, someone who values peace more than justice.

The movie goes out of the way to show how much he benefits from the system in place. It just goes to show that complying with evil makes you the bad guy too. ""First, I must confess that over the last few years 
I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great 
stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate 
who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace 
which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods 
of direct action""; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of 
time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of 
good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more 
bewildering than outright rejection."" - Martin Luther King Jr., **Letter from Birmingham Jail** Just to add in...he definitely knew it was wrong when he brought his superior “the story of what happened to Alex” & then we find out that the dude who killed him is an ACTUAL fbi informant. But nonetheless he continues on his pursuit knowing that what they’re doing isn’t ‘heroic’ or how the good guys would do it Hey man, fuck you for making me laugh, this ain't funny It's the first movie I've ever seen that paints cops and feds as unambiguously racist and evil.  The agents are semi-stylized caricatures, the psychopathic kid from Breaking Bad as the passive but morally devoid one, the more senior two are oily alcoholics who put their psychosexual pathologies related to race right on the table (""you wouldn't want one dating your daughter, now would you?"").  Long overdue, imo. When he takes that long pull from his cigar after being asked if Fred is going to be killed, while giving Bill that dead, unblinking stare, that was absolutely terrifying. He became a much more malevolent presence in the movie during his final two conversations with Bill. Stanfield too! They're both on serious runs. Yeah he has lol > Just remember ""politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed""

Just a heads up for people reading, this is a fundamental tenet of Maoism.

The movie did a decent job of not whitewashing Fred's politics (could've been better, could've been *much* worse), and I was glad to see them use the word *socialism*, the phrase *international proletariat revolution*, and talking about Maoism out in the open. It's just so terrible what this country did to him. One of those things that keeps you up at night. That whole dialog, paraphrasing;


Panther: *Your people enslaved us*


Young Patriot: *Our ancestors were too poor to even own slaves*


Panther: *So the overseers, just as bad*



**Hampton**: *Now imagine if the overseers and slaves got together to slit masters throat and spread his wealth to their people*


Panthers and Young Patriots: *This mf spittin* While it would have been a much worse performance, it would have helped portray better how young Hampton really was. Glad to read this cuz I just saw the movie in the theaters and this scene made me tear up too I almost got emotional myself, that scene was so powerful Jaden might have been able to try Bill if they went with more age accurate actors. Bill in this movie was 17-20, for those who didn’t know. I believe he was there, because later in one of the dinner scenes he mentions to O'Neil how seeing him there made him think he believed in what Hampton was saying. Also Hampton during that same speech said how the pigs may very well be in that same crowd so I'm assuming they all had some idea about bad actors being there but weren't going to start singling people out. Also 6 years turns in much longer if guards or other prisoners don’t like you It’s still pretty bad buddy. If you google the definition of rabble rouser that might help but basically the guards carved it into him presumably bc he was “causing trouble” by educating other prisoners about racism, their rights etc and maybe persuading them to stand up for themselves. Similarly to Fred and the panthers, hence why Fred nods at him. The People had and continue to have the power. He knew how to direct it. Well they were hosting educational classes and putting together a clinic and all. The community coming back together to rebuild the burned down headquarters also made it feel pretty powerful. The FBI was terrified that the Black Panther Party would end up leading a literal Communist Revolution in the United States. This was a time when Communist Revolutions were happening in countries all over the world. Less than a decade before the movie is set, Cuba had a Communist Revolution, and China had one just twenty years prior. 

Approximately 1/3 of the entire world had a Revolutionary Socialist/Communist Government at the height of the Cold War, and the FBI believed the Black Panthers stood a realistic chance of succeeding if they weren't destroyed. Anti-Communism and racism/white supremacy go hand-in-hand. There's a reason racists went around marching with [""Race Mixing is Communism"" signs](https://peoplesworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pjimage-1-2.jpg). Dude's been producing since Fruitvale Station. He's been on the rise for a while. Amazing job guys. Cinematography was fantastic, the continuous shots and the use of light and shadows was just masterful. There was one in an apartment in darkness with two windows lighting the scene, one blue and one red - one of my favorites. I loved the ones near the end of Winters and the cops moving through the oil refinery near the end too. It was a big effort to overhead shot for the shoot out. Happy it was noticed. He was drugged. Correct. There's a lot of fair assessments we can make of O'Neal's character to go through with it, even as a 17-year-old, but he was a puppet for law enforcement to imprison and assassinate a black men. They took advantage of his desperation to avoid a sentence in an all-time gruesome way. Bill as the Judas, betraying Fred as the Messiah. Judas is famous as being the man who sold out Jesus Christ and beterayed his trust. Will Oneal also beterayed Hampton's trust and sold him out. Hampton is a powerful figure head of the black panther party seen as a messiah for that chapters movement. So it's just to call Bill Judas and Fred as the Black Messiah I feel like this movie tried to make a point on how big of an operation cointelpro was by showing how many informants were throughout the country, and Lil Rel’s character was another example of that Yeah he played that small role very well . Yeah my original comment was just about how this movie was a little Get Out reunion. But yeah Jesse Plemons was incredible as well No joke, out of all the Breaking Bad cast, he seems to pop up in the best things of any of them. Because for new movies they only want discussion in the 'official discussion' threads, and because damn near every subreddit is over moderated. Thank you dearly

Amazing, phenomenal username you got there pal... Yeah I liked that they basically made it a crime drama from O'neals perspective. Seeing the motivations and conflict in O'neal made it a better movie and they needed his perspective to integrate the FBI part of the movie Saw a comment from King saying something to the effect of ‘I had to try and shoehorn a Fred Hampton biopic into an espionage thriller to get this made’. I think making it from O’Neal’s perspective did really well to try and drive home one of Hampton’s earlier messages in the movie, of how capitalism is built by the oppressors taking advantage of the oppressed with scarcities the system created to get them to turn on one another. Heck, I feel like you even notice it a bit in Mitchell’s talk with his boss (although his grievance of “I don’t want my daughter dating a black man” is bullshit). I could be reading into it a bit too much though. Seeing the fake flyers created by the FBI that were distributed to sow dissent between the Panthers and the ""Crowns""... *really* reminded me of shit I see on Facebook (and another social site that supports the free exchange of ""VALuAbLe COnverSatiON""). It’s was like 6-7 years ago, they literally had an operation call /pol/intelpro. I saw it live, probably one of the largest sock puppeting  operations ever. Recommending books is tough since there's a lot of misinformation out there, as the FBI was behind 73% of the articles on the Black Panther Party. Because of this, I'd recommend first-hand accounts like Safiya Bukhari's *The War Before*, Assata Shakur's *Assata*, Huey P. Newton's *Revolutionary Suicide*, etc.

When it comes to Chairman Fred Sr. in particular, Chairman Fred Jr. and Mama Akua are the best sources, which is why I recommended the podcast in my initial comment. [Listen to Director Shaka King talk about Chairman Fred Jr. correcting the information they got from reading books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1395&v=NaQguNyU5Xo) The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther, by Jeffrey Haas, is a great one. Jeffrey Haas is one of the attorneys that represented the plaintiffs during the trial mentioned at the end of the movie. It goes real deep into the conspiracy between the FBI and local police to cover-up the killing, as well as how difficult they had to work to receive a fair trial. [Black Against Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15722514-black-against-empire) is one of the best. It's like the line in Mank "" You cannot capture a man's life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave an impression of one"". I'm glad you brought that up, because Chairman Fred Jr. has himself been targeted by the government. In that case he was innocent and given trumped up charges, much like they put his father in prison for the ice cream truck robbery (which he had no involvement in). Remember that one aspect of COINTELPRO is to discredit, and the media plays a large role in that (so be skeptical of the articles you read on Wikipedia or anywhere else). It was stated by the FBI itself ""it is immaterial that the facts exist to substantiate the charge"" >But I can’t help but feel that he’s most definitely not his father and that him firebombing a Korean small business is a great metaphor for how disorganized and separated the class struggle is now. I can’t help but think of the weaknesses of the BLM movement where they’re a leaderless hydra with no direction and thus very little political power.

That happened in 1993, it was closer to the time of Chairman Fred Sr. than present day.

As for BLM, I would say they have been very successful at bringing about cultural change. The extent of their political victories has yet to be seen, due in large part to the deadlock in Washington that goes back to much large and entrenched mechanisms. > But Chairman Fred Jr. was jailed for firebombing a Korean grocery after the LA riots.


This was well known to citizens of South Central that he didn’t do this, LAPD played the role of Hoover and assumed Fred Jr was some “mastermind of anarchy” like his father, and they pounced at the opportunity to bring him in on bogus charges since they also assumed he was the mastermind behind the 92 riots. The L.A. Riots were almost 30 years ago, do you have any examples of his behavior and opinions more recently? He’s so whitewashed, it’s disgusting. I also conveniently never learned about how over half the country had negative opinions of mlk when he died. 

It’s what I always tell people who don’t support blm. “Do you like the ideas of mlk” 
“Yes”
“Well he was majority disliked when he died, you realize you would’ve been one of them?” All of history is a narrative. The people you include, the dates, the words you choose to describe events, it's all a narrative, no matter who writes it. That's what historiography is. Yeah I think if they were younger looking it would make O'Neal feel more like a victim himself as well

 But then again you arent gonna find too many teenagers or young looking actors who can perform like Stanfield and Kaluuya did. And ultimately I think that was a more important thing to nail yeah i feel that is the biggest flaw to the historic accuracy of the film. Reminds me of Detroit were the actors were all in their 20s but in real life they were like 15-16 year old. Damn. That takes me back to the store of the Central Park Five. If you think about it, the police took advantage over O’Neal in some of the same ways, if not most. Definitely changes the story a bit knowing how young they were Has the FBI ever commented on their surveillance of civil rights activists recently? Real scumbags Very nice! Changed the way I saw it, my TV quality is kinda shitty so I honestly didn’t even realize it was the fake badge from the beginning of the film. Same. That was some incredibly unnerving music. Mate, you’ve written exactly what went through my mind. Why not put this in the movie? Literally a 10 second scene Man I really feel like the shootouts with the police kept this movie from truly being great in my eyes. Fictionalized shootouts with police with fake characters where the panthers are the instigators seems like they are setting up justification for the police retaliation. It left a really bad taste in my mouth and I feel like they were extremely unnecessary for this story I think Panther(1995) nailed this aspect pretty well. The teaching scene came across like a strategy meeting cause the main actors are all so much older ? Couldn't even imagine the wisdom and knowledge he'd have today. He would be in his early 70s. > Voodoo 

Ah yeah from Leverage. Thank you a ton, seriously. This is it. Took me 20 minutes to hunt down, but I found it. Here is the episode on the Black Panthers.

I am willing to bet I could find them all with just a little more googling or binging. Me too! The music was one of my favorite parts about the movie. Totally agree... that poem. Oof. They mentioned starting ""an international proletariat revolution"" multiple times later on.

That's that good ole commie talk IMO I think part of the point is that he himself didn't *really* know how he felt about what he did what he did or how to talk about it. We see that in his interview footage at the end. He claimed he had no allegiance to the Panthers after Fred Hampton's death, but killed himself after the documentary with his interview was released. I think he probably had very complex feelings about it that weren't totally known even to himself, and that's what we get, just like when he's asked about MLK's death. You can see him wrestle with *something*, but unable to articulate it. That's who his character was, at least as portrayed in the film. We have to remember he was a kid at the time. When they showed the real Fred Hampton I still was shocked at how old he looked. The only younger actor I could think of who could maybe pull it off is in the movie too in Ashton Sanders, but I think he lacks the gravitas right now that Kaluuya possesses. And, he doesn't have the physical resemblance. Not saying that Kuluuya is a spitting image, just that he's much closer to looking like Hampton in his default look than Sanders imo.

Edit: Kelvin Harrison Jr too but we already saw him briefly as Fred Hampton so I don't think he pulls it off quite like Kaluuya even though I love Harrison as an actor. That episode is one of the most devastating things I've watched. [deleted] Dude I was trying to place one of the leaders for the LONGEST & it finally dawned on me that Terry (Khris Davis) from “Atlanta” was the leader of the Crowns “Steel” The original cut of the movie actually focused even less on Hampton and the Panthers and almost exclusively told the story from Bill O’Neil’s perspective. Shaka King drastically recut the movie after getting feedback at an early screening for Black directors. I mean the Korean's didn't kill his dad. I know the L.A riots were about race, but I don't think Hampton Jr.'s actions that day would be justifiable as venting frustration at a systemically racist justice system.

It's also worth noting that Hampton Jr. claims he was framed for the arson, but I'm not sitting on enough evidence to make a judgement call on that one. that's no excuse. I mean, the title “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” makes it pretty clear that Ford’ll be a major player. Right. The State was scared of every single one of those things. He just happened to be all of them. The point being made is that Hampton, unlike most other revolutionaries after the civil rights movement, made the focus on class instead of race. This uniquely separated him from black power/black nationalist movements before and during his time. 

Explicitly, this is seen not only in quotes that were in the movie such as, ""We're going to fight racism not with racism, but we're going to fight with solidarity. We say we're not going to fight capitalism with black capitalism, but we're going to fight it with socialism."" but the entire segment and real-life portion of the Rainbow Coalition that shows his interaction with working and poor white Southerners of the Young Patriots who even brandish Confederate flags and who sign on the Rainbow Coalition.

This ability to unite Chicago's proles and lumpen, which represents minute differences (moreso then than now) in material conditions along identity groups compared to the massive difference in the capital-owning & protecting classes to themselves, is what made Hampton especially threatening to the intelligence agencies and what created the ""Messiah"" image that they feared.

So yes, the primary aspect of Hampton that made him such a threat to the upper classes and their apparatus of force was his class-focused rhetoric and unification. The framing of that shot was actually a direct result of the real Deborah Johnson (now known as Akua Njeri) being adamant on set that she did not cry. Mgrierwas talking about kaluyaah Oh wow But the thing is, Mitchell IS a racist, he was the entire time. The facade just wasn’t clear until the end. 

It’s like how people think they can be “both sides” and not be racist. Saying things like “oh well I don’t like the white nationalists but I think BLM is too divisive”. 

I think his character does a great job of how people can be racist but not “putting on my hood saying the n word” obvious. Which is the most dominant form and the biggest problem in my book nowadays. White people who hold racist thoughts and ideas, but who think they aren’t contributing because they have a black friend, or they believe in some form of equality that doesn’t even challenging the status quo. 

You probably see that though, I hope I’m not just preaching at you mate. I thought it was also a good representation of “all cops are bad” when they continue to follow “procedure” and back each other up. I’d go further and say that maybe Mitchell starts out as the White Moderate, but he very quickly becomes an active participant in the perpetuation of Hoover’s explicit white supremacist agenda. Whether or not he held those views himself is irrelevant because the result is the same. He's no White Moderate. One question about his daughter, and he has no qualms going through with the plan. He's a fucking white supremacist pig, like all of them were “I’m all for equality, but no one should be able to cheat to get it” 🤯🤯🤯 a WASP telling a minority not to cheat...WOW funny enough, he is the only character who is eating/drinking during the film. I don't know if that speaks to the power he represents, being a ""pig"" or just greedy. but i noticed it damn it Full quote

“I must make two honest confessions  to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that  over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white  moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the  Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the  White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white  moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a  negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which  is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in  the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct  action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for  another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who  constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""  Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than  absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance  is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

I  had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order  exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in  this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the  flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would  understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of  the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro  passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive  peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human  personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not  the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden  tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can  be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as  it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural  medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the  tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the  air of national opinion before it can be cured.

In  your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must  be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical  assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his  possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this  like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and  his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided  populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like  condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing  devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must  come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it  is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic  constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence.  Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped  that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in  relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from  a white brother in Texas. He writes: ""All Christians know that the  colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible  that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity  almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of  Christ take time to come to earth."" Such an attitude stems from a tragic  misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there  is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all  ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either  destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of  ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of  good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the  hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling  silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of  inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to  be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes  an ally of the forces of social  stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time  is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of  democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative  psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from  the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.”

[https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles\_Gen/Letter\_Birmingham.html](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) You should check out Mangrove on Amazon Prime if you want another true story about systemic racism. The whole Small Axe series is worth a watch really but if you watch Mangrove and like it, you’ll probably like the rest. Curious, and truly am not asking a question as a set up to be clear, what did you think they did a bad job(or should have been better at to get a ""decent job"" rather than a good job) regarding Fred's politics? 

I know the story, but not a lot of the specifics and am truly looking to learn more. Grew up in my formative years(13ish through 22) in Mississippi, so obviously my education was biased towards one side and only the last few years(am 29 now) have I really strived to learn more of the true side of things, not what the state(Mississippi but also... the state) wanted us to know. I couldn't help but to think about what could have come of the ""rainbow coalition"" if it had been allowed to grow. Such a good scene!!!! he was 21. makes you question your life, this young brother was such a force at an age where most people are still dumb little shits After the movie I was shocked to see how young Bill & Fred were, I thought it was curious they didn't mention that in the film too. I questioned the casting choice until I looked at pic of Fred - he was a big guy and that made him look a little older and they made kaluuya look baby-faced enough.

They could have chosen someone younger to portray O’Neill, who was even younger than Hampton at the time. I wonder how conflicted he felt was about his actions, that clip at the end is chilling - recruited to be an fbi informant at 17-18 and deep undercover with the panthers for a couple years? Notice how he is also not allowed to eat while forced  to watch others eats. Pretty torturous. I thought he was the one that snitched Fred out for leaving that note I didn't know that, thank you. I like the scene where the crowns showed up to help. I just wish there was more like it. I want to see how the Young Patriots, Young Lords, and Black Panthers worked together Sean always has such a clear vision, you don't shoot much that doesn't get used. He always tries to light in a way that won't change the performance, which means using openings like windows a lot. Judas was also paid 30 silver, O'Neal was also paid for his work When Mitchell hands him keys to the gas station for a second it looked like silver pieces, which was incredible attention to detail by the director. Judas also killed himself Oh wow that's awesome. Title definitely seems like it fits Also, when they talked about the Panther/informant who was on the run and led them to various safe houses or headquarters so they could bust everyone else for ""harboring a fugitive""? It sounded just like the Judas Goats they use to hunt and cull herds in the Galápagos. What's crazy is O'Neal was not the only informant in the apartment that night. When Chairman Fred was assassinated, the state charged everyone in the apartment with numerous felonies so they had to fight those cases. Attorney Montgomery went to the judge and requested to know if there were any other agents or informants in the house that night besides O'Neal, saying it was essential to their defense to know this. The court dropped all the charges instead... In Adam Curtis' new documentary he talks about how Afeni Shakur, suspected a member of her Black Panther group was a cop. Turned out later there were three members working with law enforcement, and they didn't know about each other. Oh whoops, didn't notice.  My bad! [deleted] Also pretty crazy he is the most successful out of the Friday Night Lights cast.

I guess you could argue for Michael B Jordan but he was only on for 1 season. Clearly you havent seen the Academy Award nominated Need for Speed (2014) with The Price Is Right's Aron Paul. Well I think that’s because he’s settled comfortably into the character actor niche at this point. Since he wasn’t the star of the show, there’s less “leading man” syndrome he’d struggle with like Paul n Cranston, so he can take bit parts in ensemble pieces like this and succeed. Or at least that’s how I see it I guess. It’s crazy that they don’t have those threads up the day the movie releases. If I just watched something I’m probably going to want to discuss it while my thoughts are still fresh. Yep, my biggest complain about Reddit by far. It's so over moderated! 90% of the threads I start are removed for some of the most obscure reasons ever. I don't think it helps each big group has like 20 mods who all want to feel like they're important. it really is by far the worst part of reddit. The endless dumb rules and over importance the mods have Thanks but I wish I could take credit for it! An old internet pal of mine came up with it They also didn’t make O’Neal out to be overly heroic, guy was just a fuck up trying to not die or end up in prison



Spineless sure, but realistic Yup the framing worked for what the film was trying to convey . dude had a moment of ""I try to think of of this as a job at my best, gtfo with your ideology "" Exactly. It literally ends with the fed telling him ‘you have a business now, you’re free.’ are we talking about reddit? because reddit is very much NOT a bastion of free conversation Thank you so much! I will look at all of this material. Yeah I am definitely trying to be aware of all the FBI/govt misinformation/propaganda put out there about the Black Panther Party, which is why I really appreciate your recommendations. thank you for the follow-up material 👍🏽 Yes, highly recommend this. Really focuses on the politics and organisation of the party as well as the history and biography. Amazing book do you remember the part in the movie where the main character says that thats a bad way to think about it Also...he didn’t do it.


LAPD swore he was the mastermind behind the riots, they had a little Hoover in them, and so they acted on it, threw him up on a bogus charge.


Also very interesting that the judge didn’t allow a chemist to testify that it would be basically be impossible to get blisters on your hand from the heat of a motolov cocktail without it exploding on you. But yet one of the prosecution’s strongest arguments was that Fred Jr had blisters on his hand. > you arent gonna find too many teenagers or young looking actors who can ~~perform~~ **get the attention of movie-goers and award voters** like Stanfield and Kaluuya did.

FTFY Yes they Investigated themselves and found they did nothing wrong There was that one line from Lakeith Stanfield's character:

""These people aren't terrorists, man. They're terrorizing *me*."" I was just emphasizing your very good point! The most insane fact about him is his age at death. Still doesn't make sense to me how you can be that eloquent and influential at 21. That poem scene was gorgeous and very inventive, and was heightened even more by being crosscut with the Jake Winters shootout. Thats not specificslly Marxist or communist.Even Qanon people want to  start a people's revolution,its a common sentiment across all activistspeak just like sayimg ""overthrow the oppressors"" or ""make the politicians and fatcats fear us"".

She probably wanted more specific and clear politics that make him very clearly anti-capitalist. Like the kind whre a regular American would watch and think Hampton sounds really radical and fringe. Stress does unkind things to the human body. Back then I feel like everyone chain smoked and drank at a young age so you were looking in your 30’s in your early 20’s lol Not a lot of media can achieve ""trapped in a room of screens and forced to watch your crush participate in barely-consensual porn because of your direct actions that were meant to improve her lot in life"" levels of devastation. A REVOLUTIONARY Holy shit that blew my mind, really because the whole time I was looking at the Crowns dude, it felt like it was some actor in their late  40s trying to play somebody in their early 30s. I think it was the heavy makeup. You're feeding into the same theme.  Police keep killing unarmed black people over and over again and getting away with it meaning the system is saying IT IS OK but if a black man commits a crime the statement is IT IS NOT OK? The title of this film is **Judas** and the Black Messiah,clearly its about the Judas as primary.

Its mostly the marketing and ads which habe ked people to believe its about Hampton as primary,similar to how the recent Fred Rogers movie wS promoted to make ot look like Rogers/Hanks is the primary but he's not the protagonist. I totally get what you're saying, I just think OP was making a different point. They made it sound like the Rainbow Coalition was the *only* thing that made Chairman Fred a threat, which is false. I'm saying it's important to paint the full picture. Again, OP said ""the State wasn't scared of black power"" but glossed over the FBI's own documents explicitly stating otherwise. Yes, class struggle was a major aspect that made Chairman Fred a target, but my point is we shouldn't erase all the other things he fought for too. > The point being made is that Hampton, **unlike most other revolutionaries** after the civil rights movement, made the focus on class instead of race. 

This not even true lmao. “I must make two honest confessions  to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that  over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white  moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the  Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the  White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white  moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a  negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which  is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in  the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct  action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for  another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who  constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""  Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than  absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance  is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

I  had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order  exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in  this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the  flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would  understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of  the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro  passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive  peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human  personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not  the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden  tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can  be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as  it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural  medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the  tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the  air of national opinion before it can be cured.

[https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles\_Gen/Letter\_Birmingham.html](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) Yeah, he's not the ""white moderate""; the white moderate agrees with the goal theoretically but generally takes a negative, passive stance (""I can't support you so long as you're so strident/violent/etc.). This guy was actively attacking the movement;  he's Adolf Eichmann. 

>Arendt's book introduced the expression and concept of the banality of evil. Her thesis is that Eichmann was actually not a fanatic or a sociopath, but instead an extremely average and mundane person who relied on clichéd defenses rather than thinking for himself, was motivated by professional promotion rather than ideology, and believed in success which he considered the chief standard of ""good society"". Banality, in this sense, does not mean that Eichmann's actions were in any way ordinary, or even that there is a potential Eichmann in all of us, but that his actions were motivated by a sort of complacency which was wholly unexceptional

Plemons' character may have started out with a pseudo-idealistic view but when push came to shove he just went along, like Eichmann did, even if he didn't believe it (originally Eichmann claimed to want to relocate Jews but then did his ""job"" killing them as ordered). It was just easier to do so. >he is the only character who is eating/drinking during the film

Not true.

I think it was the second or third meeting he had with O'Neal in the restaurant, where Bill is seen tucking in to a thick steak and clicking his fingers to get a waiter to attend him, like he belonged at the *table*.

Also you see various members of the Panthers eating/drinking at different points of the movie, especially in the *last supper* at the end of the film. There are many people out there who I'd cede the answer to this question to. I'm not any sort of authority.

That said, my general sentiment is that what they could have done *better* is make it explicitly clear that Hampton's politics and those of the BPP were explicitly rooted in socialism, Marxism, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, etc.

They used one of those words once. They definitely could have used more than one of those words more than once. Or did a better job making it clear that all of those words are explicitly linked to things such as the breakfast program and the other mutual aid projects they did a decent job talking about in the movie.

If I didn't know any of that stuff going into watching it, I would have thought breakfast program, etc was just general nice volunteer stuff they did, and not explicitly tied to socialist (read: anti-capitalist) politicking.

I also think they could've done a much better job setting up the Young Patriots and the Young Lords and what they were all about. One of the reasons I firmly believe Hoover is one of the greatest villains in American history. His work helped to destroy the lives of some incredible minds that had the power to actually engender change The thing is if you look up the footage, Hampton looks like a fully grown 35 year old man! Wise beyond his years in every possible way. You have no choice but to grow up quick when you're living in that shit. It is mentioned in the end text that Fred was 21 when he was assassinated. But yea the movie doesn't really give you a sense of how young they were. I was surprised by that, too. Like, wtf was I doing when I was 21? Surely not being watched by the state for bringing up relevant issues and asking for change. Maybe he snitched for food. I just saw this film last night and this scene really stuck with me but can’t find much discussion on it. 

He was most likely a rat looking for cheese. He was a “Rable Rouser” at some point, possibly speaking up about one injustice or another. And so the reformers marked him as a warning others, possibly tortured for info on the BPP. 

I believe the scene is ambiguous enough that you question if he ever “Rabbled” after all Another 30 minutes would've really helped, but maybe it wouldn't be as exciting? And they both suicided I thought that shot of the (silver) keys falling out of the envelope was really well done Nice catch. ""30 Pieces of Silver"" was actually one of the titles Shaka King considered for the movie at one point God damn that's a good pickup 🤯🤯🤯 He didn't wait for the gospels to release though. And the term ""Black Messiah"" was a real phrase used by the FBI to describe Hampton. Jesse was phenomenal in Fargo season 2, as well as Black Mirror and (especially) Game Night. He's also been in a shit ton of supporting roles in these ""true story"" films from major directors, like The Irishman, The Post, Vice, Bridge of Spies, etc. - reminds me of Jeremy Strong in that regard. He reminds me a lot of a young Philip Seymour Hoffman. I think he could have a similar legacy if he keeps choosing strong projects. The mods who makes these discussions thread have been lazy with new weekly post since the pandemic started. >I don't think it helps each big group has like 20 mods who all want to feel like they're important.

Overinflated sense of power. When he met Jesse Plemons in the restaurant, throwing the maître d his coat, arriving in the tan suit and sunglasses I was like fucking hell. 

It was slightly jarring because for all intents and purposes they didn't really illustrate his character has turn into that when he's not with the BPP he's like some super fly socialite, but that's when you really see how he kinda sold out. I think one thing they really missed the mark on until literally the end title screens was just how young O’Neil was at the time. I know a lot of people would chime in and say well he continued this shit for a good while, but I think there wasn’t enough emphasis and how very powerful people were able to pray on people’s natural instinct of self perseverance in indoctrinating very scared kids. And by all accounts 19 years old is a child in my mind. It doesn’t make him inexcusable in his actions, but I believe he was also a victim of a very fucked system in his own right Sounds about right haha sorry it’s just that when I searched the guys name on Twitter it’s full of people just wishing the worst on him in hell and his family. Fuck the guy for showing no remorse or accountability for his actions later in life, but in the context of the film LaKeith’s meant to be playing a 17-19 year old kid and I just don’t buy it You can kill the Revolutionary but you can’t kill the Revolution. ✊🏽 black men have been targeting elderly asians, robbing and killing them. is that not OK? The movie does pretty evenly split its screentime between O’Neal and Hampton. It’s “Judas and the Black Messiah” with both as primary mentions, and both get their own arcs and room to operate in this movie. I think O’Neal is the main character in a dyad that the movie fundamentally explores.

The only point of my comment is that Jesse James’ title does shoutout Robert Ford, as does this movie’s title with Bill O’Neal. I agree they were scared of radical black organizing as well. But I think the emphasis on Hampton's class focus, over his work for black power, is especially important and rare because it was not only rare for a time coming fresh out of the civil rights era, it has become even more rare today. The most prominent organizers, take BLM movements, don't interact or acknowledge poor whites really at all. Leadership really wouldn't visit a Southern workers union or Southern pride group of low-income workers to try to form a coalition. The goal is no longer the solidarity that Hampton so fiercely fought to achieve. I think it's crucial to remember that Hampton would not have supported a modern abandonment of class solidarity and that's why it so defines him as opposed to many other BPP and civil rights leaders. His story is almost a tragedy as what he created hasn't been possible at that scale anywhere else since. Are you in my law school class? Haha. We just read this letter as an example of great persuasive techniques. Gotcha. Thanks you for your answer! Can't say I disagree with your point. Fun fact, America is still doing this shit, the FBI still exists. This isn’t some past misstep interesting how hoover looked like guiliani in the film He really did look like a grown ass man Probably for the best not to shine a lantern on that since they both don't look 21 but do embody that youthful energy Ppl wanted to be adults more in that time period + smoking cigarettes. Look at your parents hs yearbooks they were fully grown working adults while kids the same age now are encouraged to hold on to their childhood as long as possible. Just my two cents While it would be cool I think it could have ruined the pacing of the movie. Its already 2 hours and adding too much time of them doing more good stuff for the community probably would have just slowed it down too much IMO I think they could've flushed out Fred and the Panthers work a little more by removing the two scenes with the younger panthers getting into shoot outs..they very much felt like asides. Saaame. I have definitely seen people banned for making similar comments so don’t be shocked if this thread gets you banned. And why is the entire system continously allowed cops to get off on all types of crimes and that system continues but you bring up one fucking incident to draw attention to and talk about how thats not ok.  To be honest it shows a bit of racism on your part. What the fuck are you talking about?

During the trial, fire officials testified that the bottles that held the gasoline never broke, and no fingerprints[ were found linking Hampton to the crime.[6] name one southern pride group of low income whites On the other hand, it's not like u/Pointlesswonder802 was suggesting that it' has only happened in the past and isn't still going on today, he/she/they were just making an observation. Ya I feel like Fred Hampton at 21 still looks older than Jaden Smith will at 35 lol I actually think that would increase the impact of what we’re seeing. We know they’re young, but to see people doing such impactful things and be targeted by the most some of the most powerful forces in the world at such a young age is really something. Bill was younger than that. He was 17 when he was recruited by the FBI. This is definitely a movie that trusts its audience to do more research this is a launching point for many, and so I didn't have an issue with its brevity. It is a movie at the end of the day not a documentary. True, but there’s a very American tendency to hand wave past atrocities and crimes as things of the past, or attribute them to a single bad apple - when in reality the FBI still exists and largely operates in the exact same capacity with even more tools at their disposal. That is a fair point. I watched the movie with that knowledge. 
Instead of being impressed by their actions, I was distracted by the guys being 10 years older than they were portraying. I saw 30 year olds; it lessened the impact. I don't disagree with you and you are completely right, and I'm not trying to argue, but that already went without saying. The poster wasn't handwaving any of the crimes as things from the past or attributing them to a single person. He said Hoover was  'one of the worst villains"" not ""THE worst villain"". I just think people should save these arguments for people who are actually ignorant and believe that kind of shit.

And I know it seems like I'm making a huge deal out of this or putting you down, I'm not trying to and that's not my intention. Look up pictures and videos of Fred Hampton, he legit looked like he coulda been 30 years old. ",1
