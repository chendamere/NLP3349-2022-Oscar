I'm a huge long-time fan, and it was really disappointing to be sitting there hating the movie so much.  Glad that I appear to be in the minority, but I was just bored the whole time.  I always like his style and the quirkyness, but there wasn't enough story there for me to hang on.",0

The quick cut from the dead, naked body in the novel's storyline to the same one on the bed seems to anchor the two scenes outside of reality.  I don't think the movie really makes a whole lot of sense had she not followed through with the abortion. I did not get the impression that her and Armie Hammer would have had a kid around the same timeline, and correct me if I'm wrong but the ""daughter"" is never brought up by anyone in the real world outside of that phone conversation.  We know that Susan hardly sleeps so I don't think we can take every event that occurs in her reality at face value.",0

21090,"I'm actually a big fan of Spike Lee's films but this one was a bit lukewarm for me. There's a lot of good ideas and things I like, but despite the brilliant concept, I just don't think Spike Lee's heart was really in this one. A lot of the way it was edited and filmed felt almost like he was playing up tropes that we associate with his films, like he was trying to tick all of the boxes. It is also a bit too long for its own good.

&#x200B;

It is still worth a watch, to be sure, especially for the incredible performances. Everybody knocked it out of the park, but Delroy Lindo did an exceptionally good job.

&#x200B;

All in all, it wasn't Spike Lee's best, and I for some reason I felt like he didn't do enough to explore the experiences of black soldiers and marines in Vietnam. Maybe more focus on making the flashback sequences more realistic and less cheesy and action-oriented would've helped with that. Still, the acting elevated the movie and basically saved it for me.",0

25250,"Basements are pretty well established in this movie and others as being the subconscious. This one makes special sense because Jessie being the character stuck in an illusion reaches a pivotal moment, overcomes a big obstacle and contributes to her ride back home, by pressing through the conscious to get to the basement and seeing the a bit of the truth (the janitor uniforms, the fraud paintings). Dan Harmon actually wrote a bit about how the 2nd and 3rd quarters of movies are basements/ subconscious, which aligns with the timing in the movie decently well.",0

1490,"The story was clearly inspired by John Wick.  The writer/director didn't just accidentally make a movie with the same basic plot of one of the biggest movies of the last decade. The smart move is he made it in an entirely different genre.  

The story is >!a mythical figure in an underground world that has left his past to live a simpler life.

72120,"""Nocturnal Animals"" is incredibly executed in bridging together the parallel storylines, a task that is especially impressive given the tonal/genre shifts from story to story, to how the separate plots are paced out individually, as well as intercut with each other.
The acting is exactly what you; complete believability that is immersive, in particular order the stand outs are Michael Shannon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Amy Adams. I reluctantly place Mrs. Adams on the end of my list, knowing full well that this may have more to do the with the restrictions put on her character Susan (from a writing stand point) whereas the other actors are given more scenes that have a lot more meat to chew on.
Micheal Shannon, will probably be a favorite to win best supporting actor and Gyllenhaal most certainly deserves a nomination for best male lead. Both of these actors, consistently give it their all in bringing a character to life and this film is exemplary of that. Shannon's dry delivery and no nonsense demeanor became a well placed reservoir of dark humor throughout the film. Gyllenhaal, smartly knew how to infuse his multiple characters with the vulnerable indignation (for one role) and a helpless anger (for that other) that lived in harmony, thanks in addition, to the deft story structure. I've only seen Aaron Taylor Johnson in Kick Ass, but if I had any doubts about this ability to be terrify and psychotic in a role, than I'm gladly eating my hat now.
The film was shot in 35mm and looked spectacular, with a very specific esthetic that was based in commercial photography (during the Amy Adams sequences) that sometimes made me feel like I was a vintage perfume ad from 90's (I mean that in the best way possible!). When the film switched over to the thriller storyline, Ford and crew (DP Seamus McGarvey lensed ""The Avengers"") were just as confident in capturing the impotent dread one may feel in desolate locations far removed from ""civil"" society. The editing as well was at times, deliberate (re: slow) and calculated, sparingly snapping to quick cutaway at a few keys moments for devastating effect. The clever use of continuity editing (a gesture begins in one shot and ends in the next shot) to help the transitions from the parallel storylines---and the repetition of some very basic blocking with different characters (as simple as that may sound) had an incredibly playful effect to me, especially when it turn that technique on its head to undermined the viewers expectation.
Since this is a film by Tom Ford; this short note wouldn't be complete without a few words on the makeup and wardrobe. The makeup/hair extensions used to make Adams and Gyllenhaal look 20 years younger (along with the help of some digital effects clean up) look flawless. The wardrobe choices for Adams gallery curator, stood out the most (some for their beauty, others for their gaudiness)--along with her work/social colleagues, but isn't that what you'd expect from high society art elitists?
Final analysis: For me, the film takes as it muse the heartbreak of loss and how that emotion can manifest in our lives or be repressed in some cases, and how making ""art"" out of that loss--can help both cases come to an undeniable understanding.
I'd recommend this film if you're a fan of the following films: ""Adaptation"" by Spike Jonze, ""Synecdoche, New York "" by Charlie Kaufman, ""Twenty Nine Palms"" by Bruno Dumont, ""Breakdown"" with Kurt Russell and anything with a splash of Hitchcock and a pinch of David Lynch and a dash of Wong Kar Wai.

25745,">She said she would try to get Abby to love Christmas, then she does nothing at all to make Christmas special.

I think the idea was that when Harper spontaneously invited Abby to visit her family over Christmas, she was happy and confident and in love, in a place where she felt comfortable and could be herself, and just said what she was feeling. She really wanted to do those things, and she momentarily forgot that her situation was different at home.

By the next day, reality had set in and she tried to dissuade Abby from coming, because I think she realised that her optimistic vision of getting Abby to love Christmas again with her family was not how it was going to go. It stopped being about what she wanted (to enjoy Christmas with her girlfriend), and just became a matter of surviving the situation. Then once they got there, she unconsciously regressed into unhealthy behaviours that she learned during childhood, repressing her true feelings at every turn, and lashing out when the guilt became too much. She overcompensated and distanced herself completely.

If she were thinking more rationally I think she could have found a way to keep her secret without being so neglectful, and they could have at least enjoyed Christmas events together as ""friends"", but she was making some very poor decisions due to fear.",0

53883,"It's crazy seeing how many people are saying, ""don't over think things,"" when that's a huge part of the movie. If you're black you overthink everything. I have to analyze everything I do from the way I wear my hair, what clothes I wear, who I date, where and when I drive, who I fuck, to how I express emotion much more than others, particularly in majority white spaces. Chris saying he gets nervous around too many white people is real life for a lot of us. Can you imagine having to be on edge like that every freaking day? At the doctor, in the office, at the store, and like in this movie, even in your relationships? He tried explaining the ""subtleties"" to his girlfriend and she couldn't see it. Later we learn why, but it's really introducing people to a language they don't understand. A lot of people don't see it because they don't live it and they've never been forced to. The invasion of personal space, the need to relate in a condescending way, the reassurance that they're cool because they experience black by proxy, the sexualization, this is shit that happens every freaking day and it's fucking exhausting. Sometimes you want to be around people who understand what that's  like. If that makes some white people uncomfortable to hear, imagine living it everyday.

29716,"This movie was incredible. I was really skeptical of seeing the movie for some reason. I think it was because I wasn't familiar with McKay and Chapman as leads and all the big names were cameo roles. But I was way wrong. The sequence with them going through No Man's Land. Holy shit. Running around in the village Ecoust, had to Wikipedia that, at night time? It was like walking around in a post apocalyptic world. Like Schofield was in hell. 

The tension just kept building and building. When they were at the farmhouse it felt like I was in the middle of a horror movie and I was waiting for a German soldier to just pop out from behind a corner. Instead he came from the sky. The second they pulled him out of the plane, I could feel a sense of doom building up in me. I don't know what Blake was thinking trying to save that German soldier, like what were they going to do with him? Tie him up and take him along on the trip. I had a feeling Blake would die since he wasn't in the trailer nearly as much as Schofield. I didn't expect it to happen so early in the film. You don't realize, at least I didn't, that Blake's wound was fatal. Broke my damn heart.

Loved the final sequence with Schofield trying to get to Colonel Mackenzie. It feels like he runs through a 10 mile trench trying to find him as the battle is just beginning. It was a weird comedic moment where Mackenzie, after Schofield saves his life by making him read the letter and withdrawing the attack, tells him to fuck off. He's almost disappointed he didn't get massacred.

Slightly above average, decent performances - with exceptions. Good - but way too on-the-nose - message. Great set/costume design, except when it's pretty obviously subpar CG and a straight-forward plot, if you disregard the underdeveloped mothers intention and the passages were logic gets stretched (like when tf did he put the breastplate on?). 

For the target audience (~12-14 year olds) this is probably quite great. For everyone else it is a fine movie. Best direct comparison I'd say would be the shitty Artemis Fowl movie (gifted protagonist, ""missing"" parent, discovers a plot that involves said parent) and in that regard the quality and heart of Enola Holmes is on a different plane of existence.

14461,"Feels like if Into the Wild had a baby with Terrance Malick...but with nothing that makes either of those great. 

Not to say I hated it or anything but it didn’t feel like it had heart. It *watched* people who had heart and occasionally gave glimpses into the multitudes of people who are trying to find happiness in the world and photographed excessively beautiful places at the golden hour but...it felt empty. 

Like, it felt like it never gave a real thought to anyone except maybe Swankie. The rest just said a couple of lines of dialogue and Frances McDormand would give a small side smile or a wave and the scene would end. Either that or the camera would just wistfully follow along while they told Frances McDormand to go stand next to something or some backdrop and just think a little bit and hopefully the audience fills in the gaps of the enigma of this nomad. 

I feel like it would’ve been better to just delete Frances McDormand entirely from the whole movie and just do a documentary. Cause the movie felt...at war with itself? Like kept trying to make an inherently sad premise really romantic and like it’s something to...look up to? But she seemed resigned to a lonely life. 

And you can say “well you can lead the same lonely life living in the modern hustle and bustle” but this felt like she was running from it all but couldn’t escape that feeling. And it never really dealt with or did anything much with that central conflict. 

But I really didn’t care for how sparse it felt on content. Anytime someone would talk (besides maybe that one scene with David), it felt like it started the 7 second countdown for when it’ll cut away before anything could be absorbed. You can say it was being unconventional and challenging but I’d posit that it’s the exact opposite. It made it feel dry and afraid to *be* challenging. Just blurt out a few sentences that are vaguely uplifting or really precisely sad and do nothing with it and then move on. 

I feel like it was trying to hit the mark of trying to be a celebration of the tiny inbetween moments of life that Roma was, but instead of making everything feel grand and majestic, it felt small and empty. 

And not that it was ever unimpressive visually or anything but it almost felt understated in its camerawork. Almost like it took the awe out of the locations and made it seem pedestrian. And that tilt up when she tosses the rock in the fire for Swanky felt so abrupt and uneven. 

I don’t know. I wouldn’t say I hated it and it certainly was very different than most things made ever. So that’s commendable. But I came away from it feeling cold. And the last few scenes all felt like they were designed to be the ending shot but it would just keep going. 

The awkward tilt up for Swanky. 

The storage place. 

Wandering in the factory place. 

Wandering in he home and backyard. 

Then finally on the road. 

Like, it doesn’t feel right when you keep thinking it’s gonna end and take it all in and then it keeps going repeatedly. 

I don’t know. I was underwhelmed and would’ve been happier with a documentary instead of a pseudo documentary that would keep cutting away from the real life perspectives to Frances McDormand doing a tiny smile or a wave or a wandering shot. Or even just do mostly the same movie but from Swanky’s perspective since she was really the heart of the movie.

Shit, Ray's way of manipulating Tony even had me hopeful at times that he and his goons actually meant no harm, that maybe they actually were just a bunch of innocent albeit drunk and obnoxious hicks. balancing out such disturbing material with humor is difficult to do, and i think Ford really succeeded here; one minute i was really unsettled and nervous, the next i thought everything was alright. however as the action built and they started groping Laura and India i knew things weren't going to end well. what made it so terrifying is you know that this shit actually happens to people. but i still didn't expect Ray getting in Tony's car with the two of them and speeding off. what a fucking scene, i was all in after that.] (#spoiler)",0

I felt it fleshed out the characters and found myself sympathizing with them.

Cyril acts as the mother who spoils their child, makes sure everything is perfect for them at all times, fulfills every indulgence asked and never really challenges them to grow. Alma comes along and becomes the stricter mother figure who challenges them on their childishness,  their unreasonableness, going so far as to literally make him eat his green vegetables.  

I think this duality of the two mother figures in Reynolds life is demonstrated perfectly in the scene after his first poisoning where the doctor comes and asks for ""Mrs Woodcock"" to which they both answer showing how they both see themselves as his primary caregiver.

15444,"I’m really interested in the politics of Chairman Fred  Sr. Namely that he put the class struggle above all else and was a committed anti-capitalist. The movie didn’t shy away from being aggressively anti-government and also showed how he built the rainbow coalition. He explicitly mentions the universal struggle for freedom of all oppressed people in a way that would have no doubt pissed off a lot of black nationalist Panthers. 

With that said, it’s my understanding that Chairman Fred Jr. did do a lot to add his fathers true ideas to the film. However I have a bone to pick with him. His dad was someone who saw through the veneer of racism and understood it was a tool used to sow dissent among the underclass. But Chairman Fred Jr. was jailed for firebombing a Korean grocery after the LA riots. I agree that the tension was high and there was blood on the Korean community’s hands, but a Marxist wouldn’t have attacked a poor to middle class grocery store owner. They would have attacked the system that let off Soon Ja Du in the first place. That’s the real enemy. 

It’s likely Chairman Fred Jr. changed in prison. But I can’t help but feel that he’s most definitely not his father and that him firebombing a Korean small business is a great metaphor for how disorganized and separated the class struggle is now. I can’t help but think of the weaknesses of the BLM movement where they’re a leaderless hydra with no direction and thus very little political power. I see it as a massive success by the government at killing off the firebrand figureheads of youth led movements and instead supplanting it with Twitter followers and the occasional riot where not much happens after. The system can handle a riot. It can’t handle genuine political change.",1

15776,"I already put some story analysis and deeper thoughts on Mank in a couple other comments in this thread but I wanted to come back and comment on Mank and its function as metatext. While I think Mank is an instant masterpiece I don’t believe you must like it to fully appreciate what David Fincher has done with this movie. 

After first watching the movie I was struck by how many described this movie as about authorship, “battle for credit”, over a masterwork of cinema. Mank is absolutely not about credit for Citizen Kane or addressing who the actual genius is, Welles or Mankiewicz, rather it is about the motivation for a story as subversive as Citizen Kane and how does something like that get made despite a system—like the old Hollywood studio system—that is designed to be mass production of entertainment for the “customers” as Mayer, in Mank, constantly refers to the audience. The studio system does not foster creativity or make room for individual expression, originality, and subversiveness, something like Citizen Kane. Two standout quotes from the Mayer character in Mank illuminate this point:

>	This is a business where the buyer gets nothing for his money but a memory. What he bought still belongs to the man who sold it, that’s the real magic of the movies

***The Mayer character delivers that gem immediately before telling the cogs of his assembly line that he is cutting wages***

>	I’m not interested in educating our customers, you want to send a message? Call Western Union

That type of mindset, that kind of business leaves no room for subversiveness or provocation or the creative expression seen in movies like Citizen Kane.

Welles is not the antagonist of this movie. Mayer and Hearst, the Hollywood power brokers are the antagonists. The system is antagonistic to Mank and Welles. All of this is happening during the formation of the Guilds and the workers in Hollywood unionizing. 

The flashbacks in Mank show what caused Mank to feel the guilt and responsibility and what he observed from within the system which served as motivation to write the story. Ultimately, it does not matter what creative percentages one assigns to Mankiewicz and Welles for the story of Citizen Kane, what matters is the kind of people it took to make it: creative, iconoclastic people willing to fight against the pressures of the system. 

Mank is an original, personal movie about how original, personal movies get made despite the pressures, obstacles, finances, personal demons, and petty squabbles working against the creative process. 

Other metatextual elements of note:

-	The line about not being able to sum up a person’s life in two hours
-	Fincher making this movie within the streaming service “system”
-	The filmmaking techniques used for Mank which mirror those of Citizen Kane
-	Hollywood being the propaganda arm of political actors and power brokers
-	And of course Mank, which ends with Oscar victories, itself being a movie immediately referred to—due to it checking all of the traditional boxes—as Oscar bait while being about the sociopolitical issues in old Hollywood and labor disputes considering Louis B Mayer created the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in an attempt to squash the uprising of labor unions in Hollywood",1

It's all just a matter of what you choose to focus on, I love that he didn't get a girlfriend or anything at the end of the movie, because that isn't neccesary, it's not about the end goal or about checking any boxes it's about enjoying whatever comes your way, journey before destination.",0

It’s amazing how little cuts they did have.

31770,"I feel like this is a bit of a Frankenstein movie, but all the parts are so good individually that it's still getting a perfect score. Animation, lighting, textures, dialogue, characters, jokes, that's all on point. But then it feels like they had a team developing Forky and his hilarious character introduction where he keeps jumping into trash cans, and another team developing Bo Peep and her epic return as a hardened lost toy who rides around a pimped remote control car, and then they had another team working on Gabby Gabby/Harmony/Benson at the antique store, and then they were like ""okay how do we put all those things together?"". Of course Woody is the common denominator as he takes it upon himself to protect Forky, then meets Bo and learns that being a lost toy isn't so bad, then meets Gabby Gabby and finds a new purpose in helping toys find a kid, and then they link it all together by saying ""Woody was overcompensating by protecting Forky to try to stay relevant in Bonnie's life but now he realizes that he needs to find a purpose outside of having a kid because no one will be like Andy"", which I guess works, but it's a mouthful. Maybe you're thinking that it's not that disjointed, but there's really nothing that links Forky, Bo and Gabby Gabby outside of Woody's journey. The fact that Forky has an emerging consciousness is not important to the plot and the fact that Bo once lived with Gabby Gabby is not important either. Add to that the fact that Buzz has his own side adventure and that the rest of the toys drive a car and you've got a Frankenstein of a movie.

Bo is really cool, but is it just superficial coolness? What has she done in all those years? In seven years she never took down the evil tyrant that's presumably been terrorizing the inhabitants of the antique store (she recommends Woody ""cuts his losses"" so clearly she thinks Gabby Gabby is dangerous), or never found her a kid of her own. I get that Woody had the compatible voice box which accelerated things for him, but Bo had SEVEN YEARS.

Forky is very funny, but it's pretty jarring that the first twenty minutes are solely dedicated to his character arc, and that his character development is closed after that, and that his trash origins are never used again in the plot. It wouldn't have changed the story if instead of making Forky Bonnie had just taken her favorite toy to kindergarten orientation and then Woody had regarded that toy as her important toy that he needed to protect. In fact, imagine that: Bonnie's parents let her take one toy to school, Bonnie takes Dolly, Woody feels useless and therefore decides to appoint himself as Dolly's bodyguard, cue funny montage of Woody being overprotective of Dolly and of Dolly getting annoyed with Woody, leading up to a heated confrontation in the RV in which Woody accidentally knocks Dolly out the window ironically while trying to ""protect her"" of an imagined danger, then Woody has to go get Dolly because she's so important to Bonnie, then they have a heart-to-heart about Woody seeing Andy grow up, then Woody spots Bo's lamp in the antique store, then Dolly gets taken prisoner by Gabby Gabby. See? It changes nothing to the story. Of course it's *funnier* with Forky because Forky is a funnier character who makes gags possible that would be impossible with Dolly, but that's what I mean when I say that all the parts are good, just unrelated. The people who made Forky are really good at making characters, and they are really good at making jokes, but it still feel like they worked separately from the people who came up with Bo Peep's side of the story.",0
1823,"I haven’t read the book but here’s my take: bronco henry groomed phil and it’s possible that phil may have eventually done the same thing to peter, but initially phil’s intent seemed to be to further isolate peter’s mother while making her fear for peter’s life, with probably the end goal of tormenting her to her breaking point so that she left or killed herself or became such an alcoholic that his brother would do something drastic. I think initially the rope was also supposed to be another gouge at peter, knowing that the boy’s father killed himself. After spending some time with the boy, however, he realizes that there’s more to him than he thought, and starts to connect with him in a way that he hadn’t felt since bronco henry, a man he could never even mourn openly and still loves. When the hides are gone and phil loses it, we see phil’s brother side with his wife on the issue. Phil is effectively isolated at this point. I don’t think the rope was actually super important to him, it was that the hides were his (just like his brother was his) and she took them. So we see the rope on bronco henry’s saddle while phil is making peter’s rope and I think, in that moment, the rope is now a symbol of their bond. The man that phil loved carried a rope and now the boy who took his side and looked up to him when he was all alone was helping him make a new one. 

All this to say that when phil is staggering around wanting to give the rope to the boy, it is a genuine attempt to commemorate their friendship while also being an opportunity for him to honor the memory of his lover.",1

It makes you wonder how far in advanced was this whole study planned and how long it was orchestrated. I mean, did they let a bunch of families adopt girls at a certain age, wait a few years and choose three families with ranging incomes and lifestyles and hope they all want a new child? As immoral as it is, it impressive they were able to orchestrate all of that. 

> Also I'm wondering if the study was picking birth parents with mental health issues or if the two twin sets is just a coincidence.

They mentioned in the documentary that the experiment had nothing to do with mental health. We can't trust everything the researchers say, but I think I do believe that. The nature/nurture thing seemed to have more relevance, and I'm not sure how much people paid attention to mental health back then anyway. I do think it's just a coincidence. I'm struggling to find a way to say this without generalizing, but I feel like mental illness is possibly fairly common in parent's who give up kids for adoption.

For example, think back to when Bridges' character lights the fire before he sits down with Darlene to eat a slice of pie. After they sit down, it shows the flames flickering behind his back hinting at his possible sinister intentions. It plays to seem like he's been laying a trap, which he is to some extent, but it's not truly as sinister as we are led to believe; He just wants his money. He didn't follow her to the El Royale, he didnt even plan on getting involved with her until he knew that the money was in her room. 

&nbsp;

This is a recurring theme throughout the movie, where we're set up to think that every character has some secret, sinister plan, but in reality it's just a bunch of people who got caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people (much like most people who get caught up in cults). Even the cult is just a group of people being led by a charismatic narcissistic sociopath who believe they've found the truth in life and just want to live their lives by their own rules. Billy Lee is the only true ""evil"" character in the story, and as far as we're shown (until the climax) he's only blatantly malevolent because he had what ""was his"" stolen from him and he wants her back. He was fucked up, no doubt, and abused his followers for sure, but he only becomes evil once he reaches the El Royale. He stumbled upon what people like Charles Manson would consider a gold mine of opportunity. He has all of the power over these people now, and has the chance to essentially play God (this mindset is very similar to that of Chigurh in No Country For Old Men, another sociopath). He didn't plan for it, but his sociopathic nature led him to a situation that is absolutely  possible and horrifying, a situation that most people don't fear until it affects them personally: being at the mercy of someone who thirsts for power and is not tied to society's definitions of ""good"" and ""evil"". In his mind, these people deserve what he is doing to him, they are liars, thieves, and hypocrites and he is a being of truth and wisdom and thus is worthy of being a judge of life and death. We know these people dont deserve what he is doing to them, which is ironic because many of us were so sure that at least one of them had sinister intentions. That is fucking scary, way scarier that ghosts or demons because we know for a fact that people like Billy Lee exist in this reality. It's verifiable fact. ",0

553,"I was concerned going into this movie because of all the outrage and thinking it wouldn't meet expectations. I saw the play, know the soundtrack, know Washington Heights and was prepared to be disappointed. 

Honestly, the movie was great and they definitely made some updates and adjustments which were for the most part ok to fit the times and be less on the nose(the looting scene, racial conflict and some other stuff). Some songs were cut and plot points needed to be expanded on, but did a decent job overall. Sonny and Abuela were my favorite characters and had the best parts in my opinion where things got really emotional and heartfelt. 

The CGI was awful in some parts but that can be because of the fantasy nature of some scenes where it seemed deliberately cheesy. The bad CGI gum on Usnavi's shoe where he spins a manhole is an example and can take you out of the film. Same goes for the lip-syncing in some scenes where it breaks that suspension of belief. Definitely needed more of Benny and Nina. 

And to address the controversy about the lack of Afro Dominicans. The actor that plays Nina identifies as Afro Dominican, but the same people criticizing would say that she isn't Afro Dominican or is not representative because of how she looks, which is problematic in itself. 

I get it, Washington Heights is very diverse, but there are a lot of different people from different backgrounds, and the film did a great job of hammering that point home. And unless you get a 23 and Me, you wouldn't be able to tell anything and even then it's an issue because DNA results don't define people. That was a solid representation of a slice of Washington Heights in the High Bridge area.

42953,"Quick explanation of the how I saw the events of the film connecting together (friends of mine were confused, so maybe this will help anyone in a similar situation):

The grandma was the leader and founder of the cult, and they needed a host for Paimon. Originally, the grandmother wanted to place Paimon into her own son, Annie’s brother, but he killed himself before Paimon was able to take control, so the grandmother’s next plan was to place Paimon within Annie’s son, but Peter was kept away from her as a child, so she had to place Paimon within Charlie. 

Paimon was always within Charlie, but couldn’t take full control of a female host, that’s why grandma wanted Charlie to be a boy. Peter was the intended host but was kept away from the grandmother, so she was unable to “give” Paimon to him (likely done through the breast milk of the grandmother, which is why she insisted on feeding Charlie). Paimon/the cult then hatched the plan to have Peter inadvertently kill Charlie, which released Paimon while simultaneously bringing Peter to his most vulnerable state, which was one of the conditions needed for Paimon to possess him. Paimon was embodied by the blue light which traveled from Charlie, to the notebook, to Annie, and ultimately to Peter, who then became Paimon after jumping out of the window. ",0

36347,"Favorite movie of the year!

Jokes aside, I really did love this film. Reminds me of a mixture of Knives Out and Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels but leaves you with a great mystery with an action angle. Loved that Grant was a cinefile and framed the story to make it more action oriented. While the score was sorta kinda generic I don't think it subtracts any points off the film. Along with the snappy edits made this film fly by and how they set it up for a possible but not nessisarily needed sequel feel more welcomed and not groan inducing

 It even didn't bother me that Matthew McConaughey used British slang, which normally would because people who tend to be fluent in the language and move to a different area tend to adapt the accent from time to time, while retaining his accent because he grown accustomed to the culture. 

This film also made me realize and come to accept that Colin Ferrell is one of my favorite actors after years of saying ""I love this film"" and sure enough he's in it with 7 Psychopaths and In Bruges being stand outs with the Lobster being a more subtle example of how excellent he is with delivery and mannerisms with a character.

Hanks and Odenkirk are the MVP's with Hanks balancing gruff and likability with ease. Meryl Streep is very good but can become Oscar bait-y at times.

Spielberg and Kaminski's camerawork is the highlight. There's not a better director when it comes to working with the camera than Spielberg.

73110,"First film of 2017 and it was eeeeh. Probably down to me not being a musical fan though.

Went into the film blind apart from the knowledge of it being a Disney film. It delivered in the aspect of the animation, visually the most stunning film I've ever seen, tons of Screenshot worthy scenes and at ~~some~~ many parts of the film I was amazed by the detail of the animations.

Plot wise, preetty cookie cutter. Similarly to my last movie, Sing, pretty predictable in many parts, though this one has many more moments where you go ""oh, I didn't exactly expect that"". One of those films where you would be fine with watching, but there really isn't much to dig by watching it again, too little depth and things just happen because it has to without much purpose.

Can't comment on the songs since I never liked musical segments in every film I've ever watched anyway.

Overall, if you're into musicals, go for it, even if you're not a fan of musicals consider going for it anyway since the movie is 2 whole hours of eye candy.",0

49410,"I thought it was a stunning follow-up to *Ex Machina*, though I can see why the studio worried about its appeal.

I thought the cancer references were an interesting motif; the film is full of them. It opens with Lena giving a lecture on cancer cells. She is later seen reading *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*, which is about a woman who died of cancer and produced the first immortal line of human cells. Ventress is said to have cancer. Shepard's daughter died of leukemia. So many shots of cells dividing. I think the Shimmer's effects are a kind of cancer, in a way. It caused all of the normal cellular mechanisms to fall apart and bodies to grow in unregulated ways. That's exactly what a cancer does, too.

In some ways, the Shimmer appears to symbolize the reversal of evolution rather than evolution itself. Evolution has been a 4-billion-year process of differentiation. But inside the Shimmer, the characters and creatures steal different parts of each other and all begin to lose the features that make them unique individuals.

I loved the ambiguity of the ending. Was Lena still herself? How much of her original personality remained intact after the Shimmer? Was the Kane in the hospital facility an alien? Definitely thought-provoking. Can't wait to re-watch it!",0

this is seen in the father’s reaction when asked if he loved his wife, seen in the unequal treatment in the son and daughter, in which the son is clearly the favourite. the father doesn’t show the same obvious signs of affection towards her, as he does to his son. similarly, the ramen don situation highlights this. the mother asks the son, then her husband, and then chooses to eat it. notice how nobody in the family caught on to their own daughter getting into relationships with not one, but TWO tutors. love and family takes the backseat, and in the end that’s what causes the wealthy father’s death.",1

The second act was my favorite, Diana was amazing. Both in regards to fun and action scenes. That battleground / Veld fight scene was fantastic, a truly great moment. Steve and Diana had great chemistry, again, they really nailed both the casting and the writing for these roles. The supporting characters were quite fun, too.

The third act was my least favorite, but mainly because I didn't like any of the villains, but it wasn't that bad. I like that Steve died because of his sacrifice, that he wasn't killed.

All-around, it was a great movie - not a cinematic masterpiece, but certainly an amazing blockbuster. I think the hype is deserved and I hope that the movie does very well in the BO.",0

Which I found much more compelling.

 I know a lot of people will rightfully shout out Will Smith — but Aunjanue Ellis as Brandy truly affected me in that scene in the kitchen, and should receive award buzz for this performance.

I rarely have walked out of a 2.5 hour film saying “God I wish that were longer” — but I would have enjoyed a film double it’s length that delved into Serena and Venus’s dynamic and rise in the professional space, from their perspective.

36854,"I saw the movie a few days ago and liked it a lot, even though i find Paul Feig's agenda-driven work and comedic style insufferable most times.

I liked the plot more and more as time went on. I did enjoy the intro scenes that established Kate/Katrina's history and current situation, and liked how they established early that she's obsessed with George Michael (hence creating a theme to the story that fits the title), but for the first quarter of the movie it really seemed like the reviews were gonna be correct that this is a bland cookie-cutter rom-com meant for easy holiday-season money.

However I grew more intrigued with what was happening between Kate and Tom, and I noticed peculiar patterns. I first suspected something when he started disappearing more and more as she was working on herself. That opened the doors for the ""ghost/hallucination"" theory.

The first sign, however, that I felt this theory was possibly true was when Kate goes inside the homeless shelter for the first time to look for him. The fact that none of the volunteers knew who he was at all, despite him saying he worked there, set off alarms. Now granted, I also felt it's possible that he lied as a trick to get her in the building to volunteer, but either way that's when I first suspected something was up.

Also, I found it weird that Santa asked Kate about Tom, speaking of him as if she's seen him too. I don't recall Kate talking about looking at him through windows, so can anyone tell me if they remember Santa seeing him? Please let me know.

Anyway the thing that REALLY convinced me Tom was a ghost/hallucination was when, after Kate had her life pretty much back together, she hadn't seen him for weeks, and she was worried, and all of a sudden she sees him in that part, and during the conversation they have he said ""you can't depend on me"". I had known through the way the movie played out from middle to now that this wasn't going to be a typical rom-com, so it would have been cheesy to make him out to be a deadbeat who needed fixing, especially since she was the deadbeat and the one who needed to be ""fixed"" and he was the therapist to her. It was then I knew that the plot twist was incoming. She needed him less and less and he appeared less and less, so it only made sense

Many seem to hate it, but I really liked the plot twist. It fit with the overall plot of the movie, didn't feel out of character, and it's also an atypical twist in a romantic comedy.

As for the rest of the movie itself, I liked it a lot. Funny in a lot of parts, the characters were very relatable even with outlandish quirks some had, and the story made sense overall. My favorite aspect was Emilia Clarke's acting, but that's also what drove me to see the film in the first place. The acting was great from all the actors and actresses, especially Emma Thompson and the woman who played Santa. 

Pretty much the only negative that stood out was the political commentary/statements about Brexit. I wasn't surprised at all given it was a Paul Feig movie and he has to insert politics into all his work lately, and ultimately those parts drew nothing more than an eyeroll from me, but overall I felt that Kate's family being established as immigrants was already completed and the extra commentary took away from the plot, as well as potentially divide audience members unnecessarily (im sure some pro-Brexit supporters watched it too). On top of the obvious political leaning in the message, it was also inaccurately portrayed, because the immigration issue is focused mostly on Muslim and Middle Eastern immigrants when it comes to the ""Britain First"" movement. Sure theres a pocket group that only wants British people, but the majority of them support immigrants from the rest of Europe just fine.

Anyway, to sum it all up, it wasn't perfect, and it's not the next ""Love, Actually"", but it's a damn fine Christmas Rom-Com that I'm considering buying when it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray",0

Maybe I'm overreading it, but I think they are happy with the dreams they chose to follow. Their art came first, and their love was a close second. Of course they wish they could have it all, but they are satisfied with what they got.",1

I think the movie did a very good job of showing the horrors of war without being shocking or showing close ups. Besides when he puts his hand through the German, I think every dead body, whether it was horse, dog, or soldier, was shown in passing. Every dead body they showed was a soldier who had a family who's devastated over their death, but they just need to keep moving.",1

I'll even leave alone the fact that despite being America's most top secret unit and the best of the best, no one wonders how they're being tracked everywhere.

But why shoehorn some twist ending plot point into all of this and end it with a bunch of questions.  Why is Wahlberg still alive?  Why was the kid there?  How could the Russian mother know overwatch killed her son?  How did they learn everything they did despite being the most secret of secrets.  How do they possibly setup this entire plot just to get the overwatch team?  How are they able to deploy a kill team to their location in just 3 hours?

2. I think she had planted the monkey long before. She set a magic charm on the monkey doll that meant she would automatically resurrect as the monkey if she died. That's why she tells Kubo to keep the monkey doll with him at all times.

3. She probably put some amount of her magic inside the monkey doll for the resurrection thing. Once she is the monkey, she lives off that amount of magic, and it's enough to keep her alive for a few days, but after that she's gone.

4. He should have, but he didn't. I didn't either.

Personally, despite the change in film technique, I took the ending ostensibly on its face. The shift in medium does t mean that what's happening isn't real In the movie.

It's a last joyous grasp for Moonie's quickly ending childhood. 

But it's a temporary escape. The Magic Kingdom is a magical fairytale, but we know it ends. The park closes at night. Moonie will be taken away by CPS. 

It's bittersweet because we know the magic that she, Jancy, and we as the audience are experiencing can't last.

I wonder if Lonergan ever thought of including flashback scenes of media coverage of the tragic house fire. This type of terrible situation is someone like Nancy Grace's wet dream (my thoughts on how Nancy covered tragic stories on her show is a different story). I feel like in the days/weeks/months following there would be extensive coverage of the events. It can be assumed that Lee was ultimately exonerated of any wrong doing in the death of his three children, correct? If that was truly the case, even if it didn't occur in a social media era, it definitely did occur in an era where stories like these would dominate TV/radio news programs, daytime talk shows, newspapers, etc etc. A young father of three children holds party at his house with his buddies until 2-3am in the morning, where cannabis, cocaine, and lots of alcohol was consumed. When the party is ended by his wife, the father sets the fireplace to warm the house and then decides to go to a nearby corner store. Intoxicated and not wanting to drive, the father decides to walk even though it's an altogether 40 minute trip by foot. 10 minutes into his trek, he can't remember if he put the fireplace screen up but figures it will be okay and decides to continue walking to the store. When he returns, he is greeted by the scene of his young wife resisting fire fighters and screaming that her kids are still in the house, which is now completely ablaze. His wife survives, but his three kids (one of them only a couple years old if that) do not. 

The father admits to authorities that he wasn't sure whether he put the screen up or not before leaving to go to the store. He also openly admits of the substance abuse that went on earlier that night.

It's obvious that Lee was blamed by a lot of people in the community for the fire, including his (eventual ex) wife. But I would wager the story reached beyond just his community. If he was in fact fully exonerated of any responsibility in the death of his three children, I would wager that the story went national for at least awhile. We can all imagine the amount of guilt Lee feels about his kids fate even without the public and media scrutiny. But I can't imagine the amount of stress, anxiety, and overall darkness the man went through if he had to deal with this tragedy in the public eye.

I don't know, this thought just made Lee's story even more powerful and sad. ",1

But, she intentionally had Jo reject Laurie and instead wedded her to a random person she introduced, as sort of a joke and FU to the editor.

Gerwig wanted to incorporate this story into the movie somehow, so she set up Jo to be sort of a stand-in for Alcott (who herself never married).  The monetary terms that Jo negotiates in the movie were apparently identical to the actual terms that Alcott negotiated for ""Little Women"" herself.  I think the movie ending in this implies that Jo should not have married anyone, but ends up marrying Friedrich so that there is a feel-good, happy ""storybook"" ending.  I really liked it : )",1

The film begins with basic training footage, in black and white, building to the moment when the soldiers go to the Western Front. That’s when the movie transitions into startling color. Was Jackson going for a dramatic, “Wizard of Oz”-style effect? Well, not exactly.

“It was all to do with the budget,” he said. Originally the documentary was to be about half an hour long. “The budget we had was to colorize about 30 to 40 minutes of film.” But as he and his team listened to the interviews, what the veterans said about training provided much-needed context, and the filmmakers didn’t want their movie to “jump straight into the trenches.” Still, the budget wasn’t flexible. So they settled on a feature-length movie with restored black-and-white footage bookending the dramatic, full-color highlights.",0

Clearly he is not fully straight, but he lies somewhere in a grey area. And as someone who is bisexual, I very much appreciate this statement. ",1

With the movie ending with the worst possible outcome for the farm, the uncertainty turned into reality and by experiencing it and coming out knowing that the family deeply cared for each other, I think that in an ironic way, this actually lifted a big weight off of her shoulders.

To me, Monica's goals have always been family first and her being unhappy with rural life wasn't really that big of a deal, just her being afraid of uncertainty. The ending was heavily hinting that the family will be just alright.",1

It did fall into retarded humans vs zombies trap though as most of the issues could have been easily prevented with a bit of caution. The Vic arc was completely unnecessary and felt utterly pointless.  

I wish this movie would have taken 28 days later or The Road route to not insult human inteligence that much. Be it a bit more darker and slower. Just the guy traveling around with his daughter looking for home and everything falls short.

1) Rob: he shares with Amir in the diner that he feels as though if he never looked for his pig, she would still be alive in his head. He wishes he could have taken the ""ignorance is bliss"" approach after already experiencing crippling grief from his wife's passing.
2) Amir: He tries to convince himself that his mom is dead, and mentions this to Rob. It's easier for him to think of her in past tense.
3) Amir's Dad: following his self-serving tendencies, he delays his wife's death (to her detriment) in an attempt to presumably delay the grief that would come with it.

One last thought: though I was initially crushed for Rob at the end, I think Amir provides him with enough purpose to make it through, even if that means seeing him once every Thursday. Rob gave Amir some crucial fatherly experiences (e.g. showing him how to cook the meal at his dad's home) and Amir gave Rob care and conversation that he hadn't experienced in years.

Fred Rogers respected children. He didn’t think of them as “almost people,” he thought of them as actual human beings who contribute to the world now. 


Rogers is a pivotal piece of why children’s film can have mature themes. I don’t think “The Incredibles,” “Zootopia,” or even “Gravity Falls” could exist today without Rogers, which may sound weird to say. These pieces of entertainment appeal to kids not despite of, but because of their dynamics. 


Kids are such an important piece of society, and if we insult their intelligence and pretend that they’re barely even humans yet than we are doing something incredibly wrong. “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” hammers this point home in the most beautiful way possible.",0

When Kane (alien) comes home, he bleeds and gets sick, because he has yet to fully adapt to our environment. Water / air makes him sick. When Lena drinks the water, she looks for blood and sees none; the adaption is complete and they no longer needed the shimmer to survive.

The cynic in me just sees this whole thing as a black culture cash grab.

I just dont agree with the criticisms of this movie at all, although I can kind understand it. It is maybe a little long/slow towards the end but I think that chloe zhao wanted to really drive the point home on the b plot of the movie if you will. (which was ferns turmoil of nomadic life versus normal life). I didn't feel like it was poverty porn at all. Maybe it wasn't in your face this is absolutely horrible lifestyle but its pretty clear that this isn't a great lifestyle. I dont agree that it would've been better as a documentary, I feel like then it would've definitely been poverty porn. There's no conflict? Its a movie about the journey of loss. Its reflective, therapeutic. I think its supposed to be an ""empty"" movie to really exemplify the nomadic lifestyle these people live. Same for not being too ""invested"" in the side characters (although I was). Its a movie about nomads, they really just form summer camp esque relationships where they drift in and out of each others lives but intensity of the relationship in those moments are heightened due to their circumstances. Yea some of these relationships dont get closure, some of these relationships are incomplete, most dont get a happy ending but that's life right?

64676,"Finally, finally got to sit down and watch this after months of wanting to. 

As a whole, I really enjoyed it. There were some frustrating aspects of this film, but I appreciated them as I suspect that every detail of this movie was placed in it for a reason.

The main complaint I see about it is plot, or lack of plot. Aside from the ending, it seems like that's the man thing people had issue with. I understand that, but I tend to think that plot isn't everything, it's just that most novels, movies, etc. are driven by a linear plot. This one wasn't. For some, that's frustrating. It was for me a bit frustrating as well, but I think the way events in the story are presented here are almost designed to frustrate, and I'd argue that it forces viewers to experience the world through the eyes of a child, where you have little agency and even less of a grasp on what you're doing that day to make progress through your life. I could also see how the same presentation reflects the daily lives of poor people like those depicted: Slogging through a mundane existence in a bleak place, looking for little blips of excitement or respite to color your day. 

As far as the realism on display here in both setting and characters, it's outstanding. Just superb. It's easy to despise Halley, and that's the point. It's easy to wait for Bobby to be a hero or Moonie to do something profound (and unrealistic) to change Moonie's fate, but they don't, and that's also done on purpose. I don't think this movie was ever intent on resorting to cliche to ""solve"" the problems of the characters. If this were a novel, it'd be literary journalism, not a dime store paperback. 

I hope I don't sound snobbish writing this. I didn't love the ending, and I often hated Halley. I felt frustrated at times, as I said, by the plot structure. But overall, I truly enjoyed this experience, I think it was a job well done, and I'm glad I finally got to watch it.",0

Of course none of that would be possible without the extraordinary work of the bajillion CG artists who worked to make this film as stunning as it is. It's easy to heap praise on the voice actors, who all certainly did amazing jobs, but their performances came to vivid life thanks to those artists.

I know some people didn't like the intrusion of the songs, but this movie is like a myth, and its songs are the most vivid reminders of the timelessness of this story.

This movie simultaneously made me proud to be human, and encouraged me to remember my responsibility to nature. I had a classic Disney experience.

\- Grandmother bringing rare Korean ingredients to her daughter, including Korean herbal medicine. *We are so spoiled now with multiple choices in Korean supermarkets in the U.S. and the availability of so many things that weren't available. My aunt who immigrated in the 70s made kimchi with American cabbage.* 

**Language**  
\- OK, it was weird. Stephen Yeun plays a Korean immigrant, but his Korean accent is noticeable and his only slightly accented English is very good. *I will say his Korean has improved over the years. And apparently he had multiple language teachers in this movie.*  
\- It was also a little weird that the children spoke mostly in English to their parents and their parents responded in Korean. Apparently this is normal in some households.  
\- According to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8IyCyJXSGk) interview with Bong Joon Ho and Youn Yuh-jung (grandmother), the original script was written in English and then translated to Korean (for the Korean language parts, which is most).

8143,"I'm not a big PTA fan in general, but I really loved this movie.  I thought it was funny, beautifully shot, and wonderfully acted.  Alana Haim is rightly getting tons of praise, but I thought Cooper Hoffman also gave one of the best performances of the year.

The movie had really interesting themes about the way we deal with aging and how we view the passage of time.  Gary is a high schooler who isn't satisfied to just enjoy being a kid - he wants to grow up: have a career, start businesses, and be sophisticated.  He relishes being a regular at a nice restaurant, and brags to his friends that he could get them martinis.  It's no wonder he's drawn to an older woman like Alana and tries so hard to impress her.  

Alana, on the other hand, is stuck in a rut and struggling with adulthood.  Spending time with Gary feels like a return to earlier, simpler times.  I think her arc is especially interesting. Throughout the movie, she questions why she's hanging out with Gary and his friends instead of growing up.  After the running out of gas sequence, she seems fed up with how immature Gary is and wants to make a change.  She starts working in Sachs' office, and her relationship with Gary changes noticeably - she starts getting annoyed at him for messing up tasks and for not thinking about the  bigger picture beyond himself and his friends.  This continues up until the scene where Sachs invites her for a drink, only to reveal that she is being used as a cover.  Once Alana is reminded of how bleak and horrible the adult world can be, her first reaction is to go find Gary.  Both characters are struggling to be satisfied with where they are in their lives, and are using the other one to fill what they feel is missing. 

Most nostalgia movies show a glossy version of the past where characters are at the peak of their lives.  Licorice Pizza is a throwback movie that centers around two characters who are fundamentally unhappy with the stage of life they're in.  I found that really interesting.  It's definitely a somewhat bittersweet movie, but it's highly watchable and it leaves you with a lot to think about.",1

He isn't that over protective and was willing to let Dory take them to California so she could meet her family. He would BARELY let Nemo go to school in the first movie and now he's taking him across the ocean. Thats development. 

Also the Octopus is going to be unrealistic. Its a cartoon. Dory reads in english even though there are no books underwater. It doesnt need to make sense in our world as long as it makes sense in theres. Thats what makes it a movie. And the movie starts with old jokes to get you invested. Its familiar. 

Just keep swimming doesn't literally mean keep swimming, it means keep moving forward and you'll succeed. Hank would have stayed and hid forever if Dory didn't drag him out so the kid could touch him. 

And Nemo absolutely called Marlin out. Did we even watch the same movie? He was mad his dad kept doubting her and wanted him to trust her to do what she had to do.

It seemed to me that the movie was about the way power corrupts, and the almost inevitable way that dogma, religion, ideology, can become perverted and twisted. The witches were so corrupt and venal that they were unable to recognize their own god when she returned to them. They had all this power and they used it on petty games (stripping and mocking the security guard) and outright sadism (the pleasure they took in driving the hooks into Olga.) Their leader was the literal manifestation of this, with her deformities and decay, and yet the witches blame their inability to restore Markos' body on the girls; it was all the girls' fault for not being somehow perfect, and never their own fault for not doing it right. So Suspiria returns and gives them ample time to recognize her, but they fail. The only one who passes the test in any way is Blanc. She finally shows some small amount of love in attempting to protect Suzie from Markos. So the angel of death passes over and burns the rot from the coven.

One last question: why did that ASSHOLE corporate dude hate Miles so much? Did it all really start over the whole situation with the kid opening up the car and being told to stop? Not a huge complaint here or anything, I may have missed something. But holy crap I hated that guy so much - props to the actor for being so easy to root against.

Good lord I loved this film. It felt like the old Pixar but also very unique in the way it was portraying a different culture. I was a bit worried that as an American I wouldn’t appreciate the holiday or customs but I was so elated to see the film being about family at its core and how anyone could appreciate it. My family is extremely important to me but there has always been lots of drama and some of the stuff in here was actually a bit similar to what I’ve experienced. I walked away feeling enlightened. 

The film made me cry, not tear up, cry. There were two times where I was full blown crying at how beautiful or sad(sometimes both) the story was. Sure I can do some nitpicking but when a movie’s story is that good to the point of moving me to tears it did something right in a BIG way. 

This is the first Pixar film that has made me cry, it feels very unique, the world building is fantastic as are the visuals and acting. The whole film feels like a celebration of life and love even though it’s dealing with some pretty dark subject matter in death. No lame or forced jokes.

  Everyone ignores orders to stay with Li and protect him throughout the movie. At the bakery, everyone is cursing at Mark since he's talking to the one guy out front and he ignores orders to leave.

> Above all, the film misunderstands Christie and does not strike the right tone: it treats what is a cynical, tidy little genre piece as if it were a Greek tragedy.

On this point, I think the film spent far too much time focusing on the character of Poirot. Clearly they were trying to introduce him as a protagonist in the event of a sequel, but he is not intended to be an interesting character with a ton of screen time. Poirot exists to guide the reader through the mystery and put the pieces together at the end, but in all of his stories it's the supporting cast and the mystery itself that are the stars. He is very different to someone like Sherlock Holmes, but Branagh failed to realise this. ",0

68848,"Manchester By The Sea was easily the best film I've seen all year and I can't really explain way. So much emotion packaged into a incredible film. I honestly think the November might be a stronger Oscar session/good movie month than December. We got Arrival (my number 2), Loving (strong 8/10), The Edge of Seventeen (one of the best coming of age films I've seen in a long time) and a few more I still need to see (Hacksaw Ridge, Nocturnal Animals, Miss Sloane, Lion, Elle) along with some October limiteds that expanded in November (Certain Woman, and Moonlight).

As for Manchester By The Sea it's self, It's a beautiful shot and written film. It almost feels as if the direction is a fly on the wall style. It feels like your peering into these peoples lives and it works. Extremely well.

Casey Affleck gives one of the most subdued performances I've ever seen. I know this is cliche, but this movie feels real. Very real.

One of the best parts is watching Lucas Hedges. We're here watching a teenager, that I for one, completely understood. He was very much a good kid that kept fucking things up. He has a band, and he knows they suck. He has two girlfriends, and two sets of friends to go along with them. He tries, but mostly succeeds at little to nothing in this film.

The film never claimed to be ""academic"".  In fact Jackson literally stated this aspect.   Moreover, the point was immersion.  Being a ""history buff"" is not about flexing as much raw historical data you can fit in 2 hours.   Even that criticism is baseless; the entire audio was strictly veterans detailing their experiences...

This was a unique take on WWI, full of invaluable knowledge and experience.  In fact it is what academic films always miss, the humanity.   Seeing the faces of the youth, experiencing the sudden chaos that is war.  This was always lost in the grainy footage of ""history buff"" verified films.  You felt the dread, the despair, the hope; everything.   In short it was a masterclass presentation of humanity, which literally and figuratively added color to an experience that was previously obscure and too academic.

25015,"First off, the Directed by Robert Zemeckis got probably the biggest laugh I'll conjure for a movie this year. 

Man, this movie is a fuckin trip. I expected nothing less from Kaufman but even with Synecdoche being one of my top five movies this still unsettled me and took me by surprise in a big way. 

I think what's different is that while Synecdoche gets into the weirdness right away and tells you up front you're in for some shit, this movie almost feels like a normal movie for the first 40 minutes or so. There's a 20 minutes dialogue scene in the car to start it off and even though there's some oddities like Jake seemingly stepping on the toes of her thoughts, this could easily be like any other relationship drama up until after dinner. I felt it was much more unsettling when things started getting weird later because we'd been introduced to this relatively normal story up until then. 

Enter David Thewlis and Toni Collette, the real gems of this movie. I loved everyone involved but their portrayal was ""universal in the intimate"" for me. Really felt like we were dealing with an old and isolated couple. They got a chance to shine in that dinner scene and even moreso once the rapid aging/de-aging sets in. 

Overall, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this movie. The themes are strong and the reveals are interesting, but it's definitely going to take a few watches to get everything out of it and I'm looking forward to it. On a single watch I got the idea that a lot of this revolved around Jake more than the girl. 

It seemed like this movie was exploring two or more possible timelines at once. One in which they are in a relationship but she is thinking of leaving all the time, and one in which they maybe never dated, like she said when she spoke to the janitor that describing him would be like describing a mosquito that once bit her, and he is a janitor in his old age who is mocked by the kids and watching dumb love stories in his spare time. Each one revolved more around Jake's insecurity so while she was the center of the movie I have a feeling he was the one at the real focus. 

There are lots of clues and I'm not sure what to make of them yet. She seemed to be studying everything depending on the scene. Ageism, art, poetry, genetics. They each fit the theme but I think this works towards the idea that she is more of a creation of his, flowing in and out of professions as needed for his ideal girlfriend. Similar to how her name is a little fluid, the specifics seem to change a lot. This kind of tells me that they may have never even dated and a lot of this movie is a hallucination or creation of a sad and lonely man. In that way it reminded me of Synecdoche, how the whole thing can be seen as a tale of regret. 

This could arguably be reinforced by the stage performance at the end. He was putting on a show for the people and even the people watching were obviously fake shown by the stage aged makeup. He's entertaining himself and dreaming of the glory of appreciation. At least that's how I read it. 

It's hard to say for sure. This movie oddly felt more straightforward than Synecdoche or Anomalisa, but I think after watching it is actually much less so. Those movies are odd but their plots are very straightforward and in the present whereas this movie feels very abstract. I'm excited to read some interpretations in this thread, that's for sure. 

I'm feeling a solid 7/10 on this one. I think the step more towards the abstract was an iffy move for Kaufman, as if his movies aren't already abstract enough. BUT I am excited to rewatch this down the line and I can only see that score going up once I do.

Edit: worth mentioning that the song Jake sings at the end is called Lonely Room and it's from Oklahoma! It's a song where the antagonist of the show, who's main motivation is that he wants the woman that is in love with the protagonist, sings about how lonely he is and how much he thinks about having her.

60749,"I really liked this movie. It wasn't perfect, but was one of the more enjoyable I've seen this year. Even with some flaws I found myself engaged and into it the whole time. I didn't know til this thread this guy wrote Sicario and Hell or High Water. He's building quite the writing resume, I'll have to be on the lookout for his next work. 

The star of the movie to me was the reservation. It was really interesting seeing the desolation and isolation and vastness and desperation of it.  It was cool getting to see a world that isn't used very often and one most people will never see.  I do wish there had been more. The reservation life fascinated me. But outside of the few homes and the junkie trailer and the drill site, we didn't get much else. I wish it had explored a little more of the circumstances of these people and gave us a larger taste. They talked about the life there but didn't show a whole lot of it. 

I thought Jeremy Renner was really good. One of his best performances I think. I especially liked his scene telling Olsen about his daughter. That got me choked up. Olsen was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but not bad at all. I didn't know Jon Bernthal was in the movie and at first when he opened the door I thought he was the rapist/killer and was thinking, of course, this guy plays such a great asshole. Turns out he wasn't the asshole after all.

A few things I wasn't a fan of.  Nitpicky, but I really didn't like the conversation between Renner and the brother in the cop truck. The conversation content was alright but it felt out of place and unrealistic in that situation. A little contrived.  I thought the last act was too rushed. It needed more time to breathe. The tension was building and then it exploded quickly and was over.  It also was a little chaotic. Why are cops just walking along with armed workers when they are there to investigate a rape/murder. Seemed odd to me. I can't imagine too many officers being comfortable going to question somebody with a guy with a loaded shotgun right next to them. Then the door scene got tense and they switched to the flashback. I don't know how I would have done it better but I would have liked the flashback scene and the door scene without interrupting the tension building in the door scene.  And the flashback was off to me. I maybe would have liked that to breathe a little more and build up and last longer. Also, I don't necessarily *want* more assault but the coroner's story didn't really match up with the scene. He described multiple people or multiple occasions and we didn't get that. Just seemed inconsistent. Next, I didn't understand how Renner knew what was about to happen, and I guess he radioed the cop and the cop yelled to get away from the door. Then a second later the shotgun goes off. How did he know the exact second to warn? Did the cop have a hunch? Why let her go to the door in the first place? Maybe I missed something. Then the shootout has like 40 point blank shots going off but they all seem to be alive for a while like they were only shooting each others legs of something, it felt off. The whole scene was a little clumsy. Not bad but could have been more thought out and methodical. I still don't know how Renner knew what happened and knew which guy it was and all that at the end. Maybe I missed something again. And the scene where he lets the guy run needed more gravity to it. In principle I liked it, but he ran like 50 yards and collapsed. Could have had a lot more weight to it and didn't leave me as satisfied as I wanted to be with it. Alsonwhat happened to Matt? Was he the second body they found? Did they not identify it before they went looking  for him? That whole thing left me confused. And I wish there had been more resolution. Did all the cops die? His friend cop got killed and we just see him hanging out with Olsen. What about his kid, what about his wife. I just think it needed like 20-30 more minutes in the last act to flesh it all out properly. 

All that said I did like it. I'll watch it again and recommend it for sure.",0
61903,"I’ll take the 70’s version over this all day long for quite a few reasons but number one is the lack of subtle detective work on display in this one. A pure joy of Poirot is him asking seemingly mundane questions and playing his cards close to his chest. Then revealing at the end how he arrived from simple seemingly irrelevant anecdotes to incredibly important revelations. Poirot is a genius. The audience is not.

But in this version, he is mostly throwing all his ideas out there, bluntly and openly tying everyone to the Armstrong case without much subtlety  or mystery and the rest of the evidence falls by the way side.

Just one example is his interrogation of Schmidt. In the 70’s version he asks her numerous questions before randomly complimenting her good cooking. She brags “all my ladies have said so” before her smile vanishes and Poirot laughs to himself. He trapped her, learned something and revealed nothing. Only later does he explain her connection to the Armstrong’s when he is good and ready. In this version he basically makes that deduction instantly upon talking to her for a minute and says it then and there. It’s just not very detectiv-y.",0

Key word: marginalized. If you are not in a marginalized group you have likely never been the target of this.

The thing is, when you say ""no reputable and unbiased scientific proof""? This isn't the same thing as chemical reactions in vaccines. That is a physical science. This is a **social** science.

We're meant to think he'll let Santino live by the end of the movie because we know he's capable of peace and because going against the Continental is a dangerous move (though personally I got the vibe he'd die in the Continental the moment he showed the marker to John).",0

Hosts and guests aren't on camera usually so they are more open and honest, you don't feel like they're performing. And for podcasts like Indoor Kids, You Made It Wierd, WTF, and Nerdist (early Nerdist in particular), you just start to feel a connection with the hosts because it's like you're in the room with them.

So when your favorite hosts start getting big and the mainstream starts to really enjoy them, it's like you've introduced a close friend to a much bigger group of friends and they're hitting it off.

15731,"I imagine that watching Mank without any previous knowledge of Citizen Kane and the social circles of contemporary Hollywood will be like watching Avengers Endgame without having seen anything else from the MCU. It’s for insiders. It relies on the audience’s repertoire to work. And in this case, that makes for some sort of elitist film (that’s not a critique, just a statement of fact).

The movie is rigid to the point of becoming dull, except for a few sequences when it comes to life, usually relying on the impact of the dialogues, that are well-written and theatrical, but not strong enough to turn the film into an insightful character study. For instance: a lot is said about politics, but the script never addresses the roots of Mank’s political ideology or, for that matter, any of his personality traits and relationships (or lack of). No wonder Amanda Seyfriend is being hailed as the MVP, since she’s the only one that establishes some meaningful connection with Mank and adds a much needed humanity to his character.

Overall, it’s form over substance, and that’s also true when it comes to Fincher’s directorial choices (his attempt to replicate the aesthetics of the time eventually works against the movie, like the obvious script headings leading to flashbacks). As an admirer of Citizen Kane and a movie-buff, I was eager to love Mank, but, IMO, it’s just too bland, too empty to even earn a spot amongst Fincher’s best.",1

54551,"One thing I really enjoyed was how the movie wasn't some big story wrapped up in a 2 hour capsule where the credits roll and everything is a-okay now. It was about Lady Bird's life and you could really get a sense for the time before the movie started and then after it finished you could feel like there was going to be more to her life. It wasn't the case where the credit roll and everything stops sorta thing if that makes sense. Like if the whole movie is all about just one thing then at the very end that thing comes true and then credit roll. This was just a 2 hour condensed showing of this girls last 2ish years of highschool into college and I think that helped with the realism of it because it was so familiar to everyone. And the character were familiar at least to me as well because everyone felt like an actual person with redeeming characteristics and faults- no just one hero or whatever.
Tbh I think it really just comes down to how well you connect to the characters, because even though Lady Bird was the main character I went on for most of the movie in this weird balance was disliking her a whole lot but at the same time wishing I could just reach through the screen and give her a hug bc her mom wasn't doing that for her. I think that emotional response that came out of me is why I enjoyed the film so much.",1

But the scene where Mr Kim is talking to Mr Park about the high end service business. He is discussing how he was this prestigious driver being poached by this company and how he decided to take the job with Mr Park instead. Seemingly crossing that line and as this happens and truck cuts him off and makes him focus on driving again.

It’s almost like a “stay in your lane” metaphor and it even causes Mr Kim to be like “hey focus on the road” don’t keep looking at me back here.

It took too long to get to the creation of the VU, and not enough time on the demise of the VU, which felt like a small paragraph in this novel of a documentary.

All that power and success, but he *still* has a need to feel just that *little* bit more powerful by jerking around these people who he sees as weaker.

It goes with Leo’s last, quite poignant, line in the movie:

Almost the entire movie was spent showing Harper neglecting Abbie and treating her like trash, even if it was out of fear of being rejected by her family, that’s not how you treat the person you love. I didn’t think Harper was on the same page as Abbie so it just didn’t seem like a good fit. Also, aside from the chemistry between Aubrey Plaza and Kristen Stewart, Riley was shown being there for Abbie and being supportive to her so it definitely seemed like there was something there.

I like that I can go to the movies and see a super ambitious and self-indulgent art-horror movie at the theater. This thing was all over the fucking place, but given the source material, I appreciate the madcap route they took. The original was style over substance, and it looks like that may've been the approach to everything, which gives it all a cobbled together dreamlike feel, even when nothing hinky is happening. Many of Argento's trademarks are there, from the focus on architecture to the use of funky SFX that appear more theatrical than cinematic. It also weirdly reminded me of one of my all-time favorites, Fulci's The Beyond, in its warped depiction of reality. Tilda Swinton's role(s) are nth degree weirdness, and that climax was Clive-Barker meets David Lynch. I'm still digesting it but, even for the slow parts, this is what I want to see.

62707,"As a pakistani and a former muslim of shia background (essentially kumails back ground), this was a pleasant surprise to watch. The inside jokes about shias are extra ordinary, and you'd probably not get them, or understand them if you even spot em. It was great to hear and see someone of a pakistani origin starring as a pakistani. I mean when do you get to see things like that, that often?

Here's where I think hollywood production designers took over, and fucked things up. It's likey not kumails fault, he doesn't control every aspect of the film, but the rest of the cast are head shaking, caricatured indians with huge indian accents. Not pakistani. I mean forget pakistani for a second, it was indian american actors doing what they THINK what old indian people sound like. anyway, what a disappointment there. It's like casting thick slavic accented bosnians, as americans, who eat swedish food, and have french culture... because all white people are the same right? In non kumail characters, the producers watered the shit out of pakistani culture, and in most cases eliminated it completely because either they don't know about basic facts, and don't WANT to know. kumail was probably too scared to speak up at the glaring horrendousness, or too busy to notice.

not only that, all the culture, the clothes, and shit, all indian. Who the fuck eats butter chicken in pakistan. i mean what the fuck is a butter chicken. also, and the characters speak hindi, not urdu. infact at one point, to prove to other characters, a woman says that she speak perfect urdu (supposedly in urdu).

59731,"A few things I wanted to add that weren't really addressed in other comments. 

I love that Disney really added this history of France as a character almost in itself. The ridiculous costumes, the dancing, the men wearing heels and makeup in the elites, the beast having lavish parties with the commoners money, etc. it all made for a much richer environment, to add to the comments others have made to the guillotine thing that Lumiere does. They never really addressed any of that in the animated one, it's kind of up to the viewer to just accept the tale that is given to you. Also, I really love the picture of contrast this paints between Belle and the average French young lady at the time (the bimbettes). It shows that belle isn't really the appearance that the beast would usually be a fan of either, or of what beast would be expected to marry (beast also made a comment about that when talking to his servants - her birth would be important to him, and adds another complexity to the curse. Obviously he couldn't just invite princesses over.) 

That kind of leads into one of my other favorite and unmentioned parts. I love the part that Agatha plays. The enchantress is the source of everything magic in the animated classic, yet she is only mentioned in the beginning. Here, Agatha almost seems to want the beast to win, as she manipulates the rules (and even may have caused the whole story to start, if she caused the lightning to hit the tree). She makes sure Maurice survives and seems to balance even the townspeople and their world. She lives as a ""hag"" which I thought was really clever. When she started climbing the stairs after the big battle I got really curious about her, and then she wordlessly resurrects the beast in the end, it showed her as a benevolent Demi-god that wanted the best for the beast. I love it because it really seems to fit that era's take on magic, and makes a fun little trope out of the hag/witch in the woods kind of thing. 

I agree with many of the other comments here, between the characters being well casted and Emma Watson clearly not having a strong singing voice (which, unlike phantom/Gerard butler in Phantom, isn't a critical plot point) and Gaston being absolutely perfect. LeFeu was actually a nuanced character, as well as Maurice. I like how they rewrote some parts and answered questions in others. 

It felt like a real world, fleshed out version of the animated classic. Perfect foil. ",0

As you said the rest of the team was chosen by the doctor possibly because of their self destructive tendencies or perhaps she unconsciously chose people similar to herself (dying and not wanting to return).

Obviously I'm generalizing but I don't really understand why this subreddit celebrates Aquaman and yet wants to shit on this movie when it's like a better, nerdier, weebier version of what Aquaman was trying to accomplish. 
There's lots of flaws in this movie like the clunky dialogue and overstuffed plotting plus the characters in general except for Alita are at best generic and at worst Hugo, but whenever Alita is in a scene doing whatever (especially when she's handing out beatdowns) this movie is such a blast.
That scene where she executes a one arm handstand into backflip and rams her fist into that dude's face. The Motorball scene where she pummels another dude with his own lopped off arm. When she rips through that room of security mechs. And peak anime goodness hits you when she literally splits her falling tear in two with her sword. If you can't unironically enjoy a flawed yet fun, energetic and inventive movie like this, I don't know who hurt you. 
I really hope we get a sequel, hopefully with better writing. And with more spectacular cyborg anime battles of course.

41836,"The amount of comments stating this movie implies suicide is a good thing is worrying.

Throughout the entire movie, we see Jackson struggle with heavy issues stemming from his childhood. Depression, alcoholism, drug abuse. He even attempted suicide as a teenager. So there is an obvious history that leads you to think this might be an ending for a drama film. That's not a statement on morality of suicide. The film neither says it's good or bad, just that people who deal with these issues sometimes choose to end their lives to end the suffering they are causing themselves and others.

What it does show is that for all of Jackson's intentions of making life easier for himself, his wife, and even Bobby, he fails. Why? Because his selfishness leads to them suffering for him even after his own suffering is done. They are sad and Ally is blaming herself, and Bobby even says this wasn't her fault or his own, but Jackson's, because he chose to do what he did. It doesn't necessarily condemn the act, but it shows that people who are so stuck in their own suffering can't see the harm they do to their loved ones.

Ally's last words in the song are that she'll never love again. Is that just something she feels at the moment or is it genuine and accurate? Only time will tell (well, nothing but your imagination since it's a work of fiction). But a guy killing himself and leaving a young woman whose life and ambitions were being fulfilled to believe she'll never love again doesn't seem to imply suicide is good.

The movie just shows that it happens. And people will eventually move on like Ally has by finally singing his song, but emotionally, there will always be a hole left in those who have been abandoned. Just because people didn't get the happy ending they didn't want, doesn't mean they should condemn a movie for giving a message it frankly didn't tell.

40367,"It's a serviceable movie but didn't really wow me. For context I don't know a lot about Queen so a lot of the info in the movie was new to me. 

After seeing how Bradley Cooper shot the concert scenes in A Star is Born, this movie's climactic concert felt like a letdown. It didn't have the dynamic or thrilling feeling of actually being in a concert to me. There were too many cuts to other people and other things during the scene that kept taking me out of it. One long shot of the concert, or even just staying with Freddy the entire concert and waiting until after the concert to shift to his parents, Mary, the volunteers, the crowd, etc would have probably been more powerful to me.

The movie in general also had a lot of the same flaws as Straight Outta Compton, in that it was obvious certain people's histories were being sanitized since they're still alive, while others got distorted to make the still-alive members look better. Making Freddie's arc be all about how the band was literally his family and he wasn't able to function without his family felt a bit patronizing and self-serving; to be fair I'm not a Queen expert so maybe that's legit, but it came off as the surviving members trying to act like they were innocent angels who rarely fought and only tried to pull Freddie away from a destructive lifestyle introduced to him by his shady ex boyfriend, when I'm sure that's not exactly how things happened.

Other parts of the movie felt like they just skipped from song origination to song origination really quickly. There was no natural showing of how any particular song came to be; they would literally show one person basically form 90% of the concept and then the song in concert. I guess the audience is expected to know the details but I didn't so I started checking out a little bit during these scenes.

One thing I will say is that Malek's performance alone is probably worth a watch. I really wish he had been put in a better version of this movie, because I think he could definitely pulled it off. As it is, he literally carries this movie from start to finish. So kudos to him, and I hope he gets nominated for his performance. ",1

It's not really that difficult of a movie to decipher, in my opinion, as the whole sleep deprivation angle serves a bumper lane to help the audience construe the metaphor. There are many things that we were shown is Susan's ""real life"" that were merely figments of her imagination.  Communication with Edward was one of those things.  I also do not think the daughter she called actually exists.  She was shown in a foggy/clouded frame, thereby insinuating she was some sort of dream or other vision (i.e. Susan may have been thinking of what she would be doing if she hadn't had the abortion, etc.).  

Assuming Edward is dead is far from a great assumption.  Everything in the book ran parallel to Susan's situation with him, and he died in the book.  He's dead, and it was by his own hand, with a large assist from Ray/Susan.

As for the dinner, it is something she is doing out of self-loathing.  Among the many emotions and mental states she experiences throughout the film, guilt is near the top of the hierarchy, and this dinner (along with remaining with her current husband and turning a blind eye to his overt affairs, as well as some of the art work she has chosen to display) are ways she punishes herself, mostly subconsciously.

He is probably a little harsh on Enola but that's only because she is continuing to disrespect him after everything her mother had done. He also genuinely believed she would be better off as a trained lady and respected the woman who ran the school (who herself also genuinely believed she was helping Enola).

As for his intelligence, we don't really see him in his own field of speciality. He basically runs the government from behind the scenes and we can obviously see he is well-informed on politics.

I enjoyed Gaga, Drivers, and Pacino’s acting. 

However I didn’t enjoy the long runtime. Along with the poor editing made the passage of time and narrative so confusing. One scene they’re living it up in their NYC penthouse, very next scene their in Italy and it’s the 90’s? Why did Driver’s characters house get raided? And he escaped to Switzerland, then came back like nothing happened.

The ending left me wanting so much more as well. I wanted to see what led up to her getting caught, the emotions and drama behind that could’ve been a grand slam final act.",0

He does this right after his mother calls him to dinner, saying ""Elio"".

I didn't get that motivation at all. Why did it have to be Melanie starting this new cult? Why couldn't Bee just pick the worst bully or something?

IMO, the ending is supposed to highlight how alone and outcasted Chiron is from society. So much so that he became someone he's not just to ""fit in."" The film isn't trying to make us feel good. It wants us to leave and dwell on how Chiron has dealt with being different.

Most stage adaptations are terrible. They're usually the main characters talking in a room while the camera sort of just swivels around.

This movie though is a notable exception and a welcome departure. Not just because of the scenes that don't take place in the room, but because of how the plot stays dynamic. They go to the roof at one point. Cooke and Ali make that detour to the liquor store, etc. This is how you do it. Phenomenal movie. Odom's monologue about the Rolling Stones is such a brilliant fuck you to Malcolm. Incredible all around. The Boston Concert is probably my favorite scene of the year. also I had no idea Cookie died IRL 10 months later. Surprised they didn't include a note about that.

It also managed to be the funniest of the Avenger movies without the humor undercutting the stakes as in some of the other comedic movies. You can definitely tell Gunn had input on the Guardians and Waititi had input on Thor and probably also Banner.

In Toy Story 2, the 40 seconds of them driving a car is short enough for them to fill it with jokes, and progress the story. In Finding Dory, they spend five or ten minutes having it drag on with too little jokes that last too long. They get stuck in a roundabout, they drive on the wrong side of traffic, they cross a median, the cops show up, and they end up careening over the edge of a cliff. In Toy Story 2, the characters all do their thing for a little bit, and then it just cuts to the airport. Much better pacing.",0
58064,"Yeah, it was more character driven than I expected, which is great because Power Rangers has always been at its best (In Space simply due to how many years of interconnected drama was finishing, Time Force, especially RPM) when it is a character drama where the characters actually grow and are visibly more than just one hobby one note teenagers who get powers.

In fact, if I had only one complaint it would be that this movie series is going to be based on the Zordon era. I love the Zordon era...a lot...I may or may not have some of the suits IRL...but an RPM style movie would have been god tier.

Unfortunately, there's a huge set of people who have seen MMPR (and maybe Zeo/Turbo/In Space) but aren't aware of how good RPM actually is so it probably wouldn't have done as well since it can't pull the nostalgia strings. RPM was the most un-Power Rangers like season (They were very very close to getting a TV-PG over the series standard of TV-Y7) and completely unmatched when it comes to story, character development, and creating emotion. Also unmatched in acting talent, every single Power Ranger in that show became an actual repeat actor with almost all of them in relatively popular stuff. Also unmatched in unmorphed fight scene choreography.

Best part of the Twitch marathon going on right now for me was watching people who haven't seen it before going from dread (2 of the 3 seasons prior to RPM are...well, 2 of the 3 worst series in the entire shows history) to such complete enthrallment that chat actually slowed down because people were enjoying the show and there wasn't too much to meme about beyond Kreygasming at the villain girl and BILLIONS ACTUALLY DEAD.

58228,"This film was quite enjoyable to me. 


Score and musical numbers all wonderful and expertly shot (the director did previously work in music videos so I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise.)


Jackman is wonderful, Zendaya is wonderful, Efron is wonderful, Rebecca Ferguson is passable (although don't miss that her singing is not her - it's Voice finalist Loren Allred). Michelle Williams is sweet enough, though she seemed uncomfortable and out of place at times.


The biggest issue for me (and it didn't ruin the movie) is that the subject matter is not correct. Barnum was no wide-eyed dreamer who longed to shelter and nurture the misunderstood. He was a conman who would do anything to make a buck, at the expense of people with genetic deformities and animals. The issue for the viewer is choosing whether or not to reconcile movie Barnum with real-life Barnum.

Altogether, the wisest decision this movie should've made would've been to make this movie about someone else- a fictional showman. That way the ties to Barnum for the viewer could be cut. And let's be real, here - the movie would've been just as memorable without all those ridiculously CGI animals (whose only purpose was to heighten an already-mind-numbing spectacle and, ironically, remind the viewers that Barnum was a monster to animals.)

A solid B- of a film - worth a popcorn watch and I'd probably buy it on DVD.",0

Oh definitely. The tragic thing about WW1 was that no one realized how awful these new weapons were, and were so distraught in fighting against them that they resorted to building huge trenches and sit in them for years just to wait it out.

WW1 was a horrible, horrible affair that was grimy and dirty. WW2 had a cinematic enemy, and is what I consider to be the age of heroes for our time; it was still horrendous and apocalyptic, but they were fighting to save the world (the Allies did commit atrocities as well, and they are glossed over in mediums that cover the era as you stated) In WW1, no one knew why they were fighting like you said, just that they were told to shoot Germans and Ottomans and Britons and French and Austro-Hungarians because of what a bunch of guys in offices decided.",0

Every group knows that there are lots of hwhites who are intentionally in denial, often by hwhites who are all too aware of their privileges and are petrified of losing it. 

The film showcased a great portrayal of the Black group still fighting to earn the right to walk down the street without fear of harm or death towards themselves and their loved ones from the public servants meant to protect one and all, against the hwhite group with hatred in their hearts, the hwhite group s still yearning for the days of slavery; willing to go to the extent of great harm and kill every other demographic that contributed to building the nation. 

Living in a world in the year 2018 and being ruled by a president who actively enables racist hate groups. A world where hwhites reap the benefits of slavery and still continue to have more opportunities than any other demographic, even greater than the indigenous natives could ever hope for, but still crying fragile tears of being hard done by; while stating everyone else should remain silent for complaining about being oppressed. 

The only people who will find these film uncomfortable are those with the same hwhite fragility mindset.

The best I believe was Haley Joel Osment. Though I completely believe that he was being given something or had some sort of disease that makes him look like a kid for much longer than he should.

If it was more accurate it would be a documentary. But ""based on a true story"" typically just means taking an idea and doing something original with it while maintaining the overall sentiment of it.

You have to leave a lot of room on the table for the writers to be creative and make up a bunch of stuff that they want to express.

It's a version of the Just World fallacy. It's like we need to believe that the survivors did something special, or were inherently special, and that's why they lived, because otherwise we'd have to confront the awful truth that every Holocaust survivor has ever tried to tell us; there's not necessarily anything special or meaningful in who lives or who dies.

I hope we never forget these globe-spanning, generation-shattering (and defining) conflicts that so shaped the world we live in today-and more importantly, the people that fought in them.

In a medium sized-city, only about a quarter of the theater was filled. The only other small theater that showed the film in the city was fully booked. The only screening available was a 3D one, which wasn't too special, but given that it's unlikely I'll ever get my hands on a 3D version of this film on home media, it was worth the extra money. 

Little needs to be said about the astounding restoration of century-old footage to something that feels very real, limited only by how 'restorable' the source material was. For most audiences at least, the quality and production value and effort speak for themselves. 

The exclusive use of recordings of soldiers to serve as the film's narration is particularly what makes this film so unique for me. Although the soldiers interviewed may have been old when their voices were recorded by the BBC in the 1960s, their sole presence as the voices of this film adds yet another level of immersion and historicity that is provided by the restored footage.

The format of the film as a first-person social history is very effective, and one that I think is rather unique and novel among historical (war) documentaries. I am not referring to the technical aspects here; it would be foolish for one to expect someone to find enough quality audiovisual footage from say, the Civil War and make a documentary about that. The documentaries that I remember watching usually have a mixture of audio and visual re-enactments combined with maybe video interviews of veterans that might cut into a narration over a still photo or film footage. These documentaries are fine, but they cannot quite engage the audience so effectively. Then there are historical biopics, but they are more distant from the historical source and quite often bend or stretch the historical truth in the name of artistic license or entertainment. These are also fine, and entertaining, but can vary in their historical and educational value.

We have lots of contemporary footage and audio interviews from more modern conflicts to hypothetically make a film in the same format, whether it be WWII, or Afghanistan. I think there is something special about this film, however, given how extremely distant the world of WWI was compared to other conflicts where audiovisual footage exists. My grandfather was born near the end of the war-that's how long ago this conflict was! For me, it is the bringing to life of such a distant period of time, through the perspective of soldiers who were there, and restored footage, as opposed say, a reenactment, that makes this film stand out for me compared to other war documentaries. 

I wish this kind of documentary was around when I was a high school history student. It would have made a lot more people interested in studying history, something I firmly believe all of us should have a greater knowledge and awareness of. ",0
65616,"That two nightmare sequences really got to me. The first time we saw Paula shouting, the director chose to silent her voice when she shouted, then she walked into her room. Her room was lit with red/pink lighting... *Oh Roxanne(Paula), you don't have to put on the red light*. We kinda have an idea when she had that new hairdo and she had a man over when Little came back home from swimming with Juan... The after school bullying scene where the bully went to Chiron's home confirmed that Paula was involved in prostitution to pay for her drug addiction. 

The second time the nightmare scene came around we finally heard what her mother said when she shouted... She used the phrase ""don't look at me"". She was ashamed of what she's doing, she didn't want Chiron to see what she's doing, she vented her own shame on him, yet that childhood memory haunted poor Little forever since. 

I'm not sure of the symbolism of the flashing blue and red light before both nightmare sequence though... On one hand they looked like police siren lights, on the other hand it flashed blue before act two, and it flashed red before act three. My theory is blue is innocence as teen Chiron and red is innocence destroyed as adult drug dealer Chiron, but I'm not sure. Anyone has any ideas?

Messages related to PTSD, racism in America, and corruption felt kind of rammed together and as a result very muddled- as individual subjects they work well, but when put together in this film everything feels cheapened. I can see where they were trying to go but I felt as if they never quite got there (I DO think this is a powerful film, though). Also, I felt like the pacing/tone was kind of a mess- there were a lot of points where I didn't know how  I was supposed to feel about a certain situation, some parts that went on for too long, and some parts that just felt skimmed over.

73552,"Here's a review I posted on this sub but it didn't get traction maybe you guys might like it.

I really liked this movie. I'd compare it to The Night Before that released last year. Has pretty funny jokes and a couple of running jokes that aren't overdone. It feels like a mixture of The Night Before and Horrible Bosses but cranked up a couple notches.

This isn't a politically correct movie. You will see genitals, deep throating, mentions of incest, 3D printing of genitals, weird fetishes of people, and much more. All the characters get enough screen time and have their storyline finished by the end of the movie.

The jokes in the trailer are about half of the jokes in the movie but there's still plenty of other good jokes that aren't in the trailer. The relationship between Jennifer Aniston's and TJ Miller's characters felt genuine as any other relationship in real life would. The movie wasn't 100% predictable which I liked but the storyline came in a definite second compared to how characters communicated with each other and how they went through the movie.

Although the story mainly revolved around Bateman's, Miller's, Munn's, and Aniston's characters, Kate McKinnon definitely was also a shining star in the movie. Even though she was a tertiary character, Bateman and Miller being primary and Aniston and Munn being secondary, the way she performed made her a secondary character and by the end of the movie was pretty much a secondary character. Most of the other characters had their own stories going on that didn't mix with the main storyline other than that they wanted to keep their job. Although Aniston's character looks to be the only antagonist, there is another antagonist in the movie that pops up later on which I won't spoil. If you were going into this movie hoping for some secret cameos then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed as almost all if not all the characters have already been introduced in the trailers.

Overall this was a funny movie that I'll definitely watch again but for some of you might warrant more of a RedBox or streaming viewing instead. The movie definitely pushes a hard R rating and definitely couldn't have been a PG-13 without some major changes to the comedy although the storyline wouldn't need any changes as it's a basic cookie cutter plot with a couple of twists. I'll say go see this movie more for the comedy and interactions rather than the plot. A solid B+ movie.",0

28969,">In the scene where Laurie reveals to Jo that he married Amy, she asks if he loves her. It couldn't be more obvious that the answer is not an enthusiastic yes. He hasn't fallen head-over-heels for Amy. He likes her, but more importantly, he always wanted to be a March, envious of how close and loving the family is, something he never had. Jo rejected him, Meg was never an option, Beth was dead. Amy was a fine settle.  
>  
>Laurie married Amy, not because he loves her passionately, but because he wanted to be loved. He knew she loved him.

If that's how they played it it's a rewrite, since Laurie clearly loves Amy in the book. Of course he's not going to come home and rhapsodize since he knows Jo has had a hard time, but Jo notices he keeps saying ""My wife"" because he loves to say it, and his face turns ""rapturous"" when he hears Amy's voice. In Europe, Laurie tries to write an opera using Jo as inspiration but he keeps failing because he keeps having fantasies of Amy instead.  There's a comical passage over Laurie's struggle and determination (in Europe) to keep his love for Jo ALIVE, because it keeps dying and he keeps seeing her in provoking, unromantic scenarios in his head instead of the deathless romantic tragedy he imagined he'd be living forever. He even tells Jo he thinks he would have been sorted out naturally (Jo as sister, Amy as wife) if he'd given himself time.   In Europe he gets so annoyed at how he's not keeping the flame alive that he writes once again to Jo, figuring that will do it, but she knocks him flat again.

Greta Gerwig actually says the difference between Jo/Laurie and Amy/Laurie IS passion. That clearly Amy/Laurie want to fuck. Whereas that's not what Jo and Laurie are about.

Laurie's initial emotional confusion makes sense. He grew up motherless, without feminine influence. Jo became this ideal - a sister, a girl, a best buddy. It's a ""romantic friendship"" in the classical Victorian sense (chaste, but emotionally intimate and inspiring). He also wants to be part of the family, AND he's ready to be in a relationship, period (I think) while Jo is not. Laurie is for her part of the idealized family of origin she never wanted to alter.

""Always wanted to be a March"" was a conceit of the 1994 film, but not in the book.  However, it's clear (as in Austen) that for Alcott the ideal romantic relationship has the couple as dear friends as well as lovers, and that would have been a tough one to pull off in Little Women if Laurie hadn't married a March. Another issue, IMO, is both Jo and Meg sort of hero worship the men they marry. Bhaer is like Jo's mother and three sisters all bundled into one. He's has so much personal warmth he can heat an entire house, he's an intellect, well read way beyond where Jo is, he's older, far more educated, and blah blah including cuddly, generous, kind and smart. He's where Jo aspires to be. And of course John Brook the tutor is so so patient with young young Meg. So it's left to Amy who actually has a marriage with an equal, which may be another reason some readers/fans think Amy unfairly made out the best. She's the only one not being tutored in life at the knee of her husband. It's more like vice versa.

PS - when you read Little Women, IF Amy has a crush on Laurie, it's very subtle and I'm not sure intentional by Alcott. It's most clear in one line.  Young Amy says something like, ""Laurie is a remarkable boy and can't be compared to regular boys."" when she expresses an opinion about boys and Jo or another sister tell her, ""But Laurie..""",1

68266,"I agree! I hated the ending, because it painted a picture of how much better life would have been if they had stayed together. You spent the entire film being romantic and building up the relationship between these two, only to shatter it. 
I'm just not sure why such a movie based in fantasy and whimsy would have such a cynical conclusion. It seems wrong to show the audience the ending they've been rooting for only to rip it away and say, in classic Wayne's World fashion, ""NOT!""

**I'm going to discuss the endings of Good Will Hunting, Annie Hall, 500 Days of Summer, and When Harry Met Sally. If you haven't seen them, beware of spoilers.**

I don't buy the, ""Well, that's what real life is like."" Especially not for this movie! The whole thing was a fantasy. Would Good Will Hunting have been better if at the end Will took the job, didn't go after Skyler, since that's how things would go in real life?

At the end of Annie Hall it's bittersweet, but you're not crushed that Annie and Alvy aren't together. You get the feeling that they've both moved on with their lives, and they're better people because of their time together, but they're not devastated imagining the life that they could have lived.

Even in 500 Days of Summer you understand that they were never really meant for each other. He was selfish, and he didn't realize that.

I would have much preferred something like When Harry Met Sally, which is on the surface, a much more cynical film than La La Land. But when Billy Crystal runs into the party and says 'When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible' it reenforces the fact that these two should be together.

Frank was never treated as any sort of hero, or even as the sort of person who could have a noble change of heart; that’s just not the story that’s being told.

When Jimmy gets in that car, you know he’s going to his death, and yet it’s still no less shocking when it comes, because the physical act itself is so violent and so sudden; it’s over in an instant, and this man who Frank was so close to is dead. No honor, no dignity, no ceremony.",1

The buzz will lead you to believe this is some masterpiece. But I found it definitively mediocre.
Performances are fine. Cinematography is okay, nothing special. The story is light, and characterization leaves much to be desired. Honestly I didn't care about anyone except the Indian dude.

48968,"I didn't know anything about this movie going in. Didn't know the story or the plot and had seen one trailer months ago that I barely remember.

After the movie started and all the characters had been introduced I thought the set up was going to be that each character had learned about the buried money through different circumstances and each character was there to take the moeny for themselves. After the hidden hallway scene with Jon Hamm it became clear that was not the set up or plot of the movie at all.

I thought, ""okay that's fine. Where is this going?"" and then it didn't go anywhere. Just 4 seperate stories converging into one bad night at one location. There didn't really seem to be any point to what or why any of it was happening. Just things happening and all the interesting qualities led to nothing. Even the most obvious comparison to the Hatful 8, and by extension John Carpenters The Thing, I thought okay maybe this film is about paranoia. But it doesn't even go that far. Sure its there and every character exhibits some degree of paranoia but I wouldn't go as far to say the movie was about that. 

Disappointed over all by the lack of point but the movie is not terrible. Great technical qualities, production design, costume design, excellent cinematography and of course a great cast that each deliver solid performances.

It seems like Alana is stuck in a rut and struggling with adulthood, and hanging out with Gary is a way for her to reclaim that youthful, carefree feeling that she no longer has. But she's clearly torn about it. Throughout the movie, she questions why she's hanging out with Gary and his friends instead of growing up. After the running out of gas sequence, she seems fed up with how immature Gary is and wants to make a change. She starts working in Sachs' office, and her relationship with Gary changes noticeably - she starts getting annoyed at him for messing up tasks and for not thinking about the bigger picture beyond himself and his friends. This continues up until the scene where Sachs invites her for a drink, only to reveal that she is being used as a cover. Once Alana is reminded of how bleak and horrible the adult world can be, her first reaction is to go find Gary again.  

I think there's a lot of interesting material in her character dealing with perspectives on aging/adulthood/responsibility.",1

I quite liked this about her.

I'm glad there were so many aspects to Judy's personality. Of course there were some tropes, but all characters have them, and her's were done nicely. I think it's one reason characters like her and Nick felt so real.

I did really like this movie. I can see why it didn't win Best Picture though cause there were some weird plot holes and the ending was a little rushed.

Alexander Desplat's score is whimsical and swells with love, along with some of the songs del Toro chose for the soundtrack. In particular, the dance sequence is an emotional high point thanks to the use of ""You'll Never Know,"" despite the absurdity of a woman dancing with a man-fish.

Guillermo del Toro's conscious attention to the movie's color palette makes The Shape of Water one of the most beautifully shot movies of the year. The palette predominantly green and aqua, as del Toro chose those colors to represent the land, sea, and their union when the relationship develops. 

Overall, The Shape of Water is among my favourite movies of the year and will be a serious Oscar contender.

Some side notes, this was one of the coolest screenings I've been to since the theater I was in was the same one below Elisa's apartment, so it felt rather surreal watching the theater I was in.

He mentioned the significance of the use of color, how the creature was 95% practical, and how he was surprised he was able to pull the movie off on a $19 million budget. Another thing though, del Toro won't be recording a commentary for this since he believes the movie speaks for itself.",1

55388,"This is one of Meryl Streep's best performances in a while, but on the whole, The Post is just alright. Meryl Streep has a great performance and her arc, going from a well-connected socialite who stumbled into owning the paper and lacks confidence in the face of a male-dominated social order to someone willing to put everything on the line for the sake of the integrity of the Post and the press in general, is strong. Heck, I also really liked most of the rest of the cast, especially Bob Odenkirk. The problem is the script in most other respects is pretty weak: the first hour absolutely crawls, the dialogue is mediocre and outside of Streep's Kay Graham, none of the characters are particularly interesting. Hank's is probably the most disappointing performance, as he basically just scrunches his face and has a gravely voice as ""generic gruff newspaperman"" and doesn't have a patch on Jason Robard's performance of Ben Bradlee in All the President's Men. Finally, for all the star power not in front of the camera, this is the least inspired work from Janusz Kaminski or John Williams that I can remember. 

Meryl Streep's performance and character are enough to make up for a lot of the shortcomings, but The Post can't get past an extremely clunky start and a flawed script. In ranking Spielberg's informal series of ""American ideals tested"" movies, it's definitely behind Lincoln and about the same level as Bridge of Spies and Amistad.",1

As a straight dude, I was so moved by the realness of their romance and how they were conflicted between girls and being gay. I thought Luca Guadagnino did a terrific job balancing the two. He just did a great job overall.

My only complaint has nothing to do with the film itself but with the fucking audience who got up right as the credits started rolling and didn’t give the film time to end and absorb the emotions. Lots of ignorant teens in the audience who don’t respect movies enough as an artform and are too addicted to their phones and therefore cant wait for a film to end.

60221,"The editing/music is low hanging fruit so I want to geek out on the script. Edgar Wright really understands how to tell a story through the medium. Every single beat of the movie felt like it had an introduction, a link and a payoff. I have not seen a movie so tightly wrapped in so many years. There was nothing left wanting.

Something as innocuous as the Monsters Inc line was set up with the television in act one, had the joke set-up by the nephew being in act two and then hit with Spacey's line in act three. The stolen line itself was used three times in the movie to, introduced via Mike/Sully, used by Baby and paid off in the final confrontation.

They set up the Baby's foster father grabbing the stereo to listen which helped relieve the absolute SADNESS I felt when Deborah commented on his mother's singing voice and we couldn't hear it.

The humming effect was so jarring, especially during the Peachtree Centre Mall scene and just brought me to Baby's level of anxiety, I've never felt so in tune with a protagonist before.

Jamie Foxx was incredible, the car cherography was great and I need to see it again and again for that first 20 minutes and all the visual incredible work it put forward.

Wish Wright had better cameras though, the night and interior shots were so full of noise from lack of light. I guess that is the limitations of a $40m budget.",0

18497,"Is the ""love"" talk really that unrealistic, especially for the era?  I feel like people in those times would write love poetry just based on the site of a pretty maiden at the market.

Add in her impending marriage, and I could believe they fell for each other quickly.

I don't disagree that elements were forced or predictable. For me, I thought that having abortive medicinal herbs, an abortion, a witchy bonfire, the birth and death of a full relationship, paintings, psychadelic drugs... all within a 5 day parental absence seemed like a stretch. Also, an almost utopian wish fulfillment of modern day feminism. I didn't *totally* buy it.

Still, I bought it well enough, and I quite liked the movie. Tense, hot, amazing end, interesting setting.

Why killing him was just as good (or better?) than swapping his phone makes no sense, I think he always intended to kill the man with her there, again so he could manipulate her into whore school.

45935,"I really liked the film. A solid 8/10. I would say it is Jennifer Lawrence's best movie since Days of Future Past. It was good to see a grounded spy movie for once that actually focuses on the spy-ish aspect rather than the over the top action we find in most spy movies.

The best part was the story. Unpredictable, suspenseful and was developed well. I also liked how Dominca transitioned into a spy. I think Lawrence and Egerton were terrific. J Law did a nice job with the accent. But the supporting cast of British actors were terrible even though i like many of them. The actor playing Ivan the uncle was also in good form. 

Production design was excellent. The costumes and sets gave this movie and elegant feel. James Howard's score is another plus and goes really well with the tone of the film.

Overall, I felt it was a pleasant surprise and it is disappointing to see it get poor response from the critics and the audience. The movie cost 70m and has made 145m, so double its budget. Despite the bad reviews and word of mouth its impressive that it made that much. Seems like J Law still is a solid draw.",0

54763,"Just saw the movie and I was very impressed. I still can't get the score out of my head.

Obviously the film is about the relationship between Woodcock and Alma, but I also thought it worked well as an allegory for the cycle of creativity. At the beginning of the story, Alma becomes Woodcock's muse and inspiration. He even mentioned to her that he's been waiting for her for a very long time. He's been waiting for somebody to come along and ignite his passion. She makes him hungry for it.

Then eventually things become stale and his creative drive begins to dissipate. He becomes extremely frustrated/ disinterested with Alma. A lot of creative types find it difficult to produce at times in their lives when they are complacent. He was always trying to fill a hole with his work and once that hole had been filled by somebody else, his work began to suffer for it.

In his past relationships he would simply end things so that he could be alone again and keep filling that hole with his craft. Then he finds a new muse and the cycle repeats.

When Alma decides to poison him, she allows him to purge that complacency. He is facing death and uncertainty and that hole that was filled is emptied. And Alma is there after the reset button has been pressed. He is hungry again. Rinse, lather, repeat.

These are just thoughts that were running through my head on my drive home and I could be completely off base. Either way, fantastic movie. PTA gone and done it again",1

Casey's character struggles to make sense of a world where the only attachment that actually matters has been ripped apart.

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs: Tim Blake Nelson as Buster Scruggs was fantastic. Loved every second of it.

Near Algodones: Short and funny. I wonder if Stephen Root got the job due to him playing Milton in Office Space. I immediately thought they were similar.

Meal Ticket: Damn! I'm still thinking about that chapter. Where did they first team up? Were they good friends once or was Impresario always just after the money from the start? Harry Melling's performance was amazing, especially when he realized what was about to happen.

All Gold Canyon: Stunning scenery and great performance by Tom Waits. Damn you Coen brothers for tricking us.

It reminded me a lot of Denzel in Fences, where sure the actor is doing a good job with that character but that dude only does so much before you get tired of his attitude.  


And it definitely feels like we are missing some aspects of his life, like when Brandy brings up that he had a son from another woman? Yeah, that gets shoved aside.   


It’s a very standard, straightforward biopic that looks good and has nice performances. But I don’t think this is a real standout compared to any of the other awards contenders this year. And I definitely think Will Smith is not the best performance I’ve seen this year from an actor.",1

20950,"I understand everything Spike Lee wanna says for black people throughout the film, and Vietnam is only the background for the whole story. But as a Vietnamese, that background is very wrong, unrealistic, illogical, and shows that his crew was too lazy and did not do enough research about Vietnam.

The bar scene is cliche. Apocalypse is a real bar, and disabled kid like in the film is unlikely to get inside. Why is he disabled though? Because of the war? He was born in the XXI century. And how the hell can he get firecrackers? They are banned here for years. A beggar like him can afford firecrackers just to throw them at random foreign guys? That scene is bullshit, though I understand Lee wanna portrays their trauma.

Before that a little bit, the cheers scene is cliche. We did that in many propaganda films. So it may be big for Americans, but not so much to Viet. It feels even forced. We moved on.

To the floating market, why trying to sell chickens to tourists? That is laughable. How did he know these characters were GI? Once again, it was very, very forced and unrealistic. We moved on from this phase long ago and do not bear hatred towards Americans.

Vietnamese in the film are stereotypes. Who are these guys with rifle in the jungle? Cops, military, ex-military? No. Stereotype villains? Yes. I doubt that the government allow people to run around with guns like that, especially involving foreign people (I am talking about these French). You would say they paid under-table money to get into the jungle, and acquire some stupid paper showing at the beginning. No! If the government knows about the area, with these gunners running around, these four guys would never be allowed inside, even with a lot of money. 

You can say what you want, but the Vietnam background in the movie shows that Americans hasn’t moved on and still keeps a lot of prejudice towards the country. I appreciate the messages for black people. But other than that, it is a failure.

Technically, my main issue was the soundtrack. During the most emotional scene (and throughout the movie) the organ music took me out of the moment. 

Additionally, I think a better movie would have ""implied"" more than literally showing the dead children's body bags. I think showing the house in fire, Michelle getting held back by firemen, then cut to the confession at the police dept, with maybe a lightning fast flashback of the fire again would have been more subtle.

I did like Michelle Williams and the actor who played Patrick, as well as the narrative structure with selective flashbacks. Casey Affleck was a little one-note for me.

Then we see this brief moment in Tex's face, where he realizes his own attempts to appear unhinged and crazy, as a means to strike fear in others while pointing a gun, is being outmatched by a guy laughing at him while holding a can of dog food and pointing a finger gun.

Tex escalates his own laughter in a very brief ""psycho laugh battle"" only to be defeated.

67473,"Depends on the well. (Just using very general numbers for example, all leases and wells vary...) Let's say a well produces 100 bbl/day. Let's say $50/bbl is the current value of oil (a few years ago it was $100+/bbl). That's $5,000/day revenue. 30 days a month equals $150,000/mo revenue. Now that revenue is split between the lessee and lessor. Typical oil lease is for about 1/8 to 1/4 royalty. Let's say 1/5 or 20% for our example. $150,000/mo x 20% = $30,000/mo in royalty. Now that's just one well. And that's assuming only 100 bbl/day and only $50/bbl oil prices. A brand new well in the Permian could be around that number. These are just rough estimate numbers, but I think the figure in the movie is reasonable.  ",1
15611,"The point being made is that Hampton, unlike most other revolutionaries after the civil rights movement, made the focus on class instead of race. This uniquely separated him from black power/black nationalist movements before and during his time. 

Explicitly, this is seen not only in quotes that were in the movie such as, ""We're going to fight racism not with racism, but we're going to fight with solidarity. We say we're not going to fight capitalism with black capitalism, but we're going to fight it with socialism."" but the entire segment and real-life portion of the Rainbow Coalition that shows his interaction with working and poor white Southerners of the Young Patriots who even brandish Confederate flags and who sign on the Rainbow Coalition.

This ability to unite Chicago's proles and lumpen, which represents minute differences (moreso then than now) in material conditions along identity groups compared to the massive difference in the capital-owning & protecting classes to themselves, is what made Hampton especially threatening to the intelligence agencies and what created the ""Messiah"" image that they feared.

So yes, the primary aspect of Hampton that made him such a threat to the upper classes and their apparatus of force was his class-focused rhetoric and unification.",1

18491,"I’m late to the party, and despite loving it, I can see where you’re coming from. 

I think perhaps part of the reason it clicked for me was that many of the things you pointed out are, in my mind, pieces of a much larger puzzle, each working together to further the narrative. That is, each fragmented theme you mentioned can be linked by what I believe the film is truly about: the female experience. Abortions, involuntary pregnancies, rape, discrimination, these were all things experienced by and dealt with solely by women. If the film doesn’t dedicate significant time to one of these elements, that is only because it takes it in stride, as women of that time would have.

Marianne is forbidden to paint the male figure, so she paints the abortion scene. She paints what is known only to women, that will be seen only by women. There is something powerful about that. 

The pendant is a token of their love, but Heloise acknowledges that the image will only remind Marianne of Heloise. The concept that a painting only has true life and warmth when there is a certain level of understanding between the subject and artist is established, but it’s made clear that a painting can only be a weak substitute for a person. Thus the pendant is both significant, yet inadequate. 

The visions Marianne has of Heloise in the dress to me symbolize the knowledge that their time together is short, that Heloise will wear a wedding dress as she steps into the abyss, and away from Marianne. It haunts her. 

Finally, while Heloise’s sexuality is uncertain, I think Marianne’s is known. When Heloise says “you cannot understand me because you have a choice” Marianne responds “I understand you”, or something to that effect. In my eyes, Marianne is admitting that she cannot, and will not marry, as she cannot marry whom she wishes, suggesting that she is gay. 

I’m curious to hear your thoughts on what I’ve said, I found your comment insightful, and contrary to my observations, and thus extremely interesting",0

The story itself was beautifully constructed, I felt like the slower pace and limited dialogue added so much to the story.  I still have to take more time to fully process, but I was deeply moved by the portrayal of friendship, love, heartbreak.  Seeing the 28 in the portrait in the gallery definitely opened up the tears for me, and the final scene in the theater broke open the dam.  I think that Héloïse didn't see Marianne, but through the music, she felt Marianne still with her.  That definitely struck a deep cord, bringing back memories of people since gone from my life.  Huge props to Adèle and Noémie for those stunning performances as well.

That's depressing in two ways. 

1) Night Howler psychosis might have been a known trauma but no medical advances were done until after the issue was sensationalized.

2) The small hick town is so detached from modern society/the big city that their issues aren't even on the world's radar and visa-versa.

The fact that she had a special connection to Sacramento was kinda a major plot point, and not one that was very subtle. And yes she spent a long time trashing Sacramento in the movie, but she's a rebellious teenager... teenagers say that about wherever they grow up. A large part of this movie was a really in depth examination of what that really means, and people's connection to where they grow up.

61730,"It was very good, I’ve read the book and seen the original many times so it wasn’t about the whodunit for me, I was just observing the movie and experiencing it for what it was. The acting was amazing, as was expected. Sometimes the lighting outside was a little warm and soft which gave a lot of the environments a fake feel, along with the fact that when they were outside in the snow there wasn’t snow in their faces or hair or any real signs of being cold which made it feel like they were just in front of a green screen which they probably were but I would’ve liked more effort in making it feel real. For a movie where most of the people watching it probably know the ending, these things are crucial for it to just be an art piece and I mean for the rest of the movie it was amazing and I didn’t hate the soft lighting outside, it did give it a cinematic feel which I think they were going for. The camera angles were strange sometimes but just because they were strange doesn’t mean they were bad at all, they were actually quite extraordinary and only ever added to the movie and I think they were pretty perfect, albeit a little unconventional. 

Overall an enjoyable experience; this story is always great to experience. Kenneth’s take as Poirot was very good, but of course it is because he is a fantastic actor and I want to see another rendition of a different adventure with him as the character.",0

26229,"I’m seeing a lot of back and forth about why Kim stabs Mr. Park at the end. My interpretation is that he just decided he wouldn’t stand for Park’s disdain for him and his family any longer.

The Parks are never really shown to do anything that is objectively evil or anything. Their condition is just juxtaposed throughout the film against the Kims’, who have nothing. They live in comfort, oblivious to the plight of the poor. They’re so blind to the poor that they don’t even notice they essentially have squatters in their house. Meanwhile, the Kims live underground, and all their efforts are essentially in pursuit of...work.

The work doesn’t get them out of their condition. They’re essentially risking everything to live in servitude. When the Parks come back early from camping, it never occurs to the Kims or Geun-se and his wife to band together and take the Kims’ house or something— they start scrambling to get back to work and keep the Parks’ favor.

When Kims daughter is stabbed and Parks son passes out (and presumably has a seizure?), Park asks for the keys. Kim doesn’t even think twice; he gives him the keys because Park is his boss. Meanwhile, his family is in danger and his children are bleeding out. When Park covers his nose from the smell of Geun-se, he remembers just how Park and his family feel about the Kims. They consider the Kims beneath them, almost like stinkbugs. This is what drives Kim to take out Mr. Park. It’s not because Park really did anything wrong, it’s just that nothing will ever give Kim and his family what they need. No matter how hard they try, they will always be “beneath” the Parks, and so he stabs him in a fit of rage and hides last second in the bunker.",1

24522,"She didn't want to recruit anyone. She wanted to free Cole, and by extension Phoebe. 

Bee was just a normal babysitter until the accident, then she sells her soul to the devil specifically to save Phoebe. At this point the devil gives her the book and instructs her to start a blood cult, so they could perform the ritual in the book. She is told to offer them 'their hearts desire' to get them to make the deal. 

She goes around recruiting, as we see in flashbacks, and then they start doing the devils bidding, making sacrifices and using the blood of the innocent. 

She gets sucked into the world, the power is so intoxicating she eventually loses herself to it, becoming who we see in the first one. Someone strong instead of weak etc. But in the process of leading this cult she forms a bond with Cole, as she has to protect him since he is 'top shelf' innocent blood. On the night he kills her she is changed, she 'snaps out of it' so to speak and is no longer intoxicated by the power being offered by the devil. She decides her goal from here on is to free Cole no matter the cost. 

She has to wait 2 years, per the ritual. 

The devil has her assemble a new cult, as the old one failed, but Bee ultimately drags her feet on this, allowing Melanie to take the reigns specifically to set the plan in motion. 

Melanie has no desire to be more than friends with Cole, Bee knows this and she also knows that Cole is so hung up on Melanie that he won't even think about Phoebe, like that, unless something happens to Mel.

She knows Phoebe is the type of girl to find Cole's quirkiness alluring, she knows that under the right conditions, Cole and Phoebe could be perfect for each other. So she does what she has to to get them both in the same area. 

She primes Phoebe with the bunny and the note. 

All of this is done specifically to get Cole laid, as after that he won't be 'innocent'. 

Bee couldn't be sure it would happen, too many variables etc, but she hoped her plan would work. You can see the slight grin on her face as she watches her crew drink. She knows both Cole and Phoebe well enough to already know.

Ultimately, Bee is the best wingman a kid could ever hope for. ;p",0
22743,"The gatekeeping is already very prevalent (see /r/tenet for the worst of it) but I don't think it can hold up for that long. The gimmick simply has no internal consistency, and it's hard to say ""you just don't understand it"" when the director himself didn't either.

For the simplest example, just consider the bullet holes that are already there. When do those come into existence? When the object is initially made? When it gets placed in that location? What does that ""coming into existence"" look like?

Going a little further, even assuming those holes made sense, why are they travelling backwards in time now? Because that's clearly what's happening: an inverted bullet has hit that material and now that bullet hole is for some reason inverted despite it being of a material that is not inverted. Are we assuming that once something inverted comes into contact with something non-inverted, that it inverts it? Can't be, because otherwise the inversion would spread through all the material in the world out of one bullet. Also, how would a man be pulled back into a building by some inverted material from an explosion without getting inverted himself and blown outward by the blast? No internal consistency.

There are so many other holes in the internal logic that you can find if you look further. I feel like Nolan is rather aware of this (he has Pattinson effectively say ""don't try to understand it"") but I do feel it makes this kind of gatekeeping of ""understanding"" very easy to shut down.",0

They view life in a non-linear way, so death isn't nearly as significant to them.

54691,"The Big Sick is relatable to anyone with pushy parents, or frankly anyone who has experienced a relationship (male or female). But it's especially relatable to people with pushy immigrant parents, even if they're not Pakistani like Kumail's family is. I don't really think that there's any male or female slant since Kumail wrote it with his wife, even though it's from the male perspective it's pretty gender neutral in terms of storytelling. It would be pretty easy to gender swap the roles if they wanted to. 

Not really sure why you're passive-aggressively trying to lump me in as the ""average reddit male"", Lady Bird was clearly written from a female perspective. It's a very narrow slice of life movie about a very specific kind of person growing up in a particular time in American history, and as a period piece (weird to say about a movie set in like 2002 but nevertheless...) it makes specific references to people growing up in that era. It's a movie about what it was like for Greta Gerwig to grow up in a post-9/11 Sacramento Catholic school. Don't get me wrong, it portrays that topic very well, thanks in large part to its performances, I just don't know if what the characters are going through is meant to speak to me personally outside of the more general ""parents just don't understand"" kind of thing.

Like, the scene near the end of The Big Sick where [Kumail is leaving for New York and has a moment with his dad, but his mom won't come out of the car because she's still super mad at him](#spoiler) hit me really hard, man. That was a perfect representation of what it feels like to have immigrant parents and how they react to their kids dropping the traditions they tried bringing over to North America. And while it's a moment between ['Twas the butlerfather and son](#spoiler), I don't think you need to be a [son of a father](#spoiler) to relate to it, because it also reminded me of shit my sister's gone through with my parents too, and [I've been in similar situations like that where the parental roles have been reversed and it's my dad's that's pissed and my mom consoling me](#spoiler). So I really don't think it's a gender thing.

Whereas in Lady Bird, it's very much about a daughter's relationship with her parents. The closest I came to relating to that movie is seeing basically exact conversations I've witnessed my sister have with my parents, and I know for a fact that it's really not the same thing for boys. Greta is unabashed about it being about her experience as a woman, and from a narrative perspective it's one of the film's strengths, because it's uncompromising, and I don't necessarily need to relate to the characters too much to see that, but for me it just takes it down from like the 9/9.5 that it seems to be for a lot of people to like an 8, because it's like I'm looking at it from the other side of a window, peering into this house, and it makes me feel more detached from the story than I probably could have been.

Heteronormativity is extremely predominant so I can see the beauty of trying to transgress that boundary with Chiron and his fight to keep himself from being who he truly is, but I can also see how straight men can relate to this. Although straight white men are hardly ever marginalized by society (cisgendered that is) they do still deal with times of crisis and often feelings of having to live up to certain standards set by society. Gay or straight everyone has a fear of exposing too much. That is one thing I really enjoyed about this film. Another was how tender the moments between Chiron and Kevin were. Or rather, Black and Kevin. Beautifully shot.. the end left me a bit confused because I wanted more depth between the two but with subtly depth actually speaks louder.  ",1

24598,"Just watched the movie, and coming from Denmark myself, I definitely believe the movie doesn't paint alcohol in a good or bad light. It actually accurately portrays just how drinking is in Denmark, though with some exaggerating parts (such as the high school student claiming he drinks 80 beers worth of alcohol in a week, this is more normal for University students).

I my opinion, much of the movie's meaning lies in its opening quote from Søren Kierkegaard: ""What is youth? A dream. What is love? The content of the dream."" Youth is not just a number, it's something you live and stop living when there's no love, of your life and of the world. Martin is going through a rough period of life, for whatever reasons, and for years he has been unable to find the spirit of his former youthful self (the one Anika misses), which is briefly brought back as the excitement of his success with alcohol boosts his mood, making him find the desire to go camping with family, make love with his wife, and enjoying his life. This all blows up when he's unable to control his consumption, and end up in an embarrassing situation that reveals his family knowing about his alcohol abuse, his wife's cheating on him, ultimately ending in divorce.

Before his death, Martin's childhood friend tells Martin ""I'm rooting for you, for you and Anika. It's always been the two of you"". These words serve as a motivation for Martin to rekindle lost love, and while partaking in the funeral dinner with his friends, he sees his students partying at their traditional high school graduation ""truck tour"" celebration, and receives a text from his ex-wife, telling she misses him a lot. This confirmation of rekindling his relationship with Anika and seeing the joyful students that he managed to prepare for their exam finals (to make up for his own subpar performance as a teacher) makes him love again. Love his life, love now, love the world. He finally finds a reason to dance, and let's go in euphoria as his soul, almost in an instant, looks 30 years younger.",0

10739,"The family's position in the community was predicated upon them having gifts and being magical. Abuela saw the loss of her community as well as her home when she and her husband fled. His sacrifice wasn't just for her and his children, it was for the entire community of refugees. So the community is her responsibility in her eyes and to destroy that, is to forsake the sacrifice of her husband. 

She was the architect of this community for so long, which is why everything had to conform to her vision. Isabella had to be married to that other family to strengthen the community, in her eyes. Everyone had to see her family as the strength or else she feared it would crumble. This is why Bruno was ostracized after the community interpreted him as a harbinger of bad news. It hurt her family's position. This is also why Mirabel was kept at arms length. Her lack of a gift made the family look weaker. Again, this is why the little cousin's ceremony was so important to Abuela.

This is all to say, the gift itself was less important than just having a gift. Because having a gift helped maintain the credibility of her family and further strengthened Abuela's idea of the community.",0

I loved the parallels between how Angela and the sheriff deal with their own pain, one emotional and the other physical, but none of these themes seemed to carry over into the rest of the movie.

The tonal shifts I also found a little odd, and nowhere near as deftly handled as in *In Bruges*. A lot of the writing, while technically good, seems very self-satisfied, and in some cases, like in Willoughby's suicide notes, are borderline contrived in how ""movie-ish"" they seem.

49360,"If you've ever suffered personal pain so intense that you've entered a period of self-destruction, you've entered the shimmer.

* Time gets distorted. If you've been in a dark place of depression or self-destruction, it's easy to lose days, weeks, or months.

* Communication to the outside world is cut off. If you've been in a hole, you know it's tough for others to reach you and you to reach out.

* Reality gets distorted. Events of the past and who you are get reflected in a way that is a mutation of reality. This could lead to seeing things horrifically but also can lead to seeing creative, beautiful things too - as Lena noted. (And why many artists have periods of self-destruction.) 

* There's a chance monsters (aka ""personal demons"") will tear you apart.

* Some who enter the shimmer don't want answers and they don't want out. The fight is gone. They just want to fade out and disappear, like the physicist who gently becomes part of the landscape. This is a moving portrayal of depression and would guess this part hits some people very, very hard.

For those in the shimmer fighting to find the truth - or ""the light"" - many will die before they get there. (The soldier's bones outside the lighthouse)

Kane does reach the lighthouse but he can't defeat the alien. Sometimes in life one reaches a situation so painful that one does not have the ability to handle it - something like a mental breakdown. At that point in life, who somebody is - their identity - incapable of handling the present situation has no choice but to blow themselves up. The Kane that survives the shimmer is a clone, he's not the Kane that went in. This could be seen as a metaphor for those who when entering a period of self-destruction get hammered and destroyed. They make it out, but the person who makes it out is not the same person who entered.

Lena reaches the lighthouse and the alien, her enemy, the one that blocks the door from her escaping, the one that mirrors and mimics her, she sees as herself. 

This is perhaps an inspirational message to those dealing with self-destructive issues. It's you who is blocking you and the only way you make it out of the shimmer is to blow that shit up.

Once she does that, the shimmer vanishes and Kane recovers. This may be a metaphor for somebody who successfully is able to defeat  their self-destructive tendencies. Things return to normal and those around them heal, even if nobody is quite the same as before they entered.

And for the shimmer appearing in their eyes. If you have been through a period of self-destruction, you can often see it in the eyes of others who have been there too. This may sound silly to some but those experiences really do change one's character. One can often pick out others who have been down a similar path.",0

49502,"The scream bear scene is where the major metaphor dawned on me. The shimmer is cancer (obviously) but the characters all represent different approaches to dealing with it. 
The scream bear represents the how people remember someone suffering through chemo. Her character had lost a daughter to leukemia and mentioned how it basically killed her former self. She represents fighting and losing painfully, dying in misery and your family and friend’s memory of you is forever replaced by your final pain. 
The physicist represented those who chose not to fight and suffer. Ultimately she dies, but without pain, and peacefully and she leaves behind a pleasant memory. 
The psychologist represents the psychologic trauma and depression that cancer victims have. 
The EMT represents denial. She accuses the others of inventing the bear, and just wants to “go back” but there is no going back.  Additionally, she has a substance abuse past, probably a call to those who turn to addiction or self medicating. 
The biologist represents intellecualizing the situation. A defense mechanism where people just try to keep gathering information, and think if they can understand it, they can regain control. 

When she escapes, she is kept in isolation, a common thing for cancer patients. The scientist interviewing her with all the young scientist watching are like residents on rounds in a hospital. 

The clones represent how nobody is ever the same after surviving cancer. The anthroplogist who’s daughter died of leukemia said as much earlier in the film. 

Finally, her and Kane at the end represent how even a tiny bit of remaining cancer can restart the whole process. They metastasized away from the primary tumor, and though the primary tumor was destroyed, they cancer threat remains.

Even when I was *slightly* disinterested in the middle third of the movie, I think the constant musical score held me in just enough to not get lost. If my mind ever wandered away from the story, the movie was so well-crafted that I instead was obsessing over the acting and the details of production.

I don't know if I'll ever find myself watching Phantom Thread again, but I have thought about it a **ton** after leaving the theater which to me is a great quality in a film. So many times I'll watch an enjoyable movie and then forget about it before I even get home. This one lingered in my mind for a while.

The story and characters really benefitted from the much smaller cast through the first and second act. I  felt like I connected to the characters this time better than I have in any Marvel film since Winter Soldier and the first Guardians film because of the added time the movie was able to spend with them. 

Ultimately I thought this movie managed to walk a tight rope really, really well. It managed to subvert expectations early on with what they do to Thanos and the Stones, making what is ultimately a fairly predictable outcome into a more unique than expected journey. I like that the Avengers have to plan and strategize and really rely on their intelligence to win, rather than *just* punching and shooting a lot. 

I also would just like to say that this movie was a very bittersweet send off for the two pillars of this franchise; Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. It seemed inevitable what would ultimately happen with Tony, but I didnt see the ending for Cap coming and found it strangely satisfying.

35858,"I think the movie is suggesting that while the cult makes its violence open and public, it is no more violent than the world outside the cult. In both cases, death is inevitable, and both feature horrific murders and suicides (the sister killing the parents and herself is not that different from the cult's final murder/suicide fire ritual). The difference is that in the world outside the cult, pain is suppressed (Dani excusing herself to the bathroom whenever she feels grief), while in the cult, pain is not only shared (Dani sobbing in unison with the other women after catching Christian cheating) but ritualized. From the cult's perspective, if death and pain are inevitable, better to shine a harsh light on them (literally!) and see them clearly, no matter how gruesome that process might be. And while the outside world fails in guiding both the sister and Dani through their pain, Dani is able to find some peace in the cult by bringing her pain into the light.",0

The writing here was impeccable, the animation incredible, and the world building was breathtaking. The amount of thought put into what would normally be considered throwaway details, such as handing a giraffe a drink at a shop, was amazing. I know I would need to watch it again because there's so many little details like parody billboards and businesses in the background. I can't even think of enough positive adjectives to describe this film -- it's pretty much as close to the high end Pixar tier that Disney has ever come. 

The premise of a Bunny Cop surviving in the big city alone was interesting enough to drive the story, and then they kept adding layers to it. I also appreciated how there wasn't a major protagonist throughout most of the film, it was society and prejudice that was our villain. I felt that this is by far the funniest Disney film of recent memory. I appreciate that it respects that children can handle such a complex and maybe even scary story. It didn't need fart jokes to keep the audience's attention and they knew it.

The original stage directions read...
""*(Gabriel, with great fanfare, braces himself to blow. The trumpet is without a mouthpiece. He puts the end of it into his mouth and blows with great force, like a man who has been waiting some twenty-odd years for this single moment. No sound comes out of the trumpet. He braces himself and blows again with the same result. A third time he blows. There is a weight of impossible description that falls away and leaves him bare and exposed to a frightful realization. It is a trauma that a sane and normal mind would be unable to withstand. He begins to dance. A slow, strange dance, eerie and life-giving. A dance of atavistic signature and ritual. LYONS attempts to embrace him. GABRIEL pushes LYONS away. He begins to howl in what is an attempt at song, or perhaps a song turning back into itself in an attempt at speech. He finishes his dance and the gates of heaven stand open as wide as God's closet.)*""

All things considered, they handled it in a pretty tame way. Seems like August Wilson wanted to put something in to make certain that all performances/interpretations would be slightly different.

20959,"Spike Lee has a few gems and a few bombs in his filmography, and this joint feels like a compilation series of both.

The first half of this film was very solid. My biggest gripe is when Otis goes to see the girl -- the acting in this scene from her was bad beyond comprehension as to how she got hired. Everything else I highly enjoyed and the stylistic choices I found to be very suitable. The aspect ratio switches, the choice to keep them old in the flashbacks, everything had me hooked. Funny enough, I actually stopped this movie midway through because I had to go to sleep and I picked back up on it today.

And honestly I wish I stopped there. The very MOMENT this movie goes to complete hell is when the first guy blows up. It felt like the cheapest route to go narratively to raise the stakes and keep conflict. At this point, I was like ""why the hell couldn't they have just gone home and spent their money, happy ending?"" I liked the scene of getting the son off the mine, and I wish they switched that moment around so it could be the last thing that happens when they're in the jungle -- it would've been a great climax -- then they go home and I would've felt very satisfied. I would've felt they found the gold in an oddly easy way, but hey, better than what happens next. But nope, more unnecessary emotion porn needs to occur.

Now we have to deal with the landmine experts, the soldiers searching for the gold, Paul going apeshit, a double cross from a French man, and a big shoot out that results in most of them dying, and for WHAT? What did any of that add to the film? With the main message being about the war haunting these people and the torture it puts on others, everything had already been said. It turned into a cheap action movie with the dumb twist of Paul accidentally killing Norman too -- WHY? Can't he just be fucked up for the sake of being in a fucked up war, we have to add some guilty conscious bullshit too?

I'm not sure of Lee's intent with the second half. Was it supposed to feel like a nightmare? Like a bad drug trip? If so, he succeeded, but what is that trying to convey? How is it suitable to fit with the first half of the movie which felt fairly by the numbers for a Lee movie?

Anyway, Delroy Lindo was fantastic, but this movie needed another rewrite, and if not, at least another draft of editing to trim this thing at least 15-20 more minutes down. I didn't HATE it, but I am very disappointed because it could've been great all around. Instead, they threw on an extra hour and a half for what felt like no reason.

The danger of a dark comedy like this is that you run the danger of making light of the awful situation itself and the whole thing feels crass as a result. But with this - they never make light of the situation itself, the comedy is very much on a personal level, focusing on the people and their bickering. 

The decision not to use Russian accents was perfect, allowing them to rapid-fire punchlines without having to give the audience time to decode the accents. It also gave every joke another mini-punchline - hearing the mighty Zhukov deliver his insults in a Yorkshire accent, for example.

So many issues of separation and distance in the movie. The distant airplane. The car squeezing into the courtyard, between the trucks, fermin ritualistically forcing distance with his dance of threat. Separating books from bookcases. Class.  Brothers.

20982,"The only problems I had were a bit major for me. I thought it was weird that when Eddie died, no one really anguished in pain or lamented. No tears shed for a fallen brother even if hes blown to bits. 

I attributed this to the fact that they have PTSD and that over the years they have become desensitized to pain, death and suffering, as evidenced in Paul's frequent dreaming of Norman (guilt). 

But really?? Considering the fact that these guys have a serious bond toughened by war experiences I assumed it would have been way more hurtful to them.

But in a way this might be genius. War is dysfunctional. Correct me if I'm wrong but a more subtle message is that dysfunctional things and arbitrary chaos arise from such events?? Vietnam was a disaster and extremely chaotic and brutal. Though their bonds are forged in steel, they are forged in brutality, coldness and blood - with war, perhaps their humanity has been forsaken. The group is dysfunctional because war is dysfunctional. If so, genius move.

Also, as others pointed out, it was weird and a bit dumb how at one point, David is friends with Hedy at the bar, then when they see each other, Paul takes them hostage. Theres a lot of tension right after with Hedy taunting David. Then in the middle of the night when they take the gun away from Paul, they seem much more amicable even though the LAMB trio are literal hostages who only wanted to do good. Even they arent let go. If I was taken hostage, I'd definitely be pissed and continue to do so. 

And then after they just seemed like friends, even after Seppo got blown up by a mine (in a predicament he wouldn't be in if it were not for Paul). But I do appreciate that this bit got a bit more emotional as Hedy and the other guy cried over Seppos death, but similarly to Eddie's, they got over it really quickly!! And they dont have PTSD or fought in a war.

Vinh was my favourite such a chill cool guy... is it normal to be casually willing to fight against a militia with the high risk of dying?

Have to say that I loved Marvin's songs being woven throughout. Love the album so the moment I first heard the first song I smiled. Such a significant album with meanings and lessons echoing today. Similarly, I thought the flashbacks were cool.

One thing I didnt really like was that Norman was meant to be a well-respected figure who past down lessons to the Bloods. He preached compassion and love, but this wasnt strongly demonstrated. Do I just assume this is because of PTSD? Perhaps also taking into account these guys are tired vets who have perhaps become a bit senile in their old age (which is common). This might then be a very good decision by Spike 

Acting was good, especially by Lindo. Boseman is naturally charismatic so great casting. Many themes woven through and many messages could be interpreted, the most obvious being about racial injustice but more nuanced ones being about bonds forged in war, human nature and fragility of morality.

Could it be that this is what the characters in the novel represent;

Tony = Susan
Isla = Edward
India = aborted child 
Bobby = Hutton
3×killers = The wealthy life

If this is true it would make sense that Tony isn't driven so much by revenge. Just as he hunts the ones who murdered his family, Susan hunts the wealthy life. The hunt eventually kills the gang, and Susan is losing her highlife. 
Bobby offers support when Tony's family is dead.
Hutton offers support after the abortion, same time as Edward dies inside realising about the abortion.
Bobby turns out to have cancer which will lead to his death hence leaving Tony.
Hutton turns out to have an affair which will lead to a divorce hence leaving Susan.
The hunt for the killers leads Tony to accidently shooting himself.
The hunt for wealth and fame leads to Susan realising the life she chose only led to her dying inside.

Therefore, Edward is not showing up at the end. Because he left her life a long time ago when Susan decided to live the life she lives. 
Just as Isla died along time ago when Ray and his gang entered Tony's life.

I saw it as a metaphor for how artificial and almost offensive the ""image"" of the American dream, yet how desperately people still cling to it thinking it will save them.

It had so much potential, but I felt the pacing was all wrong; there was too much focus on irrelevant side plots and it took too long to build up to the climax. In fact, there was almost **no point** to that first 15-30 minutes of the film. I understand that first few scenes was trying to establish the two main characters. In particular, that Hercule was ""the greatest detective alive"" and Ratchett was ""the bad greedy gangster"". The acting itself was good, but I disliked how the main villain and protagonist were portrayed in such one-dimensional way.

Same goes for the introduction of a lewd womanizer director and the star-crossed couple. **NONE of these characters** really needed to be introduced to the audience at this point. I think it would've made a more compelling plot, if all of the suspects starting being introduced to the audience after the murder, and it would make a more exciting build up as we get to know each character's motives. 

I understand the plot is based on the book, but they could've taken the liberty of shortening the parts that are not important. Especially considering how this is supposed to be a mystery/thriller, slow paced first half did not work well. 

The movie did pick up in the latter half, but the ending was a COMPLETE contradiction to what was established. The ENTIRE film had depicted our hero as a black-and-white logical perfectionist, then SUDDENLY he realizes there was more to justice than right or wrong the last 3 minutes of the film. IF this trait was to change, I would've liked to see him to go through **some sort of emotional character development** which forces him to come to this conclusion. (what was the deal about the dead wife/gf Katherine? *more irrelevant plots*) Instead, he just magically decided he, for the first time ever in his life, does not care about bringing the real murderer to justice. Because guess what? The man who was murdered was ""a bad guy"" who made everyone suffer emotionally. [Why were we not given Rachett's motive for kidnap? I thought *surely* the ending was going to be that: Rachett's kidnap was *somehow* justified and murderers realize how justice is not black-and-white after all](#spoiler). The conclusion bothered me more than anything else in the film.

On my first watch-through, I was really disappointed by the lack of explanation given for phenomenon. Literally, the first time the Protag asks someone ""how does this work"", and they tell him ""don't think about it"". I feel like that is the underlying motive behind most of the writing throughout the film: not that there is some reasonable explanation in the writer's mind about how things work the way they do within the movie, but that they just want the world to just move and work a certain way and their viewer's desire for explanation is just not important enough for dialogue.

I feel that this movie drops from ""cerebral thriller"" to ""poorly explained special effects cash-grab"". They milked the sh\*t out of the moving forward//moving backward effect, even blowing up a building in two different ""directions"" back-to-back. Cool. But the explanation for things was like ""quantum science genius-babble"" at best and.... ""just dont think about it"" at worst.

In the final climactic battle scene, I kept thinking ""who are they fighting?"" and ""why do they never show who they are fighting?"" It seems like the soldiers are just shooting stuff: buildings, rocks, windows... and the whole plot item of ""The Algorithm"".... what the hell is that? It has 9 pieces, but he has 8 of them already, and if you assemble it, the world's time is reversed and... the universe ends? But not when it is assembled, but when the bad guy dies...

And what is why the film is excellent, the character relations, dialogue, and performances make you oscillate from caring to thinking a character is a bitch. The story leaves you guessing with what's going to happen now and you're compelled to find out.

Also noteworthy is Emma Stone's English accent. It feels natural and not too overly done.

There were so many subtle details now that I look back. The real Adelaide (Red) was always wanting to handcuff Adelaide like she had done to her when she switched.

Also, Red whistling right before she dies, and Adelaide doing those growls and grunts while killing her was their true identities coming out.

Then when he writes this book and the ending is the symbolic death of his weakness, wouldn't ya know that she falls back in love with him?

I also think it's possible for Tony to be killing Walker. Sounds crazy, but think about it! In the book, the policeman that helps Tony kill the antagonists is pretty clearly acting as Edward's subconscious and what he wants to do but never could. The policeman in the book makes it possible. Now at the end of the book, weak Tony died because of Ray--who clearly represents the person Susan becomes after the Susan Edward loves ""dies""--but the policeman is still alive. If you buy the fact that he's a part of Edward, then by the end of the book he's the only part left. The violent, nothing to lose cowboy, doing whatever it takes to seek justice.

And the fact that the mother pays for Sean to leave and takes the money just like that shows he's a low character. He could at least have a heart and stay for his wife while she grieves. The plot was kind of misleading acting like the movie would be about their relationship after this tragedy when it was more about Martha. And I'm honestly glad the midwife didn't get in trouble at the end since I did blame more Martha. It was true that Sean told her she should go to a hospital and she said no. Maybe the baby would have had a better chance of living if she was born in the hospital in case an emergency happened.!<",0

And when they let go of that, you are free in a myriad of ways. The scenes can be longer. Ideas being explored in dialogue or otherwise can be more sophisticated.

61736,"Unrelated to the film itself, aside from the screening of which being the setting of the story, I had an interesting audience encounter during a trip to the theater to see Murder on the Orient Express last weekend.

During the pre-trailer, ""coming to network TV this fall"" type fare, a gentleman came in and asked my girlfriend and I ""Does anyone know why this whole row of empty seats was unavailable to buy?"". Not feeling as though I needed to articulate the way most theaters work regarding assigned seating and buying tickets online ahead of time and how, in all likelihood, those people bought good seats ahead of time and are now free to show up whenever they like without worrying about getting a good seat, I just said ""I guess they're not here yet?"" and continued chatting with my girlfriend as the man sat next to me.

As the lights lowered for the trailers, the man leaned over toward me and said ""Don't be offended if I get up and go down to a better seat when the movie starts"", to which I responded with a thumbs up as if to demonstrate I understood, but didn't really care what he did or didn't do as a complete stranger I happened to be sitting near at a movie.

So...before the murder even took place, this man who had initially seemed very concerned with his theater going experience fell asleep. Now, as I typically don't make an effort to look around and check the attentiveness of the people who are attending the same screening as I am, I usually don't notice or care if someone falls asleep during a movie. The only reason I was aware the guy was asleep is, being the person sitting closest to him I was the first to hear the snoring. After the first audible snore, I squeezed my girlfriends hand and turned toward her with wide-eyes and a a pursed smirk, which she responded to with bewilderment until the following snore which was loud enough for her to hear and caused her confused stare to mimic my surprised expression.

I whispered ""What do I do?"" as the mans snores grew louder and louder, all the while I could see past her every person on our row had begun to lean forward in their seats in our direction at the surprisingly loud snoring. I'm talking about a level of snoring that would lead a loved one to insist you see a doctor, the entire theater could hear the snoring, as evidenced by the growing murmuring and giggling of the audience members. I could suddenly see people in the row in front of us sitting up in their seats to turn around and see who was making this cartoonishly loud snoring.

When it became clear that, to my surprise, the sound of his own snoring wasn't going to wake him up, I realized this was my responsibility to take care of as the person seated closest to him. Not being a big fan of touching people I don't know, especially when they're sleeping, I thought to myself ""I'll just clear my throat and he'll wake up, right?"", but rather than pulling off a gentle but firm, traditional throat-clearing ""Uhm-huh"" I'd intended, I released a single, loud ""UH"" as if being punched in the gut which startled the man mid-snore causing an even louder final snarled snore, which in turn made the entire theater burst out laughing.

Twenty or thirty minutes later, the man stood up and left. I felt really bad, I'd intended to save him from the embarrassment of interrupting a movie by loudly snoring, only to inadvertently make a show of his snoring that led to an entire theater laughing at him and likely even more embarrassment. If the snoring man is out there, I'm sorry. I hope that you left because you were either tired or uninterested in the movie and not because everyone laughed at you.",0

16030,"Fincher is channeling Kael very hard here,more than the one scene from I'm Thinking of Ending Things. The central lie at the heart of Kael's hatchet job is that Orson imploded after Kane and even Kane only works cause of everyone excpet for Kane. 

The truth is that Orson's career was ruined by the studio system from Kane onwards and especially with tje superior Maginificent Ambersands. The whole ""Welles is too much if a big shot who flamed out"" is debunked by the mete existence of his ither great films such as Touch of Evil,F For Fake,Chimes At Midnight and Other Sude of the Wind - all of which show that Orson improved and pushed himself further as much as he could and more importantly that he was flexible enough to work with different crews,genres,styles and even different industries. Whether or not the studio fucked him over is easily proven by comparing the studio cut of Touch of Evil vs the director's cut.

Not sure if David is parroting very obviously diengenouous and debunked crop just to be edgy and reactionary or he's drunk way too much of the Kael kool-aid. Its even.weirder knowing that Fincher knows a thing or two about studio fuckery ala Alien 3.

Citien Kane while great isn't even his best film,F For Fake and Touch of Evil are so much better. Hopefully we are blessed to get the true version of Ambersands someday.

Maybe we should really praise Darius Kanji,Trent Reznor,Cronanwith,Sorkin and Angus Wall for Fincher's success amd blame Fincher for Alien 3 instead. Fincher's just a big phony surrounded by a cult of fanboys just like mean old Mr Orson Welles.

56441,"The movie plays out a brilliant world setting.

LA is dark, wet, polluted and gritty. The landscape of the world (with a wall to keep the ocean out) is dystopian as fuck, and you get the feeling that humanity is on the backslide. Apartments are crammed up together and everything is dirty and kept only barely functional.

Meanwhile, the movie also sets out an incredible power dynamic between the police and the corporate world (both of which are omnipresent and are only challenged by one another. The police are oppressive and intimidating in their imposing structure. At one scene in the movie, there's a shot of blood being cleaned off a wall of the inside of the LAPD. It's obvious that, in the complete absence of any social welfare like education or decent opportunities for the population, the authorities are the ones who pick up the slack.

Yet we see Luv just walking around the LAPD station on two occasions, and in both instances she straight up murders a police officer. Corporate power is at such a point that it can basically strongarm itself into institutions of order and authority to maintain its might, and nothing will change that. Even at the end of the film, Wallace's power remains unassailable. 

It really makes me want to know more about the world in which Blade Runner is set. There's nothing mentioned (at least in 2049, I haven't seen the original in over a decade) about the political hierarchy above the police. There's no US flags anywhere in LA (which, to an Australian, seems weird since Americans show off their flag a lot). What's the media like? Is there an informed citizenry? Does everyone who isn't super rich live in a derelict apartment, or is there a middle class with access to a decent middle ground between the extremes, while still suffering the same consequences of overpopulation? Just thinking about it, we actually don't get very good of an idea as to much beyond the dynamic of unchecked corporate might and mass consumerism on a horrific scale.",0

Have Favreau/Marks spoken to this yet?

I was anticipating it, and was looking forward to how they'd do it, but the movie didn't end with the girl fetching water and flirting with Mowgli, luring him into the village ultimately. Instead it ends just before that scene, when Bagheera, Mowgli and Baloo are celebrating (on a tree together, in this case – which was adorable, yes, obviously).

So are they having Mowgli stay in the jungle for the sequel? Would have been cool to see this scene play out in this new world, but if it's coming in a sequel I suppose maybe that's just as fine.

I think it’s a bit fresh that we don’t see the film largely from Ellsburg’s perspective, but when unecessary, cloying scenes like those come into play, I totally get why people are arguing that he and other figures should’ve been given a greater role.",1

This was especially annoying because I really wanted to get invested but it was nearly impossible with everyone just taking me out of the experience. I'll definetly watch this again when it comes out on Blu-ray, but it was a shame that my first watch was ruined by other people.

But while I absolutely love that scene from CMBYN, it is so clearly written, too perfectly articulated to be real. It worked for that movie but why I think the fire scene here was perfect was because it fit well in this movie. The father here was clearly speaking sincerely but he was fumbling over his words because that’s what happens in real life when an unexpected moment to connect comes up. He has some moments of clarity that really get across his point but  mostly he is just repeating himself and saying platitudes because that’s what real people do. To me this was a theme throughout the movie, so many scenes (the dinner with the boy at the end, the scene in the food court, the pool party) that felt very grounded in reality rather than movie tropes.

32618,"Yeah I'm a bit surprised that everyone is completely dismissing her character as a villain. Throughout the film, Marta associates herself with the most genuine characters and really doesn't have a relationship with the shallow / hollow / malicious ones. Marta is seen to have three friends in the film: Harlan, Meg, and the PI. These are the people who see her as an actual person and take interest in forming a relationship with her. None of them are perfect in their actions, but they all have redeeming qualities that generally outweigh the bad. 

I think, as you said, Meg is caught in an impossible situation and does what pretty much any of us would do if our entire family were pushing us in a certain direction. Marta immediately reconciles the relationship once they are in contact again and does not hold a grudge whereas she makes no similar effort with anyone else in the family. She sees right through Walt and Joni's attempts at faux kindness and never fully associates herself with Ransom. 

So I totally agree, I think that Meg is one of the few characters who actually cares about Marta and is not just using her.",0

Yo don't see much male nudity in movies so when it happens it gets more attention. Most of those movies are made to appeal women with a story that tend to lead to sex, even though, in an age of feminism, obviously most women roll eyes to stories with such sexist takes, and prefer real sex or porn.

While it's not cup of tea, there's room for erotic movies. I would only wish that they stopped with such offensive stories, but well..  it's fantasy and there's people who fantasize with it.",0

37312,"I really loved it.

I loved how they subverted the biopic cliché of starting with the “big concert”, with him dramatically opening the door in costume and then we find out it’s actually the real most important moment in the story - going to rehab.

I loved all of the musical sequences.
They were all fitting and creative, and Taron’s singing is so good.
 The whole rocketman sequence was especially breathtaking.

I loved the framing device that let them get away with some of the cheesier moments (picking the “John” part)

I loved how it was gay positive and didn’t show being gay as a sin that deserved punishment (ahem Bohemian AHEM).
Even though the “gay sex scene” that I heard so much about in the media lasted for 10 seconds.


When the movie is good, it’s really really good. I really wish Bohemian Raphsody was half as good and as eigth as creative.


The movie does sometimes falls on genre clichés, and some of the dialogue is bad, you can see that the movie has real heart and everyone gave their a game, especially Taron.


My mom was a bit sad though that they didn’t put her favorite song, Sacrifice, in.

Edit: 
some more things I forgot to mention:

- The edit of the ""I'm still standing"" music video in the end ... was not great. Taron did everything perfectly of course, but you could very very clearly see he was green screened in. They didn't degrade him to match to quality of the video. I'm honestly surprised they didn't just reshot it.

- I really wish John Reid got a bit more depth in the end. I didn't like that they ended it with ""You're incapable of love"". I don't know the story IRL, but even in the movie it seems that it was at least partially Elton's fault for the mess of the relationship. I think they could have fleshed him out a bit more instead of turning him into a generic villain.

- The ending text felt very much out of place. After the emotional ending the ""still shopaholic"" thing fell completely flat at least for me. 
And the AIDS charity he has I'm sure is amazing, but really just isn't relevant to the movie, like Elton required it to be there.

- The coming out to his mom scene was really well done. 
That moment of relief when you think he is getting acceptance, and then replaced by the crushing disappointment. Like I know that this is a standard scene in this type of movie, but the way it was written and acted was just perfect to me and I think it deserves a mention.",0

He was so lost looking for power for a thousand years only to realize it was love that he was looking for. He found it and was ready to die for it. Gave up his immortality to grow old with her. To have a family with her. He was complete. And so was she. But his karma caught up to him. His past came for him and he wasn’t there. But his family was. I don’t think he really blames Shang-chi in that ending scene. I think he was mad and rash but because of how he responds in the end, he knows it was all his fault. He couldn’t come to the village because his past, so she gave up her powers. And his past actions killed his wife. He really loved her and really researched how to find her. I think the thing that’s so beautiful about this story is the master level of writing and acting in Tony Leung’s character. He really did change. He could have become a hero, and you could argue he did in the very end. Her love did that.

26192,"There are a couple bits during the movie that perhaps non-korean audience members may not immediately understand due to cultural differences. And I want to share more insight into these cultural bits cause I found them fascinating and hilarious! Apologies if these were already said before in the thread, but here’s my go if you’re interested in reading:

1. Fruit is extremely expensive in South Korea that it’s considered a dessert. The wealthy family has an abundance of fruit in the house, where the housekeeper continuously brings fruit to the children when they are tutoring. A box of cherries is around $18 and one watermelon is $20 in Korea to give you a better understanding. You never see the poor family eating fruit, unless it’s in the wealthy house. 

2. The rich mom keeps saying to her friends on the phone to not bring gifts to the party, that they can just come at eat hors d’oeuvres. In fact, she tells her friends 3 different times not to bring gifts, and when the guests arrive, her friend emerges out the taxi with a bunch of gifts and there is a quick shot of the table full on gifts in the backyard. This is customary for Koreans and actually a bit funny. Many Koreans say not to bring gifts, but it is always expected that the guests bring gifts to an event (especially a birthday party). If you don’t bring a gift, it’s considered disrespectful.

3. In the same scene as above, the rich mom tells her friend that since the friend drives a Mini Cooper, they can park it in the garage when they arrive. We even see this happen, as they are backing up the Mini Cooper in the garage and the mom says not to cover the Benz. This is because a Mini Cooper is considered “less high status” and not a luxury car in Korea, so they want to hide it in the garage so other people don’t see the non-luxury car. If you remember throughout the whole movie that many people keep mentioning the Benz (the driver who says ride the Benz instead of the subway, the poor children who ask if the dad ever drove Benz before as a driver, when Ki-woo and his dad are at the Benz store studying the car, the many scenes inside the Benz, and at the end when the rich father yells at the poor father to give him the keys to the Benz). Basically, the Benz car is the best car you can have in Korea to show your wealth and status, so it’s hilarious that the rich family would want to hide the Mini Cooper before the party.

4. Koreans use the app KakaoTalk, not WeChat. In post production, they thought that the non-Korean audiences would recognize WeChat more instantly so they went with that translation/subtitle instead.",1

Towards the end, after ""The Beast"" has taken over, all I could of think from the shots behind Mcavory was ""THE GREAT RED 
DRAGON"" from Red Dragon/Hannibal. 

The very end of the movie blew my mind and I hope something more comes out of it. 

Cinematography is very well done,Mike Gioulakis has been making some beautiful recent films. 

Mcavory really surprised me with his performances in this movie, he flip flopped between them very seamlessly and I didn't really find myself questioning his acting at any point.
 Anya Taylor-Joy over the last year or so, has shot up my list for favorite current actresses. I know she's only been in a few movies but she was very good in this, as well as everything else I've seen her in. 

 Only complaint was that I found myself cheering against the other two girls. Wasn't crazy about either character.

Frances McDormand is a fine actor, but we get very little about her character or motivation to live in a van as a nomad.  As the New Yorker review points out....

*""Fern and David also tend to speak in one-liners, or, like the other characters, offer brief (albeit poignant, pain-filled) anecdotes that hit the motivic nail on the head and drive it quickly into its place in the script, explaining with little give or detail what traumas or difficulties spurred them to choose the nomadic life.""*

Also, the film offers a Pollyannaish view of homelessness that is now typical of Hollywood. We don't meet a single ""houseless"" person who has issues with alcoholism, addiction or mental illness. There is no chaos here. We see no crime of any kind. Everyone is just a poor victim of capitalism. All it took was one bad break and now they're living in their vans and cars. 

The cinematography was quite good, as was the film's score. But there isn't enough here in terms of story, character or depth for me to recommend NOMADLAND.",1

68842,"I have seen this movie now seven times. I have come to the conclusion that it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. 

Kenneth Lonergan is the most gifted writer alive next to Annie Baker. A few points:

1. Those who find the movie melodramatic, I respect your opinion, but I also feel you might not be paying attention. The melodramatic sequence in this movie (the fire and S.A.) specifically exists as a flashback. The movie is not about the melodramatic event of someone's life, and we very specifically do not see the central marriage disintegrate. It's about what happens after the opera curtain comes down. Stories have a natural progression of ending in tragedy or using tragedy as their central focal point, but this is about dealing with the pain of the old memory after you've already made a new one. I think the movie as a whole would be almost as powerful as it is now if they removed the flashback sequence (though it does jerk the tears), and I wish that Lonergan didn't include it, not because he doesn't handle it effectively, but because I think it causes a lot of people to misinterpret the film (not saying that I'm somehow more perceptive, but I have a lot of experience with Kenneth Lonergan, having seen and read a ton of his work, and this is a fairly common thread in some of his plays.)

2. The way that Lonergan approaches cliché situations and manages to subvert them, not with any kind of spectacular plotting but with merely his ear for the way people talk, is kind of amazing. He reveals the truth in clichés. A lot of his plays cover this same topic as well (and are of equal quality to this movie)

3. Lucas Hedges is amazing in this movie, and basically gives the masculine counterpoint to Anna Paquin's performance in Margaret. If anyone actually cares, I could go into more detail here.

4. If you like this move, check out Margaret (extended cut), which is from the same writer/director and is possibly my favorite movie of all time.",1

The script was just great and most of the actors are doing a great job. Zachary Levi was a perfect pick, the kid actors for most of the time were really good, and a surprisingly standout performance from Cooper Andrews (foster dad). 

I certainly don’t think it’s perfect though. I thought the villain & the seven sins were under-written considering how much screen time they got. I think Mark Strong did a good job with what he had but overall his character fell flat. If we wanna get nit picky there are a certainly a lot of plot conveniences but this is a movie about a teenager transforming into a lightening spewing adult in a cheesy suit by saying a name so i’m not gonna complain too much.

I think what makes this better than Wonder Woman was that it stuck it’s landing while WW lost all its momentum in the final bits.

A rainstorm ruined the rich man's day out. A rainstorm destroyed the poor people's homes.

I read the story on Wikipedia, it made no sense, then I came here, read what the movie was really about and I am a bit intrigued. 

I caught quite early that the Janitor and Jake were possibly the same person, but I did not get in my limited viewing that the all the scenes in the past were fantasy. What REALLY bothers me, is the choice to frame the past events/fantasies from the point of view of the girl. It makes no sense, even when you know the twist, and it just makes the plot and especially the first viewing that much more obtuse and frustrating. 

Why are we watching these events unfold from the point of view of a semi-conscious figment of imagination, if the point of the movie is that they are subjective memories of a real person?

Also, in Jewish families it’s incredibly common for mothers and older women to dote over younger girls/young women and criticize their weight, particularly by telling them to eat more. Food is a huge part of Jewish culture and one of the most common ways we show love and care is by trying to nourish each other/get everyone to eat more.

It’s somehow both patronising and not dumbed down enough. It speaks down to the audience about the basics but dedicates all of a few seconds to far more complex topics. The unitary executive theory for example. The film spends at least 15 minutes explaining and re-explaining that, when it’s really not hard to grasp. Meanwhile Cheney’s entire motivation for Iraq is explained with a 5 second shot of a map of oil fields and a 20 second conversation about Halliburton’s billing practices. That’s fine for people who know their recent history, but those same people don’t need the concept of Presidential executive power hammered home two dozen times. I’m not sure who this movie was meant for.

They're always looking at someone else -- which could be interpreted as a failure to introspect. When Christian is inside the bear at the end, they say something to the effect of ""reflect on your wickedness."" The exception to this being during Dani's bad trip, when seeing her own reflection snaps her out of it.

There's also the psychological concept of [mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_\(psychology\)) -- something the Harga do to empathize with and comfort one another.

I saw Christian's major flaw as refusing to believe Dani. He is chronically unsupportive and challenges Dani every chance he gets. The Harga, on the other hand, are empathetic to the extreme. When Dani is crying on the floor of the cabin with the women surrounding her, they are quite literally *mirroring* her pain. I think for the first time, Dani sees herself in another person.

Mismatched tone, barely a tracking story, a shitty and contrived narration that came out of nowhere, and flipping around to so many times and vignettes that it’s hard to focus on a story. It feels like the entire movie was just the trailer for Vice, and I keep expecting McKay to be like “gotcha” and give us the actual movie. It’s a shame, too, because the cast is...... okay? While I don’t blame this on the actors, they barely got a chance to show their chops. While I understand that Cheney was fairly emotionless, he is portrayed as a robot. Lynne is good acting by Amy Adams, but she barely gets any lines, and Rumsfeld is literally just Steve Carell being Steve Carell. Jesse Plemons is, in my opinion, the best actor in the film, but still never gets a chance to do anything, is the wrong choice for his part, and I do detest that he’s even there.

Also, we never really go behind the scenes of the really bad stuff that Cheney did- in fact we never go behind the scenes at all. We never even see him start his company. It’s all told to us, by a contrived narration. Everybody knows that the first rule of film school is Show, don’t Tell, and McKay apparently was absent that day.

Despite the few good emotional scenes within the movie they are very brief and overall don’t really matter because he just changes his mind about playing music off screen which was underwhelming.

Even though it was CGI with inhuman proportions you could definitely tell that someone was actually there interacting with Natalie Portman, just based on how she reacted to it.

When K first visits Wallace's building, and they put that little glass globe into the machine to read the archive or whatever, it plays Deckard's old interrogation of Rachel.

K _doesn't_ kill the one that lands on his hand, and then doesn't harm any of the dozens that cling to him after. He 'fails the test' and in doing so proves his 'humanity.'

4. When she says ""I've been to a lot of weddings"", Niles says something sarcastic and insinuating like ""you don't know the half of it"" or ""we can only imagine"" and she doesn't remark on this.
5. She somehow found the location of the portal in the middle of the desert by herself and never communicates as such throughout the whole movie?

It was also fucking nasty (like, I expected it; it's a war film after all) but stuff like Will accidentally placing his hand on a decaying corpse and ending up touching its intestines did catch me off guard and got an audible reaction out of me and several other moviegoers. 

However, all of that also meant that the quiet and tender moments stood out so much more. From Will meeting the French woman and the baby to the soldier singing for everyone and making them forget about their situation for a second, it was really beautiful to see and it gave you that tiny bit of hope you needed.

And then of course, the cinematography, which was the main reason I wanted to catch this movie in theaters - and my god, was it breathtaking. They really made it seem like it was filmed in one shot and it added so much to the viewing experience and constant paranoia. I also never had the feeling like I was missing something.

68033,"On my third rewatch, I noticed something interesting: Mia turns off a lamp at the end of her play. She does this when she performs it for the first time in her bedroom for Sebastian, and on the night of the actual performance. However, in the final dream sequence, Mia leaves the lamp on.

Now, here's the significance behind this. Consider the title of Mia's play - ""So Long, Boulder City"". Based on what we know about Mia, it can be presumed that the play is a reflection of her life (leaving home to pursue her passion for acting in Hollywood).
Going off of this, I believe that Mia turning off the lamp at the end of her play is symbolic of her doubts that she is meant to succeed as an actress, which foreshadows her move back home (note that Mia's interaction with the lamp is the only part of her play that we see in the movie).

The evidence to support this comes in the dream sequence, which imagines what might have happened between Mia and Sebastian, had their relationship worked out perfectly. It is in this perfect world, where Mia does not doubt herself, and her acting dreams. Therefore, the play she writes that is based on her life, is a play based on this perfect world.

And it is in this perfect world, rather than turn the lamp off, Mia keeps it on.",1

The visuals and editing are amazing - I can't believe that all of these anime-faithful fight scenes were made in this, and even if I'm not a big cyberpunk fan appreciated the action. I just wished it kept a little more of the dark humor of the original.

I get the whole Romeo and Juliet motif with young, dumb love set in New York City with racial tensions, but I was just out after her brother got murdered. I kind of rolled with it until then and mostly suspended my disbelief but I couldn't get over how she had a reaction for about 12 seconds before moving on with her life. And then follows it up by sleeping with the same guy hours later and then having the gall to make excuses about how much she loves him to Anita who just came back from identifying Bernardo's body. Word? This guy you met two nights ago with the charisma of a dead fish who just killed your brother?  How are you going to be singing about true love and all this garbage to a woman who just had her lover murdered, your brother, and is rightfully distraught? I just checked out after that. 

Aside from storyline issues that were just going to be endemic to a retelling of this story, I just could not get over how bad a casting job they did with Ansel Elgort as the lead. Other actors and actresses on this production could really sing and dance their asses off and were electric in scenes (Bernardo, Riff, and Anita especially) while this guy was really flat and had nearly negative charisma in most scenes. It felt kind of like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables for me. I just did not buy him as a Romeo equivalent at all, could not understand why she'd fall head over heels in love with THIS guy in specific, and just felt like he couldn't emote effectively at all. He was basically as flat as a thumb to me, I do not understand the appeal at all. I think this could have been much elevated with a better leading man, but Elgort just wasn't it at all. Horrible casting choice. 

Beautifully shot and mostly well acted (aside from Elgort), but you definitely felt that it was 2.5 hours long with how much it dragged on. And I'm a person that tends to like musicals but ultimately I just don't think this story was all that great, it was a bit too sappy for me, and the characters of Tony and Maria just took me out of it. And before anyone jump in with ""well it's Romeo and Juliet!"" I've always felt that R&J, compared to his other works, is one of the weaker stories penned by Shakespeare.

I loved that the ""bad guy"" ""won"" here. I think it is fairly obvious that the classic  cast is going to end up trading themselves for the new next generation cast somehow, but still was emotional to watch so many heroes die on screen.

The thing I think Bo did so well in this scene is play with the idea of putting yourself out there.

It shows just how hard it is for middle schoolers (or really anyone) to know, is this a good uncomfortable or a bad uncomfortable.

If that scene would've happened with Gabe, it could've come across as pleasantly, cringily relatable. Many people have fond memories of their awkward first sexual encounters with their peers that were *not* predatory. Both parties were kind of uncomfortable, but it was also exciting.

70126,"Saw this on Saturday and knew I would love it. I didn't know I'd love it so much though!

The discrimination theme was fresh and interesting and the characters were all cast perfectly and sometimes hilarious. The little Fennec Fox had me in tears when he spoke and every exchange between Judy and her parents gave me a good laugh. ""Oh, thank God! She's a meter maid!""

Bateman and Goodwin carried the story and had wonderful chemistry. The world was interesting and catered to each animals' needs perfectly. Much like Bojack, the animals exhibited personality traits like animals do in real life. The attention to detail was superb and the animation top notch.

The song ""Try Everything"" had a great message, which I felt was touched on throughout the movie. There was plenty of action and a few  really well thought-out jokes. I especially liked the reference to Breaking Bad in the train car.

If anyone has images of the bootleg movies that the Weasel was selling, I'd love to see them! I caught glimpses of them and they all seemed hilarious.

The movie made me very emotional and even though I knew what was going to happen since I’m familiar with the source material, I was still at awe at how wonderful the film was. Very well-done.",1
3371,Loved the audio and camerawork in the opening attack scene...the contrast in character POV and escaping was really refreshing,0
54406,"It was a fun dramedy. I'm a late 20s male but still found it watchable. Bit predictable? for sure. The gay boyfriend, the asshole cool group, the best friend reunion for prom. But just because it is predictable doesn't mean it isn't realistic. I found it well done, and very nostalgic. The strongest aspect of this movie is the cast; Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf , Lucas Hedges, Tracy Letts, Beanie Feldstein were all really well casted.

Her father and the adopted brother's gf may have been my favourite characters overall. The mom, although passive aggressive, was a good mother at the end of the day. My mom was a lot like her. I always thought that was more because we came to Canada as refugees and she grew up in a different culture/time. I wouldn't say she was as 'evil' or 'abusive' as others have on here. In fact, I sort of was on her side as the movie went on. Basically just the regular battle between generations. To be truly abusive, I need some alcohol/drug abuse, some physical violence, some actual malevolence, not a mother who takes her daughter shopping, sews her prom dress, etc.  

Overall it isn't some kind of generational masterpiece, but to me, it was a nice look into someone's life, and a solid 7/10. Basically you're a fly on the wall of a teenager going through struggles and ascending into adulthood. Sort of reminded me of Edge of Seventeen and Boyhood. ",1

54318,"First off, I loved this film. I'm late to the game since it took forever to come out in the UK but it was fantastic. Between this and Get Out for film of the year for me. I could have watched Lady Bird for another three hours easily. I thought this film was everything Boyhood was praised for, yet didn't deliver on in my opinion. One thing I found interesting was that although she was cruel, Laurie Metcalf's character was right about Lady Bird, she was selfish, and did only think about herself. The characters in her life were all going through their own personal battles, her ex dealing with his sexuality, Timothe Chalamet's character dealing with his father's cancer, her mother's abusive upbringing, her father's depression, her bestfriends weight issues and unrequired love for a teacher, her brothers post-college plateau and his girlfriend's family abandonment, Lady Bird rarely pays notice to those around her and her sympathy for them is often fleeting. That theme that everyone is fighting their own battles, but is forced to deal with them alone and hide them from a society resistant to difference or outbursts of emotion played so effectively. And despite Lady Bird's narcissim, what I found the most resonant was that this was really fine for a 17 year old, and her mother just couldn't understand that she was still a child who was allowed to be selfish and need affirmation, she was exhausted by her daughter's selfishness but Gerwig presents Lady Bird to the audience in a way that encapsulates the idea that you have to let a 17 year old be there hormonal, selfish, anxious self. Worked brilliantly. ",1

>Vic was shitty, and yet he didn't take the opportunity to kill the main character in his sleep. So he should have stooped below his level at that point?

Absolutely. It's selfish not to do so. It would mean putting your own conscience above the well being of other people.

Jesus - it was ok to screw with people's lives with a secret research experiment in the united states only 50 years ago?  That doesn't hold water.  These people - especially Neubaur - were messed up.  I would still like to know what they were trying to learn.  When they revealed that first placing a single adoptee into the families a few years prior to the separated twins being placed there was a part of the experiement it showed  how mind-numbingly manipulative of everyone involved they were.

We're set up to believe he's going to reveal how much fucked up stuff he's done at the hotel, but after the movie is over as far as we know all he's done there is film people for ""management"" and his sins were from the fucked up shit he did in the war.

One was when Affleck was speaking to his ex-wife about Hedges's character being okay because ""he doesn't really open up to me, but he has a lot of friends, so I think he's okay."" Which was true, Hedges really leaned on his friends to maintain a sense of normalcy during his bereavement, and they were constant throughout the film. 

Then consider the scene where Affleck steps into the office if his former employer (I think?) to ask for shifts, and the guy's wife comes around the corner and tells him she doesn't want to see Affleck again. Affleck's character had no support from anyone but his brother. The rest of the town really seemed to turn on him. They left him to mourn alone.

It all sort of culminates for me when they're playing ball at the end of the film. Affleck tells him to let it go, and Hedges refuses. Two very different responses to tragedy, with two very different sets of support structures surrounding them. ",1

I say give me that end moment to cry and to focus on what the film was about for those men in that time.  Of course it’s more complicated than just opposing the Vietnam war, as the movie showed, but for me it worked.

59784,"I really enjoyed the movie, although a lot of that is probably nostalgia. 

I thought Luke Evans absolutely killed it as Gaston, I liked the whole war hero backstory, and I thought he made Gaston more malicious and unlikeable than the original. I loved 'Kill the Beast' - probably my favourite part of the film. I thought Josh Gad did a good job too.

Emma Watson's singing was far too autotuned, to the point where it didn't sound human anymore, which sucks for a character who is meant to be...well...so humane. I'm a big HP fan, and of course she plays the book-loving side to Belle well, but there is much more to the character than that, so it's not really enough to justify it.

I thought that Belle and the Beast went from really disliking each other to having feelings for each other pretty quickly. The 'Days in the Sun' song made Belle fall for Beast faster than expected, I thought they could have just focused on their friendship a bit more before making them fall in love. I'm not sure the changed structure of the library scene worked either. In the original, the Beast quite obviously does it as a kind gesture as his feelings are starting to develop, whereas in this he sort of begrudgingly shows her it, it felt less romantic somehow. 

Also, I liked Ian McKellen, who of course did justice to the role, and had some great one liners. Good chemistry with Lumière as well (although his accent felt a bit off).

All in all, really enjoyed the film, Luke Evans was the star for me, but some issues with singing and character development.",0
14897,"Honestly, this movie is downright scarier than most horror films and more depressing than almost any movie I've ever seen. Not even in a balling your eyes out sort of way, moreso in the sense of utter hopelessness and the inevitably of the situation. It's a really good and well acted movie, but while  I can go watch something like Schindler's list or Come and See once a year and enjoy them, I honestly would feel  much more unpleasant going back to watch this again.",1
75806,"This movie is absolutely amazing. It feels so alive and full of love, every character really comes to life on-screen. The fact that they all feel so real and alive when all they are is little puppets in a warehouse in Oregon is amazing. I honestly can't even believe stop-motion is a thing that can be this good. The amount of hard work, talent, and dedication needed to pull something like this off is extremely admirable.

But it would be pointless if the story or filmmaking was weak, and again Laika shows that they know what they are doing in that department. Not a single scene or second is wasted here. While it's basic plot is a pretty typical heroes journey, the characters, environments, poetic and gorgeous imagery, and the themes that were explored really elevate it well-beyond feeling anything close to cliche or recycled.

A lot of kids movies have got mile-a-minute storytelling, lots of pop tunes and upbeat music, flashy visuals, and are full of lame, lazy jokes. While some movies like that are decent and enjoyable, it was so great to see an animated ""kids"" movie that really respected the entire audience. While there are a lot of great jokes, action scenes, and it moves pretty quickly Kubo is a movie that isn't afraid to go to some dark places, or give some time to let the emotional scenes sink in. The kids in my audience were into it.

While some will write it off just because it's an animated movie, I think there really are some genuinely thoughtful and touching ideas explored here. The power and importance of storytelling, the nature of memory and loss, and even life and death are all touched upon and included in a natural and fitting way. I think this film has more on it's mind that a lot of adult dramas I've seen recently.

This movie has better action scenes and more imagination than any other big action blockbuster I've seen this year. I'm not sure what kind of research went into this, but it felt like an authentic portrayal of Asian culture, and made me want to learn more about it. 

I also loved how there weren't any exposition dumps about Kubo or his mother and their magic. He just played his instrument and the paper came to life. It was a confident and bold decision to introduce us and say ""yeah, he's magic, here's what he does, now let's get on with it."" Bold and confident are both adjectives I'd use to describe the film as a whole. The film had a very clear and unique sense of identity and purpose, and kept consistent the whole way through.

There are so many images in here that will be burned into my memory, particularly that scene where Kubo was underwater and there were all those giant eyes staring at him. This is one of the most gorgeous movies I've seen in so long, and I can't wait to see it again. Even the 3D was utilized well, something that I usually hate.

If I ever have kids, this will be a movie that I cannot wait to show them. I loved and adored everything about it. This is about as close to a perfect movie as you can get. My favorite of this year so far.

1645,"The ending is even more complex and sinister than one might realize.  Peter of course finds way to get rid of Phil in the end, but his earlier actions beg the question, has he killed before?  Early on, Peter states it’s his duty as a son to protect his mother, this comment seems well thought out.  A few examples of the duplicity of the act that follow. 

In the first rabbit scene, Peter surprises us by killing what we believe is a beloved pet in the name of science. While out riding fence with Phil, we get a (second!)  rabbit death, this one a mercy killing.  Immediately afterwards,  Phil berates Peter’s mom for being an alcoholic, to which Peter replies “she never used to drink”. Peter goes on to tells Phil that father was an alcoholic and died from suicide by hanging-from a rope. Peter tells Phil that he found his father and cut him down, implying an act of mercy.  Peter tells Phil his father worried he wasn’t kind enough, was too strong.  To this Phil replies “he got that all wrong”.  Maybe Phil has it all wrong?  We get an ominous glance from Peter. One can imagine a backstory between Peter and his father, an alcoholic surely unkind to Peter’s mother.  Peter shows no loss for his dad.

Soon thereafter, Peter finds an opening to kill Phil with the diseased hide, and solves a problem for his mother.   Again with a rope.  The manner in which he lures in Phil is so premeditative as to suggest this isn’t his first rodeo.  

We next find Peter reading a Psalm, one he immediately locates in his bible as though he’s read it before. Peter certainly delivered his “soul from the sword” and his darling (mother) “from the power of the dog”.   Again.  

Finally, Peter is seen caressing the rope.  He carefully places it under the bed as though he may need it yet again another day. As George kisses his mother, he smiles believing that he may in fact be delivered from the sword.",1

Regardless, in a movie where the hero does magic via playing a shamisen, making a point of him grabbing on to and keeping one of his mother's hairs might as well have been a flashing neon sign saying ""He'll use this as a string later.""

To me, it was way out of left field and it seriously was a slap in the face to Winston (my personal favorite character). I loved the ""civility"" of the hotel rules from the first one, and John breaking the rule was unnecessary...I mean, c'mon, he's John Wick. Santino couldn't have stayed in that hotel forever.

I hate how Winston has to be an antagonist now. Winston and John obviously have a lot of respect for each other.

Here's how I would have liked it to go down:

John gets to the hotel and sees Santino and Winston.
Santino says his smug shit.
John looks at Winston, recognizes the rule, and looks back to Santino and says something along the lines of ""You can't stay in this hotel forever.""
John turns around and starts to walk away.
Santino, realizing he's trapped in a cage, draws his gun to shoot John in the back.
Winston draws his gun, shoots and kills Santino.
John, turning around and realizing what happened, looks at Winston with a ""what happens now.""
Winston smiles, and says something along the lines of ""I think the owner of this establishment will give me a pass."" (Which would have been great, because he is the owner/the maker of the rules).

Would love your guys's thoughts (good and bad). Sorry for the rant, turned fan fiction.

I just really didn't like how that ending played out. Making John Wick, THEE John Wick, break the rules in order to get his guy, sort of demystifies the strength and power of him. It showed that even he couldn't do the job without breaking a rule. ",0

The sketch goes in circles, and it's not about the plot of the sketch, but instead the meaning and humor that derives from the experiences. So the sketch ""Who's on first"" is an absurdist comedy version of the communication  method and perception of time that the aliens and eventually Louise possess.

I think it’s this more than anything. He’s been pushed around by Howard nonstop since the start of the movie and after being locked in that box for ~two hours he just did it. The very next thing he says as Arno starts framing out is “I can fix this,” which to me suggests he just did something he didn’t really mean to do and now needs to find a way out. They start smashing cases next to grab whatever they can, but they’re not getting out — so much of the movie has established that you can’t get out of that store without someone buzzing you out. After they shoot Arno there’s two of them and no way out of the store, so I really think shooting Howard was never something he planned or thought through.

It starts out seeming like all the others just a story about some people but what's unusual is that the mustached man occasionally glances directly into the camera at the viewer.  Then when night falls the man stares prolonged, directly into the camera as he talks about loving to distract people with his stories.  At that moment we feel like we're all in the carriage, watching a story to distract us with some kind of meaning that we derive only from experiences in our own lives while death is always sneaking up to thump us unexpectedly; all while we are distracted from our mortality (""I live forever"").  I think the bit about whether or not people ever find meaning in it all is kind of a nod to the previous stories.  None of them have any clear meaning.  At least that's the eerie feeling I got from it.

The Cohens seem to love nihilistic themes.  Like with The Meal Ticket.  The orator has no real personality outside of his performances.  He just stares speechless, neither happy nor sad.

Watched the first one, enjoyed it for what it was, even ignoring the holes, like no one hearing the gunshots, the screaming, or why he hid under the house instead of just leaving?

The second one just took large dumps on the originals story. 

1. It was clearly more than 2 years, had to be for multiple reasons. Why not just say it was 4 or 5? 

2. No one believes Cole? Even if Bee had super natural abilities to clean in a hurry, how do you explain away the cops, the sacrifice? 
Also, what’s the point of it? Cole would have had all kinds of mental trauma that could be used as a catalyst to say everyone thinks he’s crazy/disturbed/not cool.

3. Melanie. What the hell? Even if you wanted her to turn, why be so lazy with it. *Poof* now she’s evil, because followers. Could have given 100 reasons that would have made enough sense for her to murder her bestie. No indication she ever cared about being popular, I mean, she had a crush on the dorkiest kid at school. 
Or, they could have made it so they had drifted apart over the years and changed, not that she’s still his best friend, video calling him same as always. No mention of how they were supposedly in puppy love? Just didn’t happen and now she’s with a jock. That’s also fine, but at least explain that they tried being more than just friends and preferred being besties. Or maybe she became obsessed with what happened that night and got deep down the cult rabbit hole.
The bully, who appeared to have lost his friends and his bike because of Cole, seemed like a much better choice as a new big bad who was dead set on destroying him.

4. Lastly, Bee. I can cop a change in the back story. Replacing “strong and confident” with “I had to save someone I love who I put in hospital” it’s lazy, but I didn’t buy “strong and confident” from a leggy 6ft blonde woman anyway.
But the whole “you changed me that night” is instantly undone by the fact Bee clearly recruited his bestie after that night. Could have picked anyone, why Melanie if you give a shit about Cole? Also, if getting him laid was the plan, surely the easier path was with Melanie anyway?

Also, Kate is 28 in 2017, meaning that that she was 12 in 1999. Why, as an adult, does she speak Croatian \[the Netflix subtitles alternative between calling it Croatian and Serbo-Croatian\] with a thick English accent?

The opening scene of the novel was one of the most tense and well directed scenes I've seen all year. Michael Shannon and Jake Gyllenhall were fantastic. However, I found the storylines outside of the novel to be extremely melodramatic and uninteresting. [The amount of shots to Amy Adams crying over sweeping violin was borderline parody](#spoiler). Also, [the dinner scene between Adams and Gyllenhall had some of the worst expository dialogue I can remember](#spoiler). The opening credits scene was a misstep as well, I could hardly take the film seriously after that. I'm wondering if Tom Ford's intention was a satire on the art scene with Amy Adams present day storyline. Overall, I'd give a 6.5/10. Great acting and style, but very thin layer of substance. ",0

26854,"My good Ford V Ferrari is such an Epic racing car movie. I watch Dolby and the sound effects so great. It helps to get emerged in the film and feels part of the race. 

Christian Bale's performance is one best of the year so far and deserves Oscar nomination. Bale embodies Ken Miles, and he is so in the role. 

Caitriona Balfe, as Moline Miles, is traffic, and she has excellent chemistry with Bale. Matt Damon is good, but not on the same level as Bale or Balfe's performances. 

I feel that Jon Bernthal was underutilized through half the movie. His character becomes forgotten when the plot moves on. A little is a bit more of him. 

The writing is excellent. It balances humor and drama well. An Exmaple is when Moline saw Ken leave with Carroll, and she wants him to confess where he was last night. She was driving cazy and that shit hilarious but still dramatic. 

My favorite moment is when Ken almost finishes line, but he slows down. I like how it was directed as it jumps cut from him to his rear mirror. The camera lingers in the closet, and he realized that going alone isn't great because you can't share it with anybody. 

In general, Ford V Ferrari is in my top 5 of the year. I love this movie.",1

Anyways. 

The form they take is like cubism. In cubism artists try to step beyond the theory of forms to represent a subject from as many viewpoints as possible. 

The being we cannot comprehend is smashed into a form that is every possible view of the form itself. The object without form, is represented by being every form.

I read the reason the creators decided to do that was because comic books, or at least older comic books don’t have blur and bloom effects.

18722,"This film blew my mind. So often in the quarantine era I’ll find myself kinda half paying attention to movies or browsing my phone while watching, but this one held my absolute attention from start to finish. As a white guy, I truly appreciated just hearing the different opinions and viewpoints on the civil rights movement, since the topic is obviously still largely at play in today’s society. It didn’t hold your hand and say “see, we can be equal and unite” (Remember the Titans and Green Book come to mind), but it was a brutally honest look at how even people at the top of their respective crafts experienced life (I know it’s factionalized, but just from a story standpoint). I was captivated on just hearing these men discuss the movement and their roles. I like how none of them told any really specific racist horror stories. It didn’t need that to be impactful, just their thoughts.

While the center point of the film is that brilliantly two-sided argument between Sam and Malcolm, the highlight scene for me was when Jim Brown finally shared his true feelings on how the people who pretend they aren’t racist because they’re not in your face about it and pat themselves on the back for it are worse than stereotypical, borderline caricature racists. Incredibly thought provoking, it reminds me of all those “I’m not racist, I have a black friend” jokes. It helps me realize that there are so many types of experiences and different ways for racism to seep in, and there’s a constant, ongoing battle against it. I recognize that I can’t fully understand these characters’ viewpoints without experiencing similar things myself, but I really appreciate opportunities like this to learn more about it.

Some other highlights: Sam’s performance at the end with the visuals of the other three continuing their own respective lives (I thought it was going to end with showing Malcolm’s murder, but I think ending with his quote was fitting). I love the scene where Sam admits his insecurities about his career and how Dylan’s song affected him, it was the cherry on top of his argument with Malcolm and I think it made Sam the most compelling character, as the whole film up to that point showed he had an anger beneath the surface. And the performances! Really hope we see noms for both Ben-Adir and Odom Jr, their portrayals of the vulnerable side of these larger than life figures were mesmerizing. I can’t wait to watch it again, I feel there is so much more to take in from it

65959,"A lot of people seem to be missing out on the fact that she doesn't really have a choice - she becomes aware of *the* future, not a potential one. She was always going to go through with it. 

I highly reccomend everyone read the original story. This was a fantastic adaptation (probably the best story/book to film adaptation I've seen in terms of balancing the ideas and best parts of the story with improvements/changes to fit the visual medium) but the story, by nature of the format, is able to explain a bit more about the perception of time thing. Essentially, the value of life with the perception of all time at once comes not from making ""choices"" but rather it is acting upon what will happen that imbues it with meaning. That said, she/they still seem to experience time linearly, just with awareness of the future as if it was a memory. ",1

69330,"I just watched it a little earlier today and have given myself time to calm down after that insane Vader boner. I'll try to keep my comments short but there's so much I enjoyed.

I have to say I was *extremely* satisfied with Rogue One. The cinematography was good, almost beautiful at some points (a scene only a few seconds long with a squadron of x wings gliding through the gate 'ship' and seeing the turquoise planet underneath was gorgeous). The locations were all very interesting and enjoyed their varied environments. I like the opening scenes of the villains (forget his name now, Kessic?) white cape against the black sand and bright green crops. 

Looking back I'd say the weakest bit was the cave scene with Forest. But it was short and with that escape from the planet I had nearly all but forgotten about it.

I loved how they chose to show the rebellion in a darker, more muddy light. They had to do some nasty things to survive and get the information they needed. And the scene where Jynn says goodbye to her father after he is injured from the *rebellion* attacks - very sad and makes you wonder if the
Alliance are all that 'heroic'

The villain was top notch, he was just a bloody bastard hoping to work his way up the ranks and be the best bastard he could. His death was very good, having him look up to see his very creation (and pride) staring down at him. 

I also like that the last 'fight' wasn't just Jynn and Kessic duping it out like in a lot of other action movies. Those can be very dull a lot of the time.

I also like how they didn't kiss at the end. There wasn't any 'romance' between them for the entire movie and trying to squeeze in a kiss would have just felt forced and odd. Instead they have a good companionship knowing together they helped give the rebellion a chance the end the empire. 

All supporting characters that made up rogue one where also nicely done, had a nice few laughs from them. K2's one liners were great.

Battle of Scarrif, top notch, no faults from what I can remember. Loved seeing the ATAT appear out of the smoke.

And then the ""oh no, the star destroyer has gone down, I hope he doesn't end up bumping into the other one"" then the freaking hammer head appears - ""prepare for impact!"" 
Oi boi he 'bout to do it! *smash kaboom*

But holy shit, the glistening cheery on top of that star war cake had to be the hallway scene with Vader. Just how the rebels turn to see dark, black smoke billowing out of the end of the hallway. Suddenly, the breathing starts. ""Oh shit"" you think. This is it, you can feel the pure terror in the rebel soldiers as they stare down the corridor. Then he's just illuminated entirely in the red glow of his light sabre, giving him probably the most evil appearance ever. 
Then he just utterly destroys them, making his way to the very last soldier holding the rebellions only hope! There's so much urgency. So much was sacrificed to get those plans don't fuck it up now!

Ugh I need to go calm down again. Would happily watch again, probably most favourite star wars movie yet.",0
15942,"As someone who has done some analog film projections from 35mm film over the past years, I was really excited about the cue marks. If only the cue marks, you'd see in a real 35mm film copy would always be that clearly visible :D

I didn't really pay attention to the frequency of the marks, but they seemed pretty correct (every \~22 min). The reel switch was also mostly between scenes, although the reel length didn't really affect the act structure of the film, like it often did back then. I also really geeked out about the first simulated projector switch being slightly wonky and the noise around one of the later cue marks. The last few seconds of a film reel tend to have significantly more scratches and specks, since this is the part of the film reel, which is handled the most, when the film is being prepared for the projection (e.g. spooled onto the projector spools) and also because the spool rotates the fastest at the end of the reel.

Fincher payed a lot of attention to those small details which made me happy as an occasional projectionist :)",1

Luckily it was remastered for the bluray release so the version of the movie that exists now is totally fine, but it does mean that you can't go back and experience just how awful it was.

Like everyone else has stated, the launch and tension when the jets fire up is intense.  They also use this angle of the rocket climbing into the sky in slow motion, which was simply amazing and you feel like you are really there (which begs the question, why did they keep cutting away to crowd shots instead of just following the progress of the rocket?).

Another scene I enjoyed immensely was probably within the first 15 minutes when you see the faces of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins in such great detail.  Their expressions of confidence mixed with a bit of pensiveness is absolutely compelling.

I do see how one could fall asleep during this movie, as the mission control voices are a bit of an effort to follow, and a little too technical for casual viewers.   

Nonetheless, seeing this mission in such great detail and looking at the sheer amount of technical expertise from NASA to make this happen is just dumbfounding.

Though it doesn't quite have the narrative depth or same amount of colorful characters as Rocknrolla. Probably my biggest complaint about the movie, is that I never really felt that the main characters or their organization were ever in any real trouble. It felt like they just had the situation under control and were always a hundred steps ahead of their rivals at every turn. What I appreciated about Rocknrolla, is that there's a real sense of uncertainty and flux within each of the gangs/criminal factions as the plot progresses and they all try to come out on top over each other.

&#x200B;

Comparatively, i didn't really feel like there was much in the way of real consequence for anything that happened in The Gentleman and that diminished the journey a bit on my end.  On the positive end, Collin Farrell and Hugh grant essentially dominated every scene they were in and their characters were easily the highlights of the movie.

&#x200B;

For me the Gentleman would get a solid 7-7.5/10. It does its job well enough, but could have been stronger in some areas. Ritchie has yet to top Snatch & Rocknrolla for me.",0

57727,"No we're not told how much a movie is going to be censored or cut. Though sometimes movie theaters mention in their instagram posts the amount of time that has been cut from movies. 


Mostly nude, inappropriate clothing, sexual, and kissing scenes are the ones to be cut from movies. But also anything that contradicts with our culture, offends conservative people, may be inappropriate for children, or risks the stability of the country gets censored. 

 I'll mention some movies that were censored and you'll probably figure out why. 

• A scene in Ex Machina discussing whether being gay is a choice or not was cut. 

• Beauty and the Best was banned because of some gay scene

• All mentions of Superman being like a god were cut from MoS and BvS

• The plot of Fast7 revolved around a program named the Eye of God, the word God was censored everytime a character said the name of the program (basically God is censored if the name isn't used to refer to God himself)

• Scenes in 2012 depicting rich arab people were cut entirely from the movie. 

• Drax talking about his nipples and Ego's penis was cut from the movie. A scene where a lady in gold asking Chris Pratt to teach her how babies are made is also cut. 

• I remember a movie named Triple 9 had an Israeli-Russian guy in it. Some scenes mentioning Israel were cut. 

• Obviously any negative depiction of Arab governments is cut from movies. 

• Any scenes from Suicide Squad that had Harley's butt appear on screen were zoomed in to not show her butt. 

• Some local TV shows wanted to discuss minority oppression. The government didn't want this to be shown on TV or for these scenes to even be shot in the country so the director went to another country just to shoot these scenes and had his show on some other non-local channel. Government got pretty pissed but nothing happened. 

• Baby Kal El was cut from MoS because his penis was showing. 

• WonderWoman was banned because Gal is from Israel and because of religious themes as well. 

• For some reason MacGregor vs. Mayweather fight was banned. 

• The scalping scene from Inglorious Basterds was cut. 

• Scary scenes from the first Annabelle movie were cut as well. The movie basically became a comedy movie and everybody was just laughing the entire time. All we were able to see was characters reacting in fear to nothing. 

• I think one of the Purge movies were banned

Sometimes scenes aren't censored or cut but the subtitles are changed. 
For example in some movies god is translated to ""Sky"" in the subtitles. 

The ""tickle your pickle"" line from IT was translated to something about eating pickles",0

Knowing Sorkin's politics going into the film, I knew the essential points that were going be made. I was NOT however, expecting an internal dialogue about frictions and in-fighting on the left (VERY relevant nowadays). What’s more important; playing the part until you can ascend the hierarchy enough to dismantle the system, or seeing the bigger picture and shaping hearts and minds to change the psychological landscape? The film did a great job of highlighting these different ideologies accurately, as well as making it clear that whilst one attitude is more sensible and agreeable, the other is a lot sexier and more immediately appealing. Ultimately though, these two voices have to come to an understanding and unite in the face of their common enemy (taking the form of the ‘thug’ judge). It takes a healthy mix of both idealistic and pragmatic thinking to make change.

This struck me as the most interesting and poignant theme in this film, and perhaps Sorkin’s main angle since he knew people on the right probably weren’t going to give the film a chance:
That everyone on the left needs to put aside their moral-elitism or smug-centrism and come together as a united front. Because people on the right have a fuck of a lot less in-fighting.

22075,"I was surprised how much I liked the movie.

Very cute family movie.

Enola was a kick.  Intelligent, determined with a strong sense of perseverance.    As intelligent as she was, you could tell she was still not worldly.   She never gave a thought to the Landlady hoodwinking her for the money (convincing Enola her hole in the wall was decent lodging for London) or turning Enola in for the reward money.    I thought it was nice how she was going to open herself up to building a life at the end.  She seemed to stop using ""Enola is Alone spelled backwards"" as an anthem.   That she realizes, even though she's on her own doesn't mean she has to always be alone was a nice message.   Hope to see she and Sherlock eventually bond.

Sherlock, I liked HC's interpretation of the character.  We rarely see him so gentile and I thought that made an interesting version.   It was easy to tell Sherlock's default setting is detached but that he wanted to connect to Enola and felt for her not knowing why their mother left without her.  He isn't use to being overly concerned with anyone other than himself but he was genuinely trying with Enola

Mycroft was a little one-note but under his icey demeanor, I believe he cares about his siblings, while simultaneously being jealous of both.

Tewksbury was a nice counter to Enola.  He was more worldly/savy in some ways and proved to be resourceful in his own right.   By the end of the film I had no issue believing he would be so attached to Enola.

GrandMother Tewksbury - I didn't see coming.   What a truly dark character hidden beneath a benign surface.   What she was willing to do to her own family just to keep the status quo was shockingly sinister, considering this is a kids movie.

Eudoria Holmes - Mixed feelings about the kind of person she is.  I don't doubt she loves Enola, but she did abandon her, without explanation.  As intelligent and capable as her daughter is, she still has a lot to learn.

I hope they make a sequel.",0

> “Even the visual development drawings we had done and stuff, based on drawings of people in the South Pacific…it just seemed right for this character to have her look like she could physically hold her own for what kind of stunts we wanted her to do, and the physicality of the role,” Musker said.

> “And certainly some of the women involved in the film, our producer and some [others], were very supportive and more involved in that as well — pushing, ‘Let’s not have her be a wasp-thin woman. Let’s have her be a more realistic body shape and feel like she’s not going to be blown over by a strong wind,’” Musker recalled.

> “[Moana] goes through a lot, one thing after another,” Clements added. “She has to hold her own against Dwayne Johnson,” who plays Maui, the demigod who accompanies Moana on her adventure.

25029,"My initial interpretation was that Jake was suffering from early Alzheimers/Dementia, he's losing track of his memories and is contemplating ending things because he saw how badly his father suffered. 

Jessie Buckley was Jake's wife or girlfriend, he can't remember anymore. He can't remember how they met which is why we're given multiple versions of their first encounter. He can't remember her name which is why she's referred to as Lucy, Louise, and Ames throughout the film. He's even starting to forget what she looked like and is getting her appearance mixed with an actor (Colby Minifie from the Robert Zemeckis film). 

This would ""explain"" why Jessie Buckley's costume changes through the film and why the film appears to be set in the '70s but characters have iPhones. It's also why the dog randomly appears, and it's also why characters randomly quote poems and literature. Jake is losing track of fiction and reality. 

However, I think the interpretation that Jake is a sad, old, and lonely man who's recounting his life through the lens of his attractive ""girlfriend"" is more accurate. He basically making up all these bullshit scenarios to keep on living but deep down he realises how pathetic it is. ""I'm thinking of ending things"" refers to Jake deciding to end fantasy.",0

There's no character development, the dialogue is pretty poor (especially that ending monologue), and there's nothing really original about the premise. The mythos was there and not fully revealed, but I think we needed more of it to have investment in the mission, the characters, etc.

The creature design(s) were really cool, as were the costumes, but that's about it. I never really bought into the paranoia or claustrophobia of being that deep in the sea even though it does scare the living shit out of me in reality.

Does she normally sign?--but I have this sense of like, *this* is how you do representation. This movie didn't have to be overtly about people who use sign language (I'm looking at you, Disney). It didn't have to talk about how shitty and offensive hearing people are, or how crap society is.

9530,"I think how they portray Sandie at the end is what makes the ending good. It is too easy to tell you ""A is evil and B is great"", but that's not how real life works. We saw Sandie as a kind soul that was abused by evil men, which turned her into a broken person who eventually became a serial murderer of these evil people. She's branded forever by her deeds, to the point she's willing to murder innocent people (Ellie and John) to protect herself. She's not a rational person, she lost that when she was pimped by Jack. At the end she realizes she's become a bad person herself, that what she lived through doesn't make her immune to being the baddie too, so she takes the split second decision to die instead and let Ellie and John live.

The movie also puts us in the difficult situation where we have to choose between the assholes that raped Sandie, and Sandie who is a mass murderer and has no problem killing innocent kids. It is mean to be an ""everyone is fucked up here"" situation rather than a ""what if rapists aren't so bad??"" scene.",0

41208,"There's so many shots in this film that make you think ""How the hell did they pull this off?"" Not just the big, showy long takes, like the fire or the massacre. But the little things, too, like the reflection of an airplane framed perfectly in a puddle of water during the opening credits, or a little horned frog skittering along the ground in close-up.

This movie is filled with little touches like that, that make it feel real in every way. The way Cleo makes coffee, the way the movie theater is recreated, the way one character says to another that the Cowboys won the Super Bowl because the Baltimore Colts got cocky, then sticks to that statement even when reminded that Baltimore still won. Even the sound mix feels incredibly immersive. If you can't see this in a theater or even on a TV, make sure to watch it with headphones. This is clearly a passion project for Cuarón, and it shows.

Yes, I know I haven't talked about the story yet. It's a slowly-paced slice-of-life movie, with no big showy scenes until the last half-hour. And if you're not into that, you probably won't like it as much. But while it has nowhere near the tension of Cuarón's last two films (and really, which films do?), it's still a great screenplay about domestic life, women's struggles, class issues, political turmoil, childhood, and the movies, and that's just off the top of my head. 

If the ending didn't land for you, for me it can be summed up by the inscription that appears at the end of the credits. ""Shantih Shantih Shantih"" (please tell me if I get the following explanation horribly wrong). It's a Sanskrit mantra that also appears at the end of T.S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land"", and is a prayer used to signify the end of an Upanishad. It represents peace, rest, calmness, tranquility, or bliss. There's some big changes going on, in Cléo's life, in the family, and in the world, but everything's gonna be all right. She's at peace with everything that's happened to her over the course of the year. Shantih Shantih Shantih.",1

1) The way the movie progressed is like sleep to me, like the beginning car ride in winter lulled me into a relaxed state and then the REM stage and full on dream logic commenced. Also some elements jumped out to me like wanting very much to go somewhere or being late for somewhere and being constantly prevented (Lucy wanting to go home). Like, Ive had this kind of dream before

2) at the beginning, they were talking about writing and Jake said he was writing about this woman named Lucy who was beautiful and ideal

3) bonedog, the lines about going home  moon-landed and having special powers. The janitor was frustrated about not achieving more in life or being tied down by his farm life because he has full knowledge of what is out there, that there was more to life he missed out on. Jake even commented that it was like it was written about him. Really sad, really relatable

4) while watching it for the first time with no prior research done, I slowly realized it was happening in *a* mind, but it only dawned on me later on whose mind it was. It was *a* mind to me because the people would often talk in a similar way without reason, using the same words and phrases (for some reason some words standout sometimes like Treacherous use din different instances)",0

In fact the last thing he says is ""listen--"" but she pulls the trigger before he can explain anything.

28739,"It strays too far away from the source material. Jo while being the main character, feels over shadowed by Amy. Amy is described as someone who is rude, materialistic, and able to advance within society not because she is honest, but it is because she understand people and acts how she believes they want her to. She isn’t a bad person by any means, but this movie feels like a redemption story for Amy more than a true portrayal of the classic novel. Furthermore the story between her and Laurie is romanticized, it’s stated that while he falls in love with her eventually, he decides to propose because if he can’t have one sister, he’ll be happy with another. The actress playing Amy does so beautifully, but she is definitely not 12 or 16 the age the character is in the book. That leads me to Jo who seems weak in the movie. She isn’t a strong headed and confident as she is in the novel. This is seen with the letter she writes to Laurie and her reaction to the marriage. She’s happy for him in the book, excited that her best friend is now her brother. In the movie it looks as if she was about to cry.

Is it correct to assume the heptapods have knowledge of all of their life at all times, and thus ""live"" all moments of their lives at ""once""? 

If so, it's interesting to know that through communication, each individual can speak to any other individual of the species.

Of course, I’m sympathetic to his message but I mean it’s really disheartening to see people rationalize themselves out of how they are implicated to change their actions right now. 

I’m sure Spike Lee will be heralded as a genius filmmaker by society at large once he passes or ceases to implicate contemporary audiences.

58276,"Unpopular opinion, but I just want to offer my two cents:
Catching The Greatest Showman in the theatres was kinda a spontaneous last-minute thing for me. I saw a trailer and thought it was gonna be a typical cheesy, feel good musical kinda thing (not a bad thing, I love cheesy stuff).

I knew nothing about P.T Barnum going into the movie, but while watching it I can’t help but feel that there’s more dimensions to his character than just what’s portrayed in the musical, which was proven right after I read up on his story online afterwards.

However, I do understand that it’s a movie so we can’t expect all parts of his life events/highlights/character to be incorporated, but I was particularly disappointed with certain scenes.

For example, when Barnum decided to host a tour for Jenny Lind, the group of freaks came by to grace the event and yet Barnum shut them out in order to protect his own image and fit in with the social elites I suppose.

Suddenly fast forward a few scenes, the gang was singing and dancing at the bar with Barnum and all’s well again? Since this is a PG rated movie, I wonder what message will the younger audience take with them when they leave the theatre? I do feel this is a key issue that ought to be addressed.

As for the romance between Philip and Anne, I felt that the subplot was severely undeveloped. One moment he holds her hand, the next, she was berated by her parents, when the circus fire broke out she was seen with another guy (forgot his name) and suddenly they are together again? It was a little confusing for me and my date to watch. Overall, I do think they have great chemistry and I enjoyed their scenes. 

I would say it’s a pretty ok movie. The singing and dancing does get me hyped and I do enjoyed the movie as a whole. Perhaps if you just watched it without reading too much into it as I did, you would have a better experience.

The set of the home was an actual recreation of the director's childhood home. It's beautiful act of trying to come to terms with our memories.

The ending worked for me, but I wish that the story was about him dealing with him losing his hearing over a period of time. The opening scene had me thinking that we would be introduced to the character right in the middle (or even towards the end) of his hearing loss. But the film treats his predicament very quickly without him having any prior knowledge of some sort of hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss is a rare thing but it DOES happen, so there is a solid reasoning behind his hearing loss in the film. But it seems more fitting that a metal musician would be suffering from progressive hearing loss.

It subverted the happy ending cliches with the uppercut. Here's our moment of triumph with our hero. Here's what amounts to a modern day social media post where everyone feels great about the clever stuff you said, but the Klan is still out there and and in 2018 the same crap is happening. 

I think the point is there isn't any defeating a thing that is systemic. The main character thinks that he can make a difference and change things from the inside, but this is a conspiracy that has been running since the Civil War ended. This is the way it is designed. The people at the top of America will never allow anything more than token victories. 

Spike didn't spare White Women either. The women implicitly support the situation throughout. She eggs on her husband and cuddles him in a very motherly way, is a full co conspirator in every way and then tries to claim she was raped and plays the victim. After the boys have their little racist club meeting with the ritual of initiation there are the women. Like. Grats guys here's your sex for being good racists. 

Spike doesn't really go easy on the Black liberation movement and draws direct parallels. The problem with trying to arm up and equalize to the Klan is that the cards are stacked in their favor. You can give the same speeches and carry the same guns but the Klan has the government to shut down any real efforts. The cards are always stacked in their favor. It's is the endpoint of White Privilege. 

The entire point of the KKK wearing the hood is that it could be anyone. Don't think we are supposed to know who it is. The Civil War didn't defeat the Confederacy it just put those hoods on. All the violence from the War to the Black Liberation movement to the car full of racists being blown up doesn't mean anything. America is most home to racists and there will always be more. 

Making America Great Again is making it racist again. Spike sorta bludgeoned us with it at the end but its a topic that needs to be blunt. You can almost feel the director reaching through the screen shaking us exasperatingly to wake up. 

Smart, important film making, and I hope it means Spike is ready to use his voice more often because kids these days need to know him as more than just the dude courtside at Knicks games. ",1

First of all, not warning his wife about the zombie in the yacht because she'd be angry he put himself in danger was incredibly stupid. The chances of her trying to scope out the boat again where always going to be quite high. I'm also annoyed that she apologised to him. It was his fault. I thought they were going to have a moment where put of guilt he'd admit that he knew there was zombie there and that she'd forgive him and I'm stunned they didn't. It makes him look like an incrediblely selfish coward.

Then, the moment where she was perched under the tree and asked to end it. That would have been perfect for her. They both knew she had no hope and that way she could go out in peace, in a lovely setting, in her own mind, before she got too sick, before she's a danger to her family and maybe even with her husband and daughter in her arms.

But he then ignores her, forces her into the car, locking her in. As a result she ends up dying in a horrible situation, in much more pain and then causing harm to her family.

And then he had multiple chances to kill Vic which he didn't take. He saw that he was enslaving people for bait and in spite of that, in spite of having a loaded rifle and Vic's trust and thus the opportune moment to kill this horrible person, he decides he's satisfied for this man and his sex slave to raise his daughter. And then, again, he had a chance to kill Vic in his sleep and he didn't take it, resulting in Lorraine's death.

Lastly he makes no attempt to stop a man from a triple murder homicide. He doesn't even try to dissuade him, he just walks away; not his problem. ",0

- Georgie's arm getting ripped off was shown in full, more bloody. Likely cut to avoid an NC-17 rating
- Rock fight was longer
- Henry Bowers murders Belch and Victor. EDIT: Specifically, there was apparently a short scene of Bowers approaching the Neibolt house. We see his car parked outside, where Belch and Victor lay in the back, throats slit.
- Richie's clown room was added in later/the final cut EDIT: The reason for this was most likely because in the book, the kids see a Teenage Werewolf film in the local theater. IT takes on this form in the Neibolt house in the book, and that's when we learn what Richie is afraid of. They likely added this because Richie needed more development of his individual fear of clowns.
- Additional Pennywise television clips
- Stan had a monologue that was cut
- Patrick's remains were shown

But there’s always something definitive that happened, even if the response is directed at the wrong person (such as Mildred thinking Dixon/police setting the billboards on fire and responding in kind). 

Based on this, it leads me to believe the rapist was actually a rapist, but not Angela’s. I’m not even sure any other character in the movie lied, so there’s no reason for me to believe a random character comes in spouting bullshit. The characters tend to be brutally honest with their words. Which is why I think the gift shop scene detracts from the film, because it’s so out of line with the rest of the movie.

After one viewing, I think one of my only complaints is that the final scene felt a little bit inelegant. The monstrous makeup, the insanely ridiculous violence, some weird camera angles and CGI. I just felt that it wasn't as effective as the first 5 chapters.

Shout out to Chairman Fred Hampton Jr. for being on set pretty much every day and correcting all kinds of misinformation, even when Warner Bros. tried to stop him (and shout out to Ryan Coogler for fighting for him to stay involved). A lot of people don't realize how different this film is due to Chairman Fred Jr. fighting battles day in and day out. A few facts I'd like to highlight that aren't necessarily presented in the film are 1) O'Neal was not the only informant, in fact it is believed that Mitchell alone had 9 others who are still not identified, and 2) COINTELPRO didn't die with Hoover, these are systemic tactics that the State utilizes to this day. Chairman Fred Sr.'s tombstone is shot up by cops regularly, and there are a number of Black Panther Party members who were targeted that are still locked up as political prisoners to this day.

From a historical standpoint it may not be perfect, but as Chairman Fred Jr. told me a few days ago, ""You can't put a shark in a fish tank"". I hope the film performs well and opens the door for future projects that can more fully flesh out the politics of the Black Panther Party (imagine a series focusing on different BPP Chapters per season!). In the meantime I look forward to the discussions of the film and strongly encourage people to research the subject. For a good start I'll recommend watching the documentaries [The Murder of Fred Hampton](https://vimeo.com/434141029) and [All Power to the People](https://youtu.be/pKvE6_s0jy0), and be sure to check out [the Judas and the Black Messiah Podcast](https://medium.com/prxofficial/proximity-99-invisible-and-warner-bros-15e4d6ac8b4c) that provides historical context from Chairman Fred Jr. and actual members of the Illinois Chapter of the BPP.",1

27113,"The main thing that annoys me about Miles being left out for Le Mans '65 in favour of American driver Bob Bondurant (Apart from the fact that in reality there were more than enough GT40's for both of them to take part) is the implication that Bondurant was forced upon Shelby by Ford. Bondurant had been part of Shelby's team since '63, and in '65 he even won the sportscar manufacturers' world championship for Shelby and Ford. I liked the scene itself though because it was great at getting us into Ken's headspace; it's true that some of the execs didn't like him, but they knew how good he was and wouldn't have stopped him taking part. They have to simplify the narrative though, and I get that they didn't want the film to take us to Le Mans until the 3rd act. Bondurant is still very much alive today actually, and I'd be interested to find out what he thinks of that scene if he's seen the movie.

To be honest there's so little of Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon in the film that I didn't really feel angry at their portrayal; they kind of just show up at the end when Miles slows down. Chris Amon before his death a few years ago said in interviews that Miles disobeyed the team's instructions to ease off and overtook McLaren, and that was what caused Ford to employ the dead heat and call off the race, because Miles wouldn't do as he was told. So he had mixed feelings about it; as a racing driver, he wanted to race, but he felt that it did sort of put things back the way they should have been had Miles obeyed instructions like all the other Ford cars did. Miles was also good friends with McLaren, and I wish they had shown Miles giving him a bear hug on the podium, even after feeling he was screwed out of the win, he didn't hold it against McLaren.

I think Miles' race engineer Charlie Agapou was one of the main consultants on the movie, and he always disputed claims that Miles disobeyed team orders, maintaining that Miles did exactly as he was told and Ford screwed him over. Really, it depends which perspective you believe; I personally think the film could have made the team orders conflict way more interesting if they hadn't turned Beebe into a cartoon villain. But it's explicitly not a documentary; they had their angle and that's what they put on screen. The big problem is that most of the people who knew what really happened are not around anymore, and so we get conflicting accounts; even the race footage isn't all that helpful as it's hard to tell which is from what lap in a 360 lap race.",1

>There was no lightswitch surprise because she was visible to the audience before the light hit her, there was never an attempt at a jumpscare for us, but a slight startle for the character in the movie, not the same thing.

In the final scenes of the movie when Rockwell has his redeeming moment of heroism and collects a precious DNA sample - the very thing McDormand said she needed at the start of the film - I was so certain I knew where the movie was going... but I was ok with it, because I wanted to see the rapist punished.

The grandfather raised his three daughters in rich, well-to-do, ""perfect"" circumstances and disowned his first daughter who married a poor swordsman for love and possibly had something to do with their deaths. The grandfather is angry that he can't take away Kubo's perception/appreciation of a life of poverty (his eye) and remove him from pain, suffering, and death. 

I don't think character change has to be a primary focus. In the end, the main character change we see is the new generation's forgiveness of previous generation's ways, and we see his entire society forgive a once bitter old man now stricken with dementia.

I know I'll eat shit for this hot take but follow me;
We've seen countless times where Dan has given short takes about Ghostbusters and the like over the years while Bill (and Harold before his untimely passing) were mum about the future of the franchise. 

Ernie actively participating in Comic Conventions, his openness to his fans and that of the franchise and poking and prodding everyone in the franchise for one more romp was what he as the living soul and flag bearer for the team deserved. More of a central role and significantly more lines also. His true love for those he worked with us so genuine and real. 

Ernie is a goddamn treasure of a human being; kind hearted genuine, loving and generally present for his fans and the public in general.

Hearing him say ""I miss you friend"" drove me to tears because of a conversation we had in Niagara Falls in 2014. ""I owe my success to my drive and want to succeed. I owe my the love that I receive to him. *points at my Harold Ramis commemorative pin*. I can only hope that WE keep his love alive""

Cleo’s daughter dying leaves her in a state of shock, but when she has to rescue her boss’s kid’s, she realizes what she has in front of her. A family that loves her. Similar to how the mom ended up kicking out her husband and selling the car, she decided to stop crying about the past and simply cut it off because her kids are what’s more important. 







They may not be Cleo’s kids but they might as well be. When she has to rescue them, she realizes that her baby should be left in the past and not shut down because she already has 4 that absolutely need her. That’s the sad but beautiful sacrifice that these workers (Cleo) go through. It might seem like she’s saying goodbye to her life goals and ambitions but she’s not. The family she works for IS her life and seeing them happy is truly what she wants because, at this point, she IS family.

The segue of “Catholics are so dramatic” leading into the sweaty Protestant preacher yelling about two paths into salvation or hell fire. The chair swap when buddy moved into the top 2 only to realize it backfired and he couldn’t see his crush anymore. The “with us or against” tension between dad and the dipshit guy who was allegedly on “his side” of religion.

Belfast as a theme was supposed to be unimportant. It took two instances of her children almost dying for the wife to realize it…

54843,"I'll have to disagree that this doesn't resemble his other work. It's a Paul Thomas Anderson film, through and through, playing almost directly towards thematic concerns that have driven almost all of his work: an attempt for substantial connection in a world that doesn't inherently provide it (*There Will Be Blood* is the antithesis of this, which, I think, is why it plays so well for most people.) This almost feels like the inverse of *The Master*, with an already defined gentleman being intertwined with an outside perspective. In both cases, however, this perspective is of a ""lesser"" class, and Alma's motivations seem to be rooted in the kind of awareness that was absent from Freddie Quell. 

The back and forth mental dance between the two feels jarring at first because their inner lives aren't directly expressed to us, which is, I think, by design. The film is narrated from a perspective who isn't the main character. We hear her words, but she isn't the one whose inner world is defined. She remains a mystery, more so than Woodcock. Her presence looms over the story, what with her fireside talk and intriguing smile (not to mention those piercing eyes), almost like a ghost. The two feel like a yin and yang by the film's end, as twisted as it may seem, but there still remains an air of mystery by that final frame, no matter how content the surface appears.",1

I wasn’t sure what was to be of this film within the first half hour or so. One thing was certain, however, this film would give meaning to the notion of “motion picture”. Every frame was first an image, still and artful. It was as if I was looking at a series of old photographs and that memories I never had were urging them to move. Cleo seemed like an afterthought to the adults, not unnoticed, but unrecognized. She made the wheels of the family turn though the children certainly did notice. Naively, I expected more between herself and Fermin. But then maybe so did she and we therefore had something in common. Her love was quick and possibly forgettable if not for the responsibility she was left behind with. Fermin has other priorities and immediately Cleo is thrown back into isolation as marketeers parade the steps around her outside the cinema. It is all white noise. Chaos surrounds Cleo and yet she ultimately seems unfazed. Her focus appears to be elsewhere. Throughout the film, she managed to stand out amongst her colorless surroundings. Interesting, as she had to do little speaking or emoting to make this possible. Perhaps it is the viewer’s own empathy that speaks for her, directing concentration. When she goes to confront Fermin, she witnesses the training he has spoken about previously. A man guides them through an exercise to demonstrate or develop power and balance. All around Cleo, people struggle with this exercise, and yet, in a silent and nearly effortless manner she demonstrates her power. Miscarriage, riots, family separation were looming in her future. Changes were due, but she would persevere. Life goes on.",1

At least I understand what others like about it after reading your post. I felt unsure if this was supposed to tell me something about how some kids grew up, because despite all the shit, the kid seemed happy. It hadn't really crossed my mind to see her as a resilient kid instead of a happy kid.

16194,"I think part of my problem is the film touches on three or four main themes that all *could* be interesting, but doesn’t really follow through and make them as dramatically interesting as they might be.

You’ve got a self destructive alcoholic working against the clock.

You’ve got a man who socialises with powerful people, while privately skewering them through his work. 

You've got a guy with political ideals seeing them squashed by those powerful people through his own industry.

You’ve got a conflict of egos between a fading older talent and a blossoming young one.

All of these could make for a good story. The problem for me is, anytime it seems like any of the threads is starting to take off and actually go somewhere, it shifts to one of the others and never really brings it all together.

The clash with Welles comes so abruptly and late in the film, it comes across as a bit of a cheap shot at him (doubly weird as the film is obviously aping his directing style).",1

* Both movies center around characters keeping themselves hidden from the world in order to protect themselves from heartbreak (by working as a janitor in Boston, no less). 
* Both main characters project a rough exterior to mask immense pain (unsuccessfully, in the end). 
* Both movies’ central relationship is an older mentor and younger mentee trying to get used to each other. 

* Throw out the Will-is-a-genius-for-some-reason plot line and the audience-friendly love story, and *Manchester By The Sea* is basically *Good Will Hunting* from the point of view of Robin Williams’ character, a man trying to tend to the well-being of his young associate while also being crippled by his inability to move on from his past marriage.

This is all to say nothing of Matt Damon's involvement as a producer, the Massachusetts setting, and Lucas Hedges' [creepily-uncanny resemblance to a young Matt Damon](http://monkeygoosemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MbtS2.jpg).

But his none reaction to the sorry just made me think that he saying ""There's nothing to say sorry too, I'm not that person anymore. I have nothing in me anymore"" he's essentially considers himself as a husk of a person. His grief is so profound it's stripped him of himself completely.

As well at the end when he tells Patrick to ""just let it go"" about the ball. Lee gives him an inch with playing with the ball and Patrick tries to get a mile but Lee just doesn't have anything else to give.

17781,"Maybe I've been a little more starved for good new movies than normal, but I fucking adored this movie. Those who don't like Sorkin, this will likely not convert you to his writing, but his directing is a step up from his first effort, and the editing alongside the other tech elements are especially sharp and easily watchable.

The main draw here is the acting and the dialogue (who doesn't love to watch witty people argue, honestly?). While a lot of people have shouted the praises of the cast, Mark Rylance was the standout for me, just being so damn watchable and easy to root for. He stands a good chance at an Oscar nod. However, he'll be duking it out with Yahya Abdul Mateen who embodies everything frustrating about this trial and how it treated Bobby Seale in so many damn good ways, and Sacha Baron Cohen who starts out a bit one note, but really makes Abbie Hoffman truly interesting, deep, and compelling. While he probably won't get awards love, Frank Langella is also so fucking good at portraying how incompetent and scary Judge Hoffman was.

I'd also like to give a shoutout to the rest of the cast who probs won't get nominations; not a single one is giving a bad performance. Michael Keaton is stealing the show in two very noteworthy scenes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is showing up to remind us how much we've missed him recently and brings a little bit more to what could be a one-note character. JOHN FUCKING CAROLL LYNCH, the Zodiac Killer himself, is there being amazing and I really wanted to say his name, alongside Jeremy Strong who had me laughing way too damn much. Finally, I've had issues with him previously, and was originally worried about him in the first third, but Eddie Redmayne playing someone so different from his usual wheelhouse was a sight to see, especially his performance in the last third.

Watch this movie, and if you're voting a certain way coming up, really look for the similarities. While some of this movie was made with those modern similarities in mind, the events of this summer could not have been predicted to be so close to what unfolds in parts of this movie. Watch it, and really think about who you're voting for.",1
2140,It’s a remake of the French film La Famille Bélier which is also very good!,1

Nyles is the stereotype 20-something man scared to grow up and leave his comfort zone of living life with no consequences. Sarah, being more matured by virtue of her more difficult life experience, is determined to leave her past behind and move forward, refusing to just waste time anymore. They escape and take the next step in their relationship by doing something scary with no safety or assurance that it will work.

Roy is old enough to realize that the day he has is perfect, and he comes to peace with it (though I am glad that he escapes in the end). I thought his scene with Nyles at his house is one of the best of the movie.",0

His reactions when Cassie tells him that she saw the video were not of someone who was genuinely in love with Cassie. Had he been, he would’ve maybe gone with Cassie to the police with the tape and/or maybe accompanied her to the bachelor party or better yet,
Let Cassie be his wedding date and let her ruin it with her presence. Instead he fake cried about how he could lose his job and family’s respect.

Then they get into this slideshow about My Lai and linger on a dead baby, I guess trying to say something about how the Vietnamese have suffered from brutality just like black people?

Then all of the sudden those same Vietnamese get brutally shot and stabbed and later killed by the dozens because gooks bad. The Vietnamese never actually kill any of the Bloods, either in the present or past: Norm gets killed by Paul, Eddie steps on a mine, and Melvin suicides on a grenade thrown by a French man (which he totally did not need to dive on anyway)

It was literally just a gag that he didn't understand the exact phrase 'inner voice,' tried something new (found it worked) and kept doing it, not that he had no concept of thinking for himself. It was like that episode of spongebob with the magic conch. He got wowed by a thing he didn't understand, it didn't mean it undid his character development or he stopped being conscious or anything. He didn't really leave Woody because his voice box said ""mission accomplished,"" he did it because deep down he realised Woody needed to go. That's why he said ""you're leaving this toy behind"" before he even pressed the button, the voice box just confirmed what he was already thinking. There really *was* no reason to follow Woody at that point. Forky would have been fine. Forky was happy in the trash, Forky was happy with Gabby, Forky was happy anywhere. Woody was going for himself. And Buzz realises this at the end when he tells Woody that Bonnie will be fine and to go with Bo.

Honestly I think there's pretty good evidence throughout all the movies that the voice module connected to each toy DOES reflect their inner thoughts. It nearly always says something ridiculously specific to the moment and Woody even speaks directly to Sid through his in the first movie.

Visually, it's Wes Anderson, you know what you're gonna get and you get it. There are no surprises, no disappointment in this aspect, it's all very solid and carefully crafted which is always refreshing even though I must admit, it does get a bit tiring and repetitive. 

The main issue is the story and how the concept itself drags the movie down. It's bold and a fun idea but in the end it doesn't work, it's just a collection of random short movies about random characters that we can't really get attached to or get invested in, the stories feel superficial yet extremely dragged out and because we keep changing, the movie feels insanely long and in the end, completely whatever. I just did not care for any of it, I didn't mind any of it either, it just felt so pointless and meaningless, almost vapid. The quirky aspect to it doesn't work and is actually pretty annoying because for that to work, the movie *has* to be funny or endearing in some way and TFD feels lifeless and extremely dry. It fails on every aspect The Grand Budapest Hotel so incredibly succeeds at. 

Kinda felt like it was just W.A. flexing his directing muscles and going all out but nothing more. I honestly got bored. 

Some stuff also really felt weird, I'm french and it's just incredibly weird to hear and see english everywhere when we're supposed to be located in a tiny french village. Why is Timothée Chalamet speaking english when everyone else is speaking french (even his parents !) ? Why is there English written everywhere in Ennui ? Idk it just doesn't make sense. Feels weird.

So many of the set pieces were just boring. I wanted to see more of that sunken tanker but it only ended up being a boring chase scene and that's it. Boring hallways and stuff aren't what Pixar should be using animation for yet thats the majority of the film.

Plus, I just didn't like how they tried to make us want to see Nemo and Marlin go help Dory because she helped them yet they get lost immediately after and do nothing except comic relief and cliche ""oh no she was our friend and you said something mean to her!"" I mean this writing felt like it should have been on the Disney Channel or something.

I also thought it was dumb how they couldn't even stick to Dory's problem. One second her memory can't hold a conversation for five seconds. Another she can talk for minutes at a time. Just didn't feel real at all.

Gorilla had the best subplot mostly because his ending song was really good. Elephant girl was mostly forgettable where's Reese Witherspoon pig was sweet. I do like that she has a husband and isn't just paired with annoying fat pig.

The visuals were better, the songs were great but it's all licensed music. Bono as Lion was pretty sweet.

49359,"The first shot of Lena cheating is a few second clip of her riding her colleague. When the movie cuts back to her, that's the moment she enters the shimmer.

At the military base, there is a cut back to Lena and Kane's home where Kane is leaving early. He brings her orange juice and sets it by the bedside table. This scene ends with Kane saying, ""I do love you Lena."" The cut back is of a cell dividing into two that Lena is looking at through a microscope. 

In the house in the shimmer where the team stays, which looks like Lena and Kane's home, Lena is looking at her own cells divide. Then a scene change to where Lena, having fucked her colleague, says that has to stop and she'll never do it again. The cut back to the house is ""You lying bitch!"" as Anya slams Lena's head with the butt of a rifle. There is a cut for a couple of seconds back to Kane and Lena's empty bed with the orange juice on the bedside on the table (so this is a reference to Kane's departure scene.) The cut back to the house has Ventress, Lena, and Josie tied up.

The final cut from the shimmer to Kane and Lena is immediately after we see ""The Lighthouse"" title screen. Kane and Lena are on the couch reading. They say ""Hey"" to each other. The body language, the way they say something as simple as ""Hey"" to each other - it's clear they're in love. They have something special. Cut back to the shimmer and Lena is doubled over crying.

There's been a few scattered comments that the affair wasn't needed to tell the story. The affair and the destruction it created? That is the story. Everything else in the movie is an exploration of that.

At its heart, Annihilation is a love story - though a tragic one. It's about love lost. Lena damages her own marriage (Ventress explicitly states how happy people do things like that, to make sure the audience gets the point) and then takes a journey to try and save it. It can't be saved though. The Kane she loved is gone.  

It has been really enjoyable reading redditors' interpretations of this film. Metaphysics, Jungian, fractals, self-destruction, depression, and more. These are amazing to read and give much to think about. Alex Garland - the director and screenwriter - was a literature writer before making movies. Like many writers, he's probably extremely well-read. The number of different influences people spot in this film are unlikely accidental. I'm going to guess Garland really, really knows his shit. This is a monumental work and, in my view, one of the most intelligent and greatest films ever created.

You know how sometimes you're talking about a great movie from decades past and think, ""It must have been insane to haves seen that in the theaters when it first came out. I wonder what that must have been like."" I suspect that 20-30 years from now, film fans will be saying that about Annihilation.",0

I genuinely sat in awe and shock at Jyn and Cassian sitting on the beach hugging and bravely accepting their fate. They sacrificed themselves for the greater good. Also Chirrut, Baze and Bodhi dying were just heartbreaking. This movie I feel as a huge Star Wars fan answered so many questions that needed answering between ep 3 and ep 4. 

Also loved the style and tone and over all look of the movie. They somehow captured the futuristic look of the prequels but kept it feeling natural and real like the originals. Bravo.

Rose is nervy and skittish, yes, but having him kill the chickens is sort of just about how Rose can be very conventionally feminine in being so skittish of getting her hands dirty. I don't think Rose fails her through these ways—she's very clearly trying her level best in the beginning & even after Johnny dies to keep them afloat and then later to marry George so Peter can go to school. And yes it sucks that she becomes so ""weak"" by folding, but she tries and tries. She's literally telling him to be kind and soft all the time (well not...literally, but that's what the monologue Dunst KILLS is really saying in both the book & film.)

Honestly I see who Peter becomes by the end as Rose's absolute worst nightmare. Goddam I really do love how Dunst played this thought. I genuinely think she captured Rose ( how in the alley she plays it like she probably-kinda knows Phil is right there, how with Peter's killing of the rabbit she has a certain nonchalance despite subsequently putting her foot down.)

I believe I remember that egg joke from an episode of the westwing from Margaret to Leo, too.

Directing was pretty good too. The story moved along well. And the framing of the story around the trial was very well done.

For cons.. I do find it dipped in intensity a little bit once Bobby Seales mistrial was called, that really felt like a bigger ""win"" than the ending. And the ending wasnt great, but to be fair the ending in real life wasnt great either. I honestly cant think of a way for the real life ending to be portrayed optimistically, maybe it shouldnt have been. But I respect Sorkin for trying, there are enough pessimists.

I checked some reviews, and apparently some people went into this expecting some sort of Fast&Furious style action bullshit? Really? Wow.

I loved the suspense. I loved the interaction. The beauty of this one was in the subtlety. Anyone can guess sort of how it will end (again, usa-vs-russia in an american movie ...), so it is the route to get there that matters.. and it was suspenseful every bit of the way.

It is one of few movies I consider excellent. There wasn't too much nudity. There wasn't too little. Same with blood, gore and death. Every single instance of blood & sex emphasized exactly how large the stakes were. Any single instance of these in this movie is worth more than a hundred deaths or romance scenes in many other movies.

49374,"MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW: Just my interpretation of the movie after a second viewing.

Just watched the movie a second time. I think I had a strange experience watching the film on both viewings. After my initial viewing, I understood the message of the movie and its themes about ""self destruction"". The idea of ""That which nourishes me also destroys me"". I understood that Lena and Kane both had to go through the destruction of the self to become anew. I didn't quite read what their hug at the end meant (let alone what happened in the lighthouse sequence). All I knew was that Kane was the alien and Lena was still herself. I was able to grasp how the psychologies of all the characters in the movie reflected their outcomes by the end of the film.

On my second viewing, I was absolutely blown away. I think I understand the larger picture Alex Garland was attempting to explain about the nature of our existence, life, and the idea of self destruction. I think there are a few key lines of dialogue that I think elevate the film towards ""the cosmic horror"" sense that is rooted in existentialism and the existence of higher dimensional beings/cosmic entities. These quotes aren't word for word, but just my recollection of it.

1. Lena in her classroom: ""All cells come from a singular organism from this planet, maybe the universe""

2. Lena and Kane in bed. ""God doesn't make mistakes"" - Kane
Lena then talks about the nature of senescence - how we think aging is natural but perhaps aging, death, and decay are actually a mutation on the cellular level that wasn't meant to be. I don't have the quote on this but this is what I read it as.

So from these two lines, I started viewing the film moreso among the lines of Alex Garland actually trying to explain the nature of our existence. Did we all truly derive from a singular organism?  Is the nature of the entity that Lena encounters in the tunnel of the lighthouse always to mutate and envelop the things that surround it? (Both living and nonliving - you can see plantlike structures/vines covered in the paint of the lighthouse, and also with the glass trees outside the lighthouse on the sand).

With the lighthouse sequence, when Lena first watches the video that was stored, we see the ""entity"" (The trippy psychedelic visuals at the bottom of the tunnel) and also ""the clone"" (By clone, I'm referring to the metallic body you see briefly in the cam footage looking through the tunnel, as well as the one Lena has an encounter with. These are both the same thing but different form). When we see Kane about to blow himself up, hes actually looking at someone behind the camera. On the first viewing, I took the dialogue as Kane speaking to the audience and super on the nose, but he is actually talking to the clone. He says:

 ""I thought I was Kane in this life. What was I before? Was I you? Were you me?""

He then asks: ""Have you ever seen a phosphorous grenade go off?"" It's pretty bright. Shield your eyes. If you make it out of here find Lena"" 

The clone(off camera): ""I will"" - Kane blows up and the alien/duplicate of Kane steps in front of the camera. Its clear to me on second viewing that Kane's motivation for going into the shimmer was because he felt like he wasn't enough for Lena. He felt he was the reason Lena was cheating on him. It's clear he still loves her, but he isn't enough for her (That's how I read his acting throughout the movie). When he looks into the entity, I think he has the vision about the nature of our existence and also comes to understanding that if he wants to be good enough for Lena, he has to destroy his old body. The clone in itself isn't malevolent - its just its nature. While we as humans may see the changes the entity is making as bad, its essentially merging all microscopic cells that it encounters. Its why we can hear Shephard's voice in the Skelebear, and why we see different species of flowers merging on the same plant structure. The nature of it being able to merge with other cells and organisms is very important and leads us to...

Lena proceeding to go into the tunnel where she finds Ventress. At that point, her and the singular entity have already merged. I honestly can't remember the exact dialogue but she says something along the lines of:

""We talked. Remember how I told you I wanted to find what's inside the lighthouse? I found it. Its inside me. Inside all of us. We will all be just fragments until we are one... ANNIHILATION"" - again not exactly but its what I can remember.

Lena then has the psychedelic vision, her blood gets enveloped in the entity, and it creates a ""blank canvas""/clone of her anatomical structure. She tries to shoot it, but its impervious to her bullets. It mirrors her, she tries to hit it and it hits back. She tries to run from it, but it prevents her. The clone sees itself and Lena very much as a part of each other, and doesn't want her to run away from it. She needs to go through the destruction of her self if she wants to move on from the guilt of her marriage and become anew (this seems like the primary motivation for Lena to enter the shimmer). 

The clone that formed from the entity views everything as part of itself. It wants to adapt and become better - but to become better you have to destroy your old self. When Lena touches its hand, it begins taking her appearance. She then puts the grenade in its hand. The clone is unaware of what this grenade is. That's why Lena pulls the pin, waits, and and is able to run out at the last second. The clone wasn't harmed by it - but the clone is still the entity. The nature of the entity is to mutate and evolve to its surroundings. Lena has left the lighthouse and the clone has returned to its metallic form. It is set afire in a blue plasma, and is looking for a form of life. It touches Kane's dead body - his body contains the physical form of ash. The clone then touches the vines that are in the lighthouse and they are cast afire. By touching Kane's ash body, the clone absorbed the physical reaction of something being burned to ash. It is set ablaze and dies in ash, and we see the glass trees surrounding the lighthouse light up and disintegrate into ash. Benedict Wong's character then clarifies in the interview room that a team has reached the lighthouse and it is all ash.

What I take from this, is that all life on Earth has derived from a singular organism. Maybe not the one that landed in the movie, but something similar that landed on Earth long ago. It begs the question - was the meteorite sent by some higher cosmic entity? Or is the entity itself just a higher life form/the original life form?

Now I can read the hug at the end between Kane and Lena two different ways.

1. Her hug was more just that she understands the clone is not malevolent. We are all apart of it and it is just trying to be itself.

2. Lena realizes that they are the only people to have entered the shimmer and return. They are both different on a cellular level. They are the evolved version of humanity. Does she realize they should still be together to reproduce and pass on these cellular mutations to another generation? Will them reproducing create a new life form on Earth? The film with this interpretation delves more into the importance of a man and woman in a relationship and that both are needed to reproduce (Like BR2049). 

These definitely aren't the only interpretations from the ending but I love the discourse about it from everyone.

She's a princess but she's also the heir to the throne and is being taught to be a great leader to he people. It's part of her hero's journey. No focus on a love interest at all. That final ""villain"" moment was beautifully executed and unexpected. Not only was it stunning to look at, but the movement in the music and the revelation of who the monster was is one of the strongest moments in any Disney film ever. I was scared she would talk for a moment but I'm so so glad they didn't go that route. 

The music. Just wow. When your weakest song is a Flight of the Concords track, then you know it's excellent. It's on par with Beauty and the Beast. So many moments had me either tearing up or laughing hard (You're Welcome especially).  Lin Manuel-Miranda is the next Menken  if he keeps this up.

There are definitely things to nitpick like how contrived the coincidences are or the forced climax, but it’s easy to overlook them because you do get sucked into the story, also, the last 10 minutes absolutely destroyed me.

The movie reminded me of Up. There’s a recurring message about loss of family/loved ones. It follows a kid and an old man which have a family like bond. There’s a slow witted but loveable dog sidekick that provides comedic relief. There’s a famous old guy that one of the main character’s idolizes. In the half way point they meet the old guy and he seems super nice and cool, but then it turns out he’s the villain and tries to murder them.

It's like I had to sit there and be reminded that Amy Adams hated her life over and over in order for the novel to continually be advanced. The novel was captivating and very tense, but any time it switched back to the past or current Amy, I was just bored. The dialogue wasn't interesting at all to me. I don't have a problem with the story or how things ended, but man, I just really didn't care at all about Amy's character. I actually like how the movie ended and how she didn't get to erase her mistake just because she realized she was unhappy (again) and shouldn't have left Jake's character. 

This film felt super empty and not, like, symbolically empty. I understand what her struggle was and the problems she had with her world. I just don't think the symbolism lines up with the novel and her story, like people seem to be implying.

I also keep thinking of the scene when Gheorghe walks off toward the edge of the hill and Johnny wonders where he's going - and then when he gets there the two look over the absolutely gorgeous landscape before them. And you just see that look on Johnny's face - the first time he seems to really appreciate and take in the beauty of his surroundings - and Gheorghe just looks and smiles at him knowingly.

 Something I specially loved and appreciated is the fact that she's not just ""a leading female role"" to make people contempt about the current Hollywood situation, but she's a whole character herself, a whole person, with flaws, motivations and a million angles.

28699,"Just saw this today and I’m torn. While it looked gorgeous and featured some truly phenomenal performances, I think Greta Gerwig made a few artistic choices that prevented this adaptation from reaching its full potential.


1) The first act felt very disjointed. This might’ve been because it took me awhile to adjust to the nonlinear narrative, but I also felt that scenes within the same timeline transitioned from one to another jarringly and without any sense of flow. 


2) Bob Odenkirk and (to a lesser degree) Laura Dern felt miscast, which took me out of the movie.


3) Gerwig should’ve chosen older actresses to play Florence Pugh’s classmates in the schoolhouse scene, because the obvious disparity between Pugh and the literal children surrounding her looked ridiculous.


4) Dern declaring that she hated her country came out of nowhere. In fact, I feel like that whole scene could’ve been cut out.


5) Meryl Streep’s character felt underdeveloped.


6) I just don’t buy Timothee Chalamet being as old as his character seemed to be by the end of the film.


7) Beth’s death scene was powerful, but I don’t understand how Beth could’ve died and been taken from her room without Ronan waking up at her bedside.


All things considered, I deeply enjoyed this film, I wish I enjoyed it more than I did, if that makes any sense.",1

13270,"As somebody from Northern Ireland it was sort of bizzare, you had these really poignant scenes, particular with the grandad followed by cheesy scenes about how dumb it is that people are at each others throats. Half the shit regarding the politics side of things was just so unbelievable it pulled me out of the movie. A couple of them were.

The fact that he went to school with a Catholic girl would just never have happened. Even today, nearly all children who go to schools here are segregated, the idea of this happening in the 1960s was so bizzare.

The B-specials (who were the militarised police in Northern Ireland) intervening in the middle of a loyalist pogrom was hilarious. The reason why the army were sent to Northern Ireland in the first place was because they were refusing to go in and protect areas from these groups, often because many people in these groups were  members of the police.

The scene when they are describing themselves as Irish and talking about their history of going abroad was also bizzare. If they were Protestants in Belfast in the 60s it would be unlikely they would describe themselves as Irish and would class themselves as either British or Northern Irish. 

I think the politics side of thing is just more of a hook to get people into the movie and to make it seem like it is saying something deep or important. 

At this point I'm kind of used to it though. In media the troubles has never been portrayed particularly well, off the top of my head I can only think '71 and maybe some of the scenes in Derry Girls.",1

I know, I probably shouldn't be criticizing the writing for a certain character when I'm not one hundred percent sure *why* I don't like it but hasn't her character arc been done to death? 

I can't think of examples right now but the whole ""main character starts acting cool and distances herself from uncool friend"" is something I'm sure I've seen many times in movies and series. And there's nothing wrong with her character being based on an archetype and providing the conflict for the second act, but it's kind of a missed opportunity to not give her character more depth. During the second act, Danny struggles with his sexuality, Larry just got laid off, Marion has her usual disagreements with Lady Bird and...Julie is mad at Lady Bird because she's acting cool?

So essentially they were just going off the idea that Cecilia sent her sister an email saying she wanted to kill her, and she was holding a knife at the restaurant after her sister's throat was slit, and so she must be the murderer.

13912,"I loved this movie! I was interested in the Enoch baby in a jar being some kind of allusion to The Book of Enoch and/or Enoch in the Bible. Book of Enoch is an ancient Hebrew religious text not included in the Bible. From what I understand one of the main gists of the Book of Enoch is that Enoch sees everything and conveys a message that if God is willing and able to tear apart an angel, man should be terrified of God and never doubt his absolute power. It also warns that God will execute his judgement on all the evil and ungodly ones. We can see this play out throughout Nightmare Alley. Enoch has that third eye, signifying he is a watcher of sorts—he sees all. Also: Didn't he tear apart his mother at birth? And isn't he himself (baby in the jar version) sewn up as if he was torn in part as well? Interesting parallels... Judgement was definitely executed on Bardley Cooper's character for meddling in the dark arts and lying to and defrauding people. So there's that as well. Would love to hear others' thoughts on this! I'm no biblical or Hebrew scholar so please if you have more knowledge about this weigh in :)",1

I was looking at an old one from before the movie came out and I found a lot of nasty comments about how Saroo was stupid because he didn't know his way home. We are all commenting on computers and technology that comes so easily to us that some people don't even realize their privilege. He knew how to get to his home by himself from places near by, but he ended up extremely far away. He mispronounced the name of a small village that might not have been on any map. The movie ended saying that 80,000 children are lost in a year, there aren't the resources to try everything to reunite each child. They put his picture in the news paper, but his family couldn't afford a news paper and a news paper may not have even reach their village. He was also uneducated and when moved in with his adoptive family, it was the first time he ever saw a map. Also, unlike in the countries most of us are from, I read that he feared going to the police, because they didn't help beggars and would just bring him to an orphanage. A lot of people on the street were unwilling to help and they ignored him. I was also heartbroken to see people call her a bad mother. Yes, in our privilege countries, parents would get in trouble for letting their child do all the things that he did and she would be considered a bad mother, but we don't understand that poverty: to not be able to feed your family, to work for hours and get maybe a rupee, to beg for scraps just to get by while still being hungry.

The physicist, reflecting on what just happened, talks about how ""it must be horrible to die scared and in pain and only having your screams of fear live on as the only remnant of you"" or something to that effect referring to how the voice of the woman who got dragged off by the bear still lived on in that bear. 

Later on, we see a scene where Lena is reading ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" next to Kane in a flashback. The book details the story of Henrietta Lacks, a woman who died from cancer in the middle 20th century but who had her cervical cancer cells taken during her treatment by a physician (without Lacks' consent or knowledge) for research purposes. Those cancer cells from Lacks live on today as the HeLa immortal cell line and have been used (and continue to be used) extensively as a study model for many important biological innovations (e.g. Salk tested his polio vaccine on these cells).

It seems like Garland is pointing to Lacks as a real life example of what happened to the woman who got killed by the bear; it would be terrible for you and your family to know that the only part of you physically living on is the mutated cancer cells that ultimately killed you. No matter how much good has and will be done with these cells, these cells that were once you and that ultimately unmade you will be the only vestiges that define your legacy.",0

It's tough for movies get get strong emotional responses out of me, but this one sure did. Maybe it's because the story lands too close to home for me. While I'm not gay or black, this is the closest I've been to seeing my life put on screen in front of me. So many aspects of Chiron's life parallel mine, down to he drug-ridden neighborhood, derelict mother, vicious bullying, and breaking bad. The scene where the woman tells him if he were a man there would be four other knuckleheads there with him put me as near to tears as I've been in a decade. I heard some version of that comment so. many. times. It breaks you because it's justifying others being a piece of shit because you are not one yourself. If only you would be less than who you are, the wold would accept you--soul crushing. I'm a bit tied up in this movie, so I'm probably biased. That ceded, It's the movie of the year IMO and possibly the decade. 

I love how it's shot. There is a visually interesting cyclical pan they use a couple of times that seems like a take on the linear pan used in films like Birdman and  Revenant. It's less gimmicky and helps to focus the environment on the people in it.

There is this great mix of earthy grit mixed in with beautiful shots like the neon room scene. That was especially powerful given the darkness of the moment.

Casting/Acting is great. The three actors that portray Chiron all draw you in with their broken humanity. Trvante Rhodes is able to overlay brokenness with a sort of ''fuck it"" hardness. 

Any flaws are nitpicks, but here they are.

Janelle Monae. Everyone else is hyper realistic and low key except for her looking like a Hollywood dime. She stuck out a bit.

Juan's death felt like a huge missed opportunity. He dies between chapters and they only mention it once, indirectly. There was a lot of emotional investment there that was lost, but the film glosses over it. 

I had a bit of an issue with Juan's role in the film too. This is the story the film chose to tell me, and it's not impossible or anything, so I'll take it at face value, but I've never met any benevolent drug kingpins. My mind was in a dark place when he started to mentor Chiron. I've seen hustlers take kids under their wing, and it's always to get them into the game. I suppose that is inadvertently what happened, but his motivations were a bit idealistically pure.

24958,"I found this movie to be incredibly sad and heartbreaking. It’s basically an old man both reflecting on his life but also bombarding his own thoughts with a made up fantasy. Jake is a sad, lonely janitor with nothing going for him and no one in his life. Everything happening in the movie is just him creating this fantasy life with a woman to help cope with himself. She’s the only thing keeping him alive, and her reflections on their relationship is basically his own self-reflections on his life. Shes starting to not see any reason to stay with him, and that’s basically just Jake not seeing any reason to continue living. The scene close to the end with the girl speaking to the janitor about how she didn’t remember the guy from the bar and how he was basically just a mosquito was Jake throwing out his last shred of self-worth. When she hugged him and left, he was recognizing her for what she was, a fantasy. The only thing that was left was to end things (his own life).


The saddest scene in my opinion was the janitor sitting there alone watching that lame romantic film, because it’s basically just fuel for his continued fantasies, hence the actress in the fake movie briefly replacing Jessie’s character in one scene. To anyone who’s been in a real relationship, that film clip came off as corny and dumb, but to Jake it’s something he admired and craved (hence the actresses appearance in his own fantasy). I kind of compare that to how certain people interpret “500 Days of Summer” *very* differently.

14583,"I liked this movie a lot more than Into The Wild, which did leave me with a bad aftertaste. I never understood why he had to leave and what kept him out there searching. He was privileged and considered himself better than everyone and at the end it just made him, to me at least,  a pompous jerk (and I read the book, was hoping the movie would change my mind after hearing rave reviews, but no). On the other hand, Nomadland paints a much more understandable relatable narrative from all the characters who have a hole that is filled my constantly moving. 

I think I understand that her moving is not because she is ""better"" or ""discovered the truth about evil society"" like Into The Wild, but instead she (and all the others) move so that their grief can't consume them and that movement, no roots, becomes like breathing,  it is just normal and has to be done.  There is no pretension nor trying to convince anyone that traveling/tramping/vanlife is something everyone should do (and looking down on those who don't do it - Fran even trys to tell the young guy with the lighter to go back home) it's just what works for them and keeps them going.  There is no search for a solution (like the Secret Life of Walter Mitty - another movie I detest), meaning that piece that will fix everything, it's just surviving with yourself. I completely understand her reluctance to become a lodger in someone else's life, especially that late in her life. 

I think the sunsets are important to showcase that there are different perspectives to life and that one choice isn't necessarily better or worse. Did you go look at the pretty sunset today or were you watching tv or working or driving home or...? For these people the sunset matters,  for others maybe not so much.  In the end, they do their thing and deal with their issues themselves,  so they can continue to be self contained.  Maybe I'm just older now and relate to the Nomads but I definitely felt like I understood them a lot better than Chris McCandless/Alexander Supertramp.",1

55762,"Wondering why I'm not seeing more about one of the most important themes in the film - the fact that the suspect/soldier/rapist is ironic and symbolic. 

Essentially, he is a rapist and murderer. He raped and murdered a girl in Iraq or Afghanistan. He lives amongst us with impunity and gets away with it bc of the blind eye we turn to such things for people who mean little to us here, and who are marginalized. That man, the way he rubbed her daughter's death in her face, was indicative of the kind of scum that he was, and the brazen way such people walk amongst us. 

The fact that the characters in this film were able to evolve and change, not always through direct salvation or attainment of their actual goal (we never find Angie's killer, the dwarf never gets to fall in love, Dixon doesn't become a detective), but find it in other ways (The chief leaves earth on his own terms, Angie's mom for once wishes her ex well rather than giving him the angry reaction he wants, Dixon finds a true suspect through different means), and this keeps up with said theme. We never find Angie's killer. But there is a chance at identifying and possibly bringing to ""justice"" another rapist/murderer of young girls. 

To me, this all sums up the fact that despite life's chaotic, and often unfulfilling circumstances, we can find salvation and the universal attainment of progress in indirect, human ways amidst the random unrest. 

Anyway, so much more to discuss and so many great themes everyone is touching on...but just wanted to bring forth that particular aspect of the film, where I feel something important was being alluded to, much like police brutality issues, racism, and other things in the film. .",1

I really don't mind Wes Anderson movies.  Bottle Rocket is a near perfect film, and the Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the best movies I've seen in the past 20 years, but this movie is pointless, emotionless wanking by a director who has such a locked-in style that, for whatever reason, he seems less and less comfortable straying away from.   He's just going to continually get away with this stuff because he's loved and people love his movies.

Bill Murray's character could have been the most interesting of them all but his presence and brief and his >!death!< is a mere footnote that they spent a bit of time in beginning building up to.   Isn't he the central character in all of this?  I wish he was.

I also felt like the kid and the adult carried themselves in this calm quiet kind of ""what can I possibly do with this life?"" attitude. Teenage Chiron I didn't feel that way.

The top comment here paints it like its *meant* to be disgusted at, and maybe it is, but that was NOT the impression I got at all, and the ending cemented that for me. I really feel like this movie was trying to invest me in these character's romantic journey but you cannot shake how completely vile it is throughout the whole film.

59762,"I thoroughly enjoyed this, but I will caveat it's mainly due to sentimental reasons. Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney Renaissance era movie. It was to me what little girls experienced for Frozen.

I think Emma did a fine job acting, although her singing was mediocre to fine at best. It was not as moving like the original. Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor (who I did not even know was in the movie!) did superb singing numbers... as did the guy that played Gaston. He played a very believable conceited prick. I do wish he had more sleeveless scenes to demonstrate his muscles... would have been more comical.

Beast was not a scary looking persona. They seemed to have put more human features in him then the original. His nose looked like a human's nose. His horns pointed back, which made him look less menacing.

The CGI was impressive, especially with the intricate moving parts in Cogsworth, the bronze folds of Lumière and the draperies in the dresser lady. Parts of it felt a lot like a Disney ride, especially in the ""Be Our Guest"" sequence. 

Nice addition to Beast and Belle's backstories. It kind of fills in the perpetual ""where is [character's] dad/mom?"" question you ask in the Disney animations.

Really great family film overall... probably a good date movie if your partner can take the Disney cheese and magic.",0

However one of the bigger plot lines that i was reflecting back on was the lack of use or perception of use for the Green Book itself. i mean it's the name of the movie, i would've thought that the book itself would have a little more of main storyline. in reality if Tony had never been given the book the movie would have carried on exactly the same minus the one scene where he used it to find them a hotel. one would assume that they might've leaned a little bit more on the knowledge housed in the book and the necessity for such a book like that to be published in the first place.

I'm saying the antagonists aren't the villains because the ""heroes"" shouldn't have shot those people in the opening act in the first place, bad intelligence or not. They didn't get an accurate count of people in the house, didn't restrain any of the ""spies""/""terrorists"" they detained so that those supposed ""spies""/""terrorists"" couldn't use their hands, didn't check for any weapons, allowed that shit to go pear-shaped and figured the solution was to shoot every single person there. The ""heroes"" were hilariously incompetent.

2178,"Sadly, I don’t resonate very much after watching the film.
I like Emilia Jones very much. I adore her performance in Patrick, and she portrays such a lovely, strong character as Ruby in CODA. Yet in a semi-musical film, her singing performance was just not as mesmerizing as I expected. Literally when I watched her sing each time in the film, I wished the scenes would be more powerful. I know she trained hard for the role, maybe I’m too picky, but I genuinely think a singer-actor would be a better fit to the role in terms of the musical tension. For example, the Irish indie film Once starred by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova was an astonishingly beautiful musical film.

Emilia’s singing also diminishes the gravity of the climax scene of the audition when she sang Both Sides Now. It is such a beautiful song that I’ve always loved, yet her voiced doesn’t have a shocking power that strikes me to the bones. Again, the power I felt when I watched Once, the rock musics and choruses took place in the climax when the outstanding singers/protagonists expressed emotions and feelings through facial expressions and voices. In CODA I didn’t have that transcending feeling. 

Criticisms aside, maybe the texture of CODA is more realistic than dramatic. It is illustrated in portraying the deaf communities and worlds, maybe also in Ruby’s singing. After all she’s just a teenager girl, I shouldn’t get my hopes too high. Yet I kind of have my feeling stuck in the middle and not expressed fully when the movie ended. I don’t resonate very much with the rest of the audiences who cried buckets, not that I don’t have a heart or I lack taste, I have a father whose hearing was impaired all his life after an AOM attack, I had trouble communicating with him and my other families for my entire life and I fully understand the bitter taste when you hardly can share thoughts, hardships with families and have to stick it out all on your own. It’s just the film is not as realistic as it is when it comes to the difficulties faced by the family and Ruby’s life. Ruby got into Berkeley and her family’s business is prospering. Yes the road to the end was difficult, but the hardships were delineated less realistic than the real life situations when you know it can get REALLY REALLY hard, and harder in the situation of deaf communities. The texture of the film feels like a Disney movie, but not as dramatic and romantic as a Disney movie.

But again, maybe this is the picky critic in me that’s been roasting. I’ve never scene another film that focuses on the disabilities with such genuine plots, character arcs and emotional base. It is a delight to watch CODA, and I’m going to rewatch it many times to appreciate the performance of Emilia, Troy and other lovely actors.",1

It’s the handsomest and the most action-packed adaptation, but I felt that the added drama [such as Poirot chasing McQueen or Abuthnott nearly murdering Poirot](#spoiler) wasn’t really necessary. Moving a lot of the action outside the train took away from the tension and claustrophobia of the previous versions. [The Count’s introduction of him beating up several reporters, (even roundhouse kicking one of them), was simply absurd.](#spoiler)

I also felt that some of the cast members, such as Judi Dench, Olivia Colman and Penelope Cruz were underused, considering their formidable acting abilities. On the other hand, Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley were standouts in the film.

Branagh himself was a serviceable Poirot, and I liked his introduction. But he didn’t quite hit the mark the way Suchet and Finney have. It didn’t help that his moustache was simply too exaggerated.

Did anyone notice the amount of long takes in this? The opening monologue is one cut, the majority of the dinner scene, the cut of her rolling up to the party, the cut of her walking into the backyard and getting into the pool, and the cut of her running into the house and up the stairs after the car scene. The way the camera just sits there stagnant at times, like in the mall the cuts just hang there. The way the actors were able to keep the uncomfortable pacing, and to see Kayla mouthing what she wanted to say but was afraid to speak up or even know how to inject herself into a conversation really stuck with me.

There's very little shot/reverse shot, and the times I noticed it were important. The campfire scene is one of them, we see then problem from both Kayla and her dad's perspective. She's finally being honest with her dad and herself and we the audience get to see it from both perspectives. 

The entire scene in the car is multiple cuts, but the camera location doesn't move. It's always from Kayla's point of view. Riley says something and the camera is from behind the driver's seat. Then it cuts to a close up of Kayla's face and the camera is still from behind the driver's seat. Bo's trapped us in the car with this situation happening to us, we never view this scene from the other side of the car, and the audience can only look on and hope Kayla makes it.

The script and acting were top notch, but I think a nod to Andrew Wehde's cinematography with Bo's directing is very well deserved.",0

15019,"I might be mistaken, but after recently watching the film I thought there was a period in between Anne’s husband (possibly) hitting Antony and Anne’s move to Paris.

So, when I was watching it, I thought it was:
- Antony lives in his own flat. The Angela fallout occurs and he lives with James/Paul and Anne.

- During this time, they find a new caretaker named Laura. This goes on for a few years but there is another fallout. James/Paul get fed up with Antony (possibly hitting him as a result).

- Then, Anne and James/Paul get a divorce. (This is where I’m most confused.) I thought there was a period where Antony and Anne are living together in Anne’s own flat (away from the now divorced husband). She again is trying to take care of Antony. She takes care of him for a while — going to get groceries, taking him to the doctors, etc. But, somewhere, she starts to realize his mental state is decaying rapidly. Parallel to this moment, Anne has met someone named Paul in Paris. She decides that she must take him to a nursing home and start living in a more detached manner from Antony (although she seems him every weekend).

- And, lastly, Antony is by himself in the nursing home. This is where I suspect (like most others do) the entire film takes place.

One of the things that I realise after watching the movie, is the score: I normally never care about, unless is distracting, but in this case, I found it super fitting. The acting is top notch and the directibg and cinematography are superb.

The only problem I got is with the script: did it really needed to be 3h long? Sure, it moves rather efficiently and even when ""nothing"" happens... I couldn't help but wonder: could that first act, the whole set up of him walking on his wife having sex with the actor, him having that car accident and the subsequent death and ceremony of his wife...

This movie was meh.

Competent but on autopilot. Hanks and Streep were OK but not at their greatest, a lot of the supporting cast were wasted and the script was alarmingly unsubtle and shouldn't have been nominated for a Globe. The themes were pretty much spelled out on the most annoyingly on the nose way possible (like Sarah Paulson's shoehorned speech and that eye rolling court walk scene).

Oh and that ending was just ridiculously goofy and dragged out what could have been a nice ending.

It's not all bad - the score's great and some scenes of the journalism and printing were genuinely quite enthralling.

61682,"Personally I thought this was one of the worst movies of the year and Branagh completely butchered the story with his disregard for the genre. My biggest gripe is that it is poorly paced and doesn't do any of the detective work that is to be expected of a story like this. As many people have noted, the film wastes too much time focusing on irrelevant points and shoehorns too many things (like an ill-conceived racial commentary and a random chase scene in the snow lol). It completely forgets that you have let the audience in so that any tension is build up with the audience trying to solve it as well or else its just a bare crime thriller. Characters are poorly introduced and developed, where some of them are just mindlessly neglected and only appear whenever they are needed. For example, the film is so lazy that it causally puts a montage scene for some of the characters despite the fact the audience should feel everyone is a suspect, but the film spends too much time on Daisy Ridley and Josh Gadd. 

The film really falls apart by the final third where it feels like Branagh is just rushing it with rapid-fire interrogation scene and the mystery is never let to simmer. Perhaps one of the most egregious part is where [Michelle Piffer's character gets stabbed (a change in the book) but the film never addresses this again and immediately cuts to the next scene despite being of vital importance. Similarly, where the doctor later shoots Poirot, the next scene is immediately the denouement without any consequences for the doctor](#spoiler). This has to be by far the worst denouement put on screen where there little flow and reasoning to how Poirot in this film got to his conclusions. Instead, it puts this bizzare moral thesis that is hard to believe given that the 'smartest detective in the world' surely isn't dumb enough to see the world as black and white... 

I immediately went to see the 1974 Lumet's version and fell in love with that. That is how it should be properly done with the mystery being the forefront and every character given the appropriate screen time. The 1974 manages to put the Armstrong side story at the forefront making it make a lot more sense in the context of the film which the 2017 version completely butchers. I love this genre of films and seriously hope more would be made (including a revised Sherlock Holmes), but this adaptation doesn't give me much hope unfortunately. ",0

But if they were able to breath in air as well as water (at least the royal members), then why can't a tribe or secret community of their descendents still exist in Sahara or elsewhere on the planet? To make sure they stay in touch with their roots, there could be certain ceremonies each members has to go through. For instance; once you reach adulthood, you are trapped in a container of water. When they are no longer able to hold their breath and starts breathing water, those who appears to be drowning are dragged out and saved. These will never be introduced to their people's secrets. Those who are able to breath water will be accepted into their society and be allowed to take a wife or husband with the same abilities.

Instead, the Terror-Dog just randomly spots him (where were all the other customers in the Wal-Mart?) and goes after him. 

And then you get the ghost cloud somehow tracking Callie down in Egon's lab... why? We know it tracked Egon back to the farm because he had something it wanted (Clortho spirit? Other Terror-Dog?), but how did it know to track Callie?

It’s wonderful that a strange art horror film can share a multiplex with franchise films and blockbusters. It’s clear that this was a passion project for Guadagnino, but to be honest I only liked it, I don’t love it. I prefer Call Me By Your Name. Here are my main gripes:

1.	The length. Jesus Christ. If this film was 90 minutes of everything involving the academy and the coven I would have loved it, but everything with the doctor just *dragged*. I know there’s metaphors and meaning to his story but I was too bored to care.
2.	The artistic choices at points were bizarre. Why change the frame rate at random points, especially during the climax? Also as much as I love Tom Yorke his original songs were played at the wrong time (not his score, but the stuff with lyrics). It’s strange because Sufjan’s CMBYN songs were perfectly timed, but here it felt like a blockbuster where they play a pop song for no reason.

Anyway, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different at the box office or just a fan of horror in general. I wish I loved it more :(

And there’s no payoff whatsoever. No consequences, or even a reaction to the incident. It might as well have been cut completely from the movie, as it has no bearing on the finale. 

The final scene in the movie literally features Jocasta acting like her normal bratty self towards Eloise, it’s like she wasn’t almost stabbed in the face. There’s no way in hell she’d be in the same room as her after that.

Some performances of the Natives seem a little too on-the-nose in describing the issues they face. While others (notably the older men) have better dialogue and act logically within the narrative.

I really the tribal police captain, because he had a bit of a small story arc with how I perceived him. At the beginning, I thought he was a ""hump"" that was going to be an obstacle for the main characters trying to solve the murder. I thought he doesn't want to mess with the status quo, and he doesn't care.

But then my perception of him starts changing, because you see that he is quietly jaded. He's understaffed, and overmatched, and he's seen too much failure in his line of work throughout all of these years, and he's just become numb to it even though he still cares inside.

He immediately sees the young FBI detective and thinks that he's knows this is going to end the same way as all the other times. He tries to stop Elizabeth Olsen from pushing the locals too hard, not because he doesn't like the outsider pushing, but he knows that she doesn't understand just how rough a condition the locals are in.

They make some progress, and he's still apprehensive about the effort. And then you begin to see him have hope that they could get a decent lead towards solving this case.

And by the end, he's a believer in the two partners he's got, and he went out of his way to get a couple more State Troopers because he thinks that they are close to nailing it. He ends up being fully awake and being a cop with fight in him near the end. I really liked that guy's performance.",0

The main takeaway is a powerful message: The impact of Racism continues to be damaging in our society and must not be taken lightly. Judging by the surprise reaction to the charlottesville events, maybe we, as a society, need to get the message forced to us continually. Sadly, though, the ones that need to see this message are not the ones who will be watching the movie. And, ultimately, I think that’s why I would have preferred a more subtle comparison of past and present. Subtlety is rarely allowed in a Spike Lee Joint, however...

Aside from Lee’s depiction of the evolution of racism over the 70 years, I did enjoy the movie. There were great performances from all, led by revelatory performances by Washington and Harrier.  My two favorite scenes were the “imitation of Ron’s voice” scene in the interrogation room and the scene where Ron sees just what the KKK members were shooting at. 

There were some narrative quibbles I found confusing, though, such as the introduction of ‘Flip’. He was just “there” without a backstory for why he was there. Also, his name is never revealed until the end, I guess, for dramatic purposes. Since the Jewish background was created for the movie, it seemed unnecessary to withhold that information until the end.

All in all, though, I feel like it was still in my top 10 of the year (currently #6). Powerful message, great soundtrack, great performances.

The ending is just brutally real! People want to debate whether it's happy or sad but in my opinion this was a love story just gone wrong.

The ending was tragic and just not just because they didn't fall in love but the fact that they both looked miserable. The last look was just an indicator that ""well this sucks but it's how it's going to be"". I don't know I just didn't really like the ending. They should have made him be just a tad bit more of an asshole. 

A good change that would have made the ending make more since is when Sebastian takes Mia to do her final audition before making it big he should have gotten a call from his band for a prior arrangment and would not have been there when she nailed the role. This would have better transitioned into acceptance from the viewer that the couple not picking back up in there relationship was the right call.

He was an intensely private man who was never out of the closet, and if Tony's son Nick was to be believed, the incident at the Y was the only indication he ever heard mentioned by his father or Shirley about Shirley's sexuality.

That old man Nai Nai constantly draggeds, turns out, there's a care system there. I'm not in this culture and yet, I wondered how that developed and how beautiful it is at the same time. Knowing all this, you feel dread for him as well just like Nai Nai's sister.",0
52792,"Well, I've been sitting on this for about a month and having seen the movie twice now I can say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I was excited for this movie for a while, but still didn't expect to be completely floored by the entire thing.

This movie is a masterpiece and the best portrayal of firsts (sex, love, heartbreak) I have ever seen. Everything in the movie felt so real, it truly brings you back to your first love. It makes you feel the wave of emotions that you felt the first time you fell in love.

Timothee Chalamet gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance in this movie. I can't begin to express how talented he is. He completely encompasses Elio. Honestly the first time around I barely even took note of the other amazing performances here because my eyes were glued to Timothee the whole time. Armie Hammer is fantastic as well, I was able to relate to him and his role in the situation. He is very conflicted, sometimes warm, sometimes cold. And Michael Stuhlbarg is great as well, he has such a presence on screen.

The music in this movie is what I can only describe as beautiful, Sufjans songs in particular stand out as incredibly moving. Visions of Gideon is an absolute soul crusher. The music added to the atmosphere of the movie, which was so warm and peaceful. It was so refreshing to see a movie about two men in a relationship that didnt end with one of them dying or angry parents, nothing of the sort. Time is the villain here, and I think that makes it all the more tragic.

I will say while I love the movie, it didn't have the profound effect it did on me until the scene with Mr. Perlman near the end. I'm not someone who is easily affected by movies and shows but that monologue destroyed me. It's a universal message to anyone feeling pain and on a more personal note something I needed to hear. I had been pushing away and trying to just forget certain things in my life but after seeing this movie I felt a whirlwind of emotions that led me to finally being able to be happy about past relationships rather than bitter. I guess you could say this movie changed my life and how I view relationships going forward.

Overall, Call Me By Your Name is a deeply moving film about love with a fantastic performances, amazing atmosphere, and a few scenes that will stick with you (the monologue, Elio by the fire). I can't recommend it enough. ",1

Somethings to keep in mind...

* Japanese stories are often paced for [four Acts](https://www.katekrake.com/forwriters/kishotenketsu-the-four-act-narrative-or-the-plot-without-conflict/) instead of three.  

* The movie is based on the first four volumes of the manga and they like the film are a prologue. The central conflict doesn't even start until Volume six. Before that the story was about Alita's daily life and was very much a small town hero tale.


***

Even if they had gone by the book.

This part of the story was always going to be ""YA"", because it was about a young adult growing up.


All the ""deep"", ""dark"","" rich"", ""existential"", cyberpunk themes and serious adult drama.

Didn't start coming in, until volume six.

Before that Alita in American terms would be a YA, albeit a dark and very violent one.

***



If Jim Cameron had started at six volume with Alita as an [Agent of Zalem](#spoiler) roving the wastelands carrying out her duties, until she gets on [Nova's trail](#spoiler).


It probably would have better received by the masses. 


But that hypothetical film would have needed flash basks and exposition-dumps to explain how and where Alita came from, and how she got into her current situation.

By showing these huge spaces even bigger and more distorted, and seeing everything within the space, and seeing how small the people can be in that space, it just felt that it represented a lot of themes in the film.

It’s just that slight little difference. We didn’t want a dragon that came in to empower [human protagonist] Raya to hit people more; we wanted one that would inspire her to open up and trust.”

BUT, I think a key addition is, that our self-destructive nature hinders us from joining evolution rather than becoming a victim to it.  In a non-human, grand-scheme view, the ending is actually a happy one ... a higher form of human and/or life is emerging.  But our ideas of being human, and our inability to give in to that hard-coded truth, prevents us from accepting it.  The only two characters who seem to embrace this are Dr. Ventress (who becomes a new being) and Josie (fate unknown, but possibly becomes a human/plant hybrid of some sort).  Everyone else panics, shoots, runs, etc.  But we can't out-run our biological fate of dying out.  Lena presumably destroys The Shimmer, but it's essentially too late ... a male AND female human/Shimmer hybrid now exist on Earth, and will presumably replicate and usher in the next stage of life.",0

14500,"It's interesting you mention how the theme is about American struggle and being left behind because I argue it's the opposite.  It's briefly dwells on these themes, but quickly moves on to a meditation on post American nihilism. But the first movements are revisiting the origins of Americaland and the pioneer ethos.

The Great Financial Crisis, the backdrop to this film, devastated millions of American families, leaving a lost decade and millions left behind.  It's this backdrop, exposing the failures of corporations an institutions to take care of folks' basic needs that we find the protagonist.  It clearly shows how modern American capitalism is not working for so many.   Which is why the theme of nomads/pioneers underpins the entire film.  IT revisits the origin story of the Pioneers who settled Americaland and ushered in the modern social-economic system that continues to underserve millions. That idea is underlined by her monologue on the vast space between her former home and the mountains.  That expanse and pioneer migration to settle somewhere is her life now.  Importantly, it mirrors the migration of millions of American falling out of the middle class.

It looks at America through its breathtaking natural wonders as the New World again.  A new world to be settled with different non-corporate/American capitalist values.  An example is the frequent tension between private property where one can not park overnight and the vast expanse of the public lands of the Badlands, where you can quasi settle.

Lastly, it's a meditation on the values of stuff vs experiences.  Afterall, the protaganist literally abandons most of her stuff, but never lets go of her experiences with Bo.  So, I'll argue how she didn't resettle with her sister because it would be returning to a life of stuff.  The last point I want to make is that this movie does provide a line of escape out of American nihilism by showcasing ad hoc community formation and human first experiences around these decentralized communities.

Post Script.

If you replace Bo, as a proxy for the American dream, it will illuminate the subtext of the film.",1

My favorite scene had to be the diner scene. Violet's face after she spit the water out of her nose was actually the most impressive computer animation in the movie to me. The way Bob and Dash were trying to impress Tony had me rolling in my seat as well.

The biggest negative to me was how much the new supers were different than the golden age heroes in terms of design. It went from supers who could conceivably fit in with an alter ego to mostly mutants.

I knew about the age gap, but I figured they’d make it a major point of the story. Which they did. But it seems this is one of those movies you watch and it doesn’t turn out how you want it to (me wanting Alaina to make the right decision, but her ultimately continuing to make snap spur of the moment bad decisions)

Those Asian jokes weren’t ever acknowledged other than the fact you could tell they were uncomfortable on screen. 

I know people over glorify the 60s and 70s a lot, so I guess I appreciate them not shying away from men being total creeps, especially in Hollywood. 

The age gap is weird, and I do think it’s to further play into the continuous bad decisions Alaina makes throughout this movie. The ending does not make me root for them, I was left feeling disappointed. 

It’s not a bad movie, the acting is great and I’m a fan of movies that don’t always make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. But, this just felt off. I think I need to give it another watch to further my understanding of it.

37932,"After being pretty badly disappointed with other adaptations of comics/manga, and being a huge fan of this particular manga AND someone keenly aware that they're now older than the main targeted audience, I was really afraid I wouldn't like this, but I am so happy I saw it!! The action scenes were arm-thumpingly fun, reminiscent of the fun I had when I saw Mad Max Fury Road, and yes the dialogue was cheesy but it drew from pretty cheesy source material (I say that with love) and makes sense in that light. It of course did chop up and move/merge a bunch of storylines/characters around (since of course the costs to implement any character or scene in a budget concious film add up, one's gotta condense things, I get it), but I think it did this in a fairly efficient and thoughtful way. I think that fact that it stayed silly and 'cute' (and not necessarily by American executive-driven standards) helped it SO much, as trying to get too gritty would have forced a need for more current-world realism in the writing, and as such I wasn't seeking that like I usually do and it WORKED.



The casting was pretty spectacular (probably the character I found most annoying in that sense was Hugo who did look pretty Mickey Mouse club-y, but even then he kinda works if considering who he was portraying from the manga, i.e. a silly, showboating adolescent who sparks Alita's puppy love despite not being particularly deep or cool). The diverse characters really kept things interesting visually and even audibly (different accents in a suppposed thrown together messy melting pot (as the scrapyard was conceived to be) really go a long way) and the visual background worldbuilding was almost constant, and did an awesome job of 'show don't tell'.


I was afraid Alita would come off as too creepy looking or too ""cringy westernized anime"" but she looked better in movement than she did in preview pics, plus in context of the URM all being that way it serves pretty well to distinguish her from regular ""Earth"" people while paying cheeky homage to the anime style. She is intensely emotional/dramatic to the point where people who haven't read the manga might find her super unrealistic, I can see that, but she's staying true to her character as originally written. I LOVED Mahershala Ali as Vector and Christoph Waltz as Ido and the glimpse of Ed Norton made me laugh. I was afraid the addition of new characters would be weirdly superfluous considering how much material they already had to jam into a couple of hours, but they didn't take up a lot of time or distract from the main storyline and they fit in pretty well with the established aesthetic.



I was even afraid to lose 'Octopus lips', but her big-ass eyes kind of took the place of that :P",0

The story beat about Meg wanting that fabric to make a dress only highlights how she constantly put others ahead of herself. It also highlights how human she is and the dreams she is giving up everyday. Yet, Meg is rational enough to know the vanity of the former and the substantial sustenance of the latter. Both Meg and the role of Meg are thankless but required. Thankfully, Meg found a man who is willing to sacrifice and love as much as she does for the very same purpose, and actually adores and appreciates her too.

22102,"Pros:

* Millie Bobby Brown is really great in the lead role, especially for someone her age. A character who A) is that eccentric, and B) constantly makes asides to the audience could have easily become an annoying caricature, but she handled it well. 

* Henry Cavill's Sherlock is a refreshing change of pace from the sociopath we so often get. I'm sure by now everyone knows *why* we rarely see a softer side to Holmes, but I'm glad we got to see it here. If there's a sequel I hope he gets more screentime with MBB.

* Enola's journey was pretty well-handled. Like her brothers, she's a little larger than life, but her struggles and successes are balanced enough so that she never feels helpless nor invincible. 

Cons:

* They really glanced over the fact that Eudora was a domestic terrorist, huh? 

* I really hated this version of Mycroft. Where was his intellect? Why was he skinny? He wouldn't have bugged me so much if he was anyone other than Mycroft. 

Random Thoughts: 

* Reference is made to Sherlock being friendless, which implies to me  that he has yet to partner with Watson. And yet Sherlock seems to be something of a celebrity. But Sherlock was only ever famous because Watson writes about their adventures. Maybe there was a reference to Watson that I completely missed.

* This could be a touchy subject, but casting an actor of African and South Asian heritage as Lestrade is just weird. If this movie had been set in modern times like Sherlock or Elementary then I wouldn't have thought twice about it. But in the 19^th century? He just stands out. Say what you will about Kenneth Branagh's Murder on the Orient Express, but at least they addressed Leslie Odom Jr.'s casting in the movie itself.

* It seemed like a lot of the detection was mostly code breaking and puzzle solving. I would have liked more clues and logical reasoning. 

It's totally inoffensive. MBB does a great job as the lead, it's an easy and breezy watch and there's a scene where Burn Gorman tries to drown a teenager. I think families and little kids will enjoy it and, at the end of the day, that's who this movie is for.",0

30238,"I think this film will be a super controversial one but I think this is just how Quentin Tarantino is using his trope of rewritten history to give the movie a whole new level of meaning that’s never been done before.

 It seems like Margot Robbie’s character does nothing but I think she’s the most important part for that new, experimental dimension of the film. Going into it you know she’s supposed to die (at least in real life) so you watch waiting for clues that lead to her death but you really just see her living life because in real life, that’s how it went. There wasn’t clues. She was just living her life and then everything ends abruptly. She’s got a bunch of things going for her, and thinking about her as a human, it’s actually really nice to see a girl doing well in her industry and being able have all the things she ever wanted: Fame, fortune, being loved by the public.  And the idea that she might die the whole time makes it seem a little grim. But when she doesn’t die, and everything ends up going well for everyone, like how cliff got redemption for what he’s done, Rick dalton got his role with the hot young director, and Sharon Tate gets to live, there’s a sense of relief because it ends with a pleasant, happy ending— contrary to real life. 

The fact of it having a happy ending is kind of referenced in the title- once upon a time in Hollywood. This is like a fairytale opening. Not only does it foreshadow a happy ending but also has statement of how this doesn’t happen in real life. It’s a fairytale. I think a lot of people will not get it because for most movies, they exist in a vacuum. Everything in the movie usually is all you should  need to understand it but I think Tarantino tries to break that status quo by writing this story to be paired with the real historical events. The way that real life’s not so happy ending foils the movie’s happy ending adds a new level of depth that’s confusing because of how unexplored and and on the frontier of the art it is. When you look at Sharon Tate’s happy life in the movie and realize what actually happened, you start to feel sad for her and how her life could have gone. From the one dimensional view on everything that happened in the movie it is a seemingly confusing plot, but because of the way history effects the meaning of the events, there is a whole new level of depth that has barely if ever been explored intentionally in a well known piece of literature.

The idea that it was meant to be paired with the real story gives his rewriting history a purpose other than to be a part of the story. In this movie he isn’t just rewriting a history to make his universe different from real life, its to have a commentary and provide a new perspective on real life events that looks past the crazy, scandalous narrative. The way this foil calls attention to the fact that it’s just a story makes you realize that all these good things didn’t get to happen to real people and that what really did happen is much sadder. Everything actually came out for the worst. 

This may be a completely new device  that we’re watching unfold and it may have been what Tarantino intended to do with inglourious basterds but we were all too dazzled by the brilliant storytelling, cinematography, acting, editing, writing, and directing of to be able to see, but it makes me really want to rewatch both inglourious basterds and once upon a time in Hollywood so I can see through this lens again, this time while watching.

Which kind of makes me think some of the film's pacing could have been improved. With that said though, I can't say definitively that I truly believe either of these critiques to be true (Williams' performance being less than spectacular and the pacing being off). I need a second viewing to be able to finalize my opinions on both of these aspects. Overall, I give Manchester by the Sea an 8/10 and I think it's one of the best films of the year. Terrific screenplay, beautiful cinematography, top-notch acting. Worth a trip to the big screen to see it!

I still haven't figured out what to make of Matthew Broderick's role in the film. The whole theater all kind of laughed when he appeared on screen. Y'all think he was the right choice or no? What'd you think of how he was used in the movie?",1

- That scene where Bond was ascending the stairs shooting everyone on the island at the end was extremely well done, very intense and no cuts that I can remember?

- The ending was also very well done and quite emotional for me, I was crying sitting beside my dad lol

- I thought Rami Malek was pretty good but not given enough screen time and his motivations were a little hard to pin down 

- Overall definitely one of Craig’s best ones and I like that all five of his are kind of connected and make for a series of films that average out to be very good 

- I wonder how they will handle the next Bond. Will they have the same M, Q, and Moneypenny? How will they explain a new Bond?",0

Some people are just more sympathetic/empathetic by nature. I can see both the feeling that Ellie should be less empathetic towards Sandie after the murder attempt(s), and the feeling that Ellie just ""lived"" through Sandie's trauma(s), better enabling her to *deeply* understand how Sandie got so broken.

Life breaks a lot of us, some more than others. Sometimes life leads people down paths where they do terrible things. It didn't need to be that way, though, and it could just as easily have happened to you or I. Most people hope that we're doing the right things, and that if we're not, that people will understand and have empathy for us. Only seems right to try to have empathy and love for others, even when they do terrible things. (Which is not to say it excuses or absolves people for their actions, or that people shouldn't protect themselves.)",0

68024,"Primary colors! Primary colors and green are abound in this film. One thing I could say about Damian Chazelle's ""La La Land"" is that it is vivid. ""La La Land"" is about the relationship of two L.A. artists, Sebastian (Ryan Goslin) and Mia (Emma Stone), as they navigate through their careers. Chazelle tells this story through the use of musical scores, ""seasonal transitions"" (it's L.A.), and visual bliss. The audience sees how the characters feel. Sebastian and Mia's time at the observatory is an example of good visual storytelling. Both Ryan Goslin and Emma Stone are amazing in their roles. Their portrayal is very convincing and makes the audience care for their characters and their relationship. However, the music, which is a character itself in the film, really drives the film. Chazelle is no doubt a fan of Jazz, and he uses the genre to build and end Sebastian and Mia's relationship. The ending is very impactful. It highlights both Sebastian and Mia's desires to be with one another while acknowledging the price they paid for success. It is my belief that the title, ""La La Land,"" stems from the final scene. 

Overall, ""La La Land"" is a film that needs to be seen on either the biggest screen or 4K capable television set. It uses Jazz to tell a colorful story about two LA artists tied between their relationship and their careers. The ending is very effective, and the movie's cast is great. Again, I highly recommend this film be seen in theatres.

Another is that it adds to the film's theme of struggles and suffering in deeply internal spaces, having Tilda as the antagonist against herself in these different ways. In an interview, Guadagnino has mentioned you could view her three parts as Id, Ego, and Superego (you decide which is which). I don't think the film is worried about keeping a firm boundary between itself and the world external to it.

57909,"I feel like this movie is a bit of a mixed bag.  More specifically, it was like Chronicle and Transformers had a shameful love-baby that somehow managed to pick up most of the charm of the former without the various deformities of the latter.

Specifically, I felt that the writing in the beginning was pretty well done and really did a good job of characterizing the first three rangers we see.  Yellow and black, on the other hand, seemed to have been penciled in early in script-writing and then fleshed out as an afterthought (to the extent that I can't even remember their names at this point, as you can see in this sentence).  [I mean, we don't learn anything substantive about the life circumstances of two of these characters until at least halfway through the movie, and only then because they drop a fat chunk of expository dialogue around a campfire wherein they reveal the one special thing that defines them - sick grandma for one, some unspecified sexual identity stuff for the other.](#spoiler)  It's always kinda bothered me that the rangers have always been largely defined by maybe one or two character traits and little beyond that, which was why the whole intro sequence and the consequences of that in terms of character development were a welcome surprise.  Nevertheless, there's a critical mass of telling rather than showing invested into this movie [(wherein Billy, as if by magic, instantly understands the history between Zordon and Rita from staring at a neon fart cloud for five seconds)](#spoiler), and the only explanation I can think of is that the film would have run too long for young audiences if they wrote everything as thoroughly as they did with Jason's arc.  This aspect is worst around the halfway mark.

Under the cheesy monologues about friendship and teamwork, I did see a glimmer of hope in the action sequences.  This iteration of Rita really made the stakes seem real, and the reactions of the townsfolk to a sudden alien threat are a bit more plausible than they were in the show [to the extent that someone has the wherewithal to shoot at Rita when it's clear that she's dangerous, she murders some hobo for his gold teeth, and she frikken lashes the rangers to a boat and drowns Billy even after they capitulate to her demands.](#spoiler)  If this movie was a little less afraid of it's own edginess, it could have been something magical.

My rating for it was 6/10, with 5 being ""you made a movie"" on my scale.  It's ultimately harmless, but not groundbreaking.  You could do worse with your afternoon, but you probably won't remember it when DVD season rolls around unless you happen to see an add.",0

8174,"Unsurprisingly this movie seems to be very divisive, I think it works for some people and doesn't for others. Let me preface all this by saying that I'm not challenging anyone who enjoyed it, and more power to you if you did. But personally I don't understand the hype here.

Even completely ignoring the whole weird age gap thing, I just don't find it to be a strong cinematic experience. 

It's a well made film, it has good cinematography, and a good use of soundtrack. I would even say that PTA managed to have every actor squeeze as much life out of their characters as possible, there really isn't a weak performance in the whole movie.

However, the script felt all over the place for me. The plotline meanders to and fro without care and when it finally lands it feels like just a waste of 2 hours. Having the whole age gap dynamic is actually a great plot device to explore the themes of both teenage infatuation and the ""lost"" phase of someone's 20s at the same time. On paper I should love this movie idea, as I typically gravitate towards these types of films. But I really don't think he manages to juggle both themes simultaneously very well here. Other films have captured and explored both of these themes so much better separately, so I didn't derive much from what was presented. It doesn't help that the character Alana still *acts* like a teenager rather than a 25 year old, which kind of defeats the entire point imo. I felt that Gary *did* feel very much like a teenager, so when Alana reacts to their relationship adversity with all the angst of a high school sophomore, that contrast between their two perspectives completely fades away. There are some scenes where it shines, like her awareness of the oil crisis or when she attempts her plunge into politics, but those moments are so few and far in between that she never really felt distinguished from Gary as an adult. Watching Alana try to prove to herself that she was ""cooler"" than Gary wasn't some kind of charming inner struggle, it was hard to watch. A 25 year old who has to question whether or not they're cooler than a 15 year old is still in a teenage mindset to begin with. And if that was an intentional decision about her character it begs the question, why even have her be 25? Why not just make her 18 and him like 16-17? Not much in the movie would've had to change. 

As a result most of their interactions felt like adolescent puppy love rather than a morally questionable complex love between an adult and a teenager. It felt like he didn't want to explore the implications of such an age and maturity difference completely; but if you wanted to do something like that you should go all-in rather than just hesitantly dip your toes in the water. Their entire relationship felt fabricated and forced to me, and really only existed because Alana didn't want to let him go. Not once did I really find myself caring whether or not they'd end up together, in fact there was so much on-and-off toxicity between them that I found myself actually rooting for them to find other people. The running into each other sequence at the end where they callback to previous running scenes felt so forced and unearned. Most of the romantic and sexual scenes just ended up feeling like an opportunity to make an easy joke about how teenagers view love and sex, and nothing more. 

At the end of the day it's a fun romp with memorable performances and strong art direction, but I really don't think it had much to say. It wanted to be a period piece, coming-of-age, comedy, and romance film all at once, and I think as a result it doesn't excel at being any of them. And that's ignoring all the fantastical elements of the story where you're forced to suspend your disbelief, like a 15 year old running and managing two businesses with employees 10 years his senior. 

I get why people enjoyed it, it's a pleasant movie to watch, but the moment you begin to scrape beneath it's surface it unravels completely. Just my opinion.",1

I thought at the end he was just a normal guy lol. He comes in and says hello and then leaves. But I also guess since that the brain can't make new faces, Anthony used his.

I think its great for little girls(and boys) to finally have a powerful female superhero they can admire and look up to.
I also felt the humor was handled super well in this movie. It added a lot of humanity and charm to the film overall.


I dont think the movie is perfect by any means, and it definitely suffers a little in the 3rd act, but the main character, Gadot specially, and the very last moments between her and Pine make it all worth it IMO. In the end, it celebrated Wonder Woman and what she stands for, a true superhero.

74345,"**I'm going to explain batman's ""dreams""**

**spoilers ahead** (not just for BvS but probably for the next couple of justice league movies):

First and foremost not of the ""dreams"" were really dreams. I'm going to explain the ""dreams"" out of order because it's much easier to explain that way.


**The Desert batman:**
Before I can explain any of the dreams I have to explain Darkseid. [Darkseid](http://i.imgur.com/OHIXJfV.jpg) is basically space god Hitler/Mussolini, his entire goal is to subjugate everything in existence to his will. His method for this is something called the anti-life equation, a mathematical proof that proves that subjugation to Darkseid is the truth of the universe. When the desert batman looks out he sees a burning omega on the ground, this is Darkseid's symbol. What Batman is seeing is an alternate universe or future timeline where Darkseid has won. Superman is under Darkseid's control, this is why he is evil and after batman in this future. 


**The Flash:**
 After Bruce Wayne ""wakes up"" from this dream the flash appears to him in a worm hole to warn him about a future event. Unfortunately the flash went to far back in time and Bruce has no clue who he is or why he is there. While the flash does have limited time travel powers when he is using the cosmic treadmill, this isn't the case here. This appearance is a reference to [crisis on infinite earths](http://i.imgur.com/MIL28SO.jpg) where the [flash sacrifices himself](http://i.imgur.com/rqInMtx.jpg) to save the universe from the biggest dc baddies in the entire multiverse, the anti monitor.


**The Demon/Giant Bat:**
 Now you might be asking yourself, why is batman jumping through time or able to see the future? There is an explanation. Darkseid in reality is [not a physical being He's a living idea.](http://i.imgur.com/pNfSmQN.jpg) Batman must [betray his two cardinal rules in order to defeat Darkseid](http://i.imgur.com/GrSvEqR.jpg). Batman Shoots Darkseid with a radon bullet and kills him, however Darkseid is able to hit batman with his ultimate attack, [the omega sanction](http://i.imgur.com/WkIuTU2.jpg). The omega sanction is a prison of life, you relive your entire life, over and over and over. This is why batman has these pregonitive dreams, he's already dead and just remembering.


however it's not as simple as living over and over again. All this time there is something [stalking you](http://i.imgur.com/2Zo7BVE.png). This stalker is called the [hyper adapter](http://imgur.com/lLT3vo3) and is the giant bat/ demon creature that appears to batman in his parent's graves. In the end, Superman finishes off batman's work by [singing the idea](http://i.imgur.com/Of5xVi4.jpg) of darkseid out of existence.",0

Then again, if the movie is realistic people will complain about it not being imaginative enough. Too much sex, not enough. Actors miscast, actors not professional enough. Why can't we just sit down, watch the show and enjoy the ride?

The promotion of Red Sparrow might not have done it any favors. They did make it seem like the beginning of some female James Bond/Jason Bourne super spy movie. Though to their benefit they never really showed a lot of action in the trailers.

Also, outside Hollywood politics, PR, gossip and other things created a less than favorable audience environment.

However...

If we look at the film about a Fictional individual, working as a spy in a fictional world then maybe we can let all of our expectations and take it for what it is.  A  spy movie about a Mada Hari spy groomed by a Russian secret organization. There's nudity but nothing way out there and didn't help move the plot along. This can be said about the tape scenes as well. The movie doesn't really go anywhere that we haven't been before. But at the same time it does introduce us to some surprises. Some positive, some not and yes, some forecasted way before their moment to occur.

All in all an enjoyable movie. Not earth shaking. But better than agreeing to watch your sisters kids just to get access to their liquor cabinet and put stash.

In a *great* production, the performances make you believe the story anyways, beyond logic and reason. You buy into the love that keeps these two together. That through love, Maria somehow convinces Anita, for an hour, to help the man who *murdered her true love* escape with her (basically) little sister. It's so unbelievable, the fact that it can get you to suspend your disbelief for just a few minutes is what makes the tragedy come crashing down so hard.

The fact of the matter is a number of other pictures that did not have more than 50% English dialogue were considered by the Golden Globes for best picture and/or weren't limited to the category of foreign language film. This includes films that didn't take place in the U.S., weren't about the American experience, weren't produced or directed by Americans, and didn't have primarily American actors. So what's the difference then? Why was Minari precluded but those other films were not? My contention is that it's because Minari didn't feature enough white people, or perhaps it's because it featured too many Korean people.

19835,"Man, this movie was really good. Just super tight. Intense, scary, timely, psychological, really well shot and acted. I had heard it was quite good and I was still pretty surprised. 

Moss puts forward a hell of a performance. Considering half the movie is her reacting to negative space she is really carrying this thing on her shoulders and it looks pretty effortless.

 I appreciated how right off the bat in the first scene, her entire plan relies on being able to see him with her camera. We are instantly told how dangerous he is and the focus of the ability to see him without him doing anything. 

Really enjoyed the way of framing the story of the invisible Man as an abusive narcissist. Super frightening to imagine what such an intelligent abuser could do if they terrorize a single person. The ways he compartmentalized her from her family and friends, set her up to be framed. Absolutely frightening when he killed her sister, kind of a moment where you realize she's really helpless and totally fucked. 

I loved the camera work. It focused on the negative space in such a great way that the scenes were all suspenseful even if there was nothing on screen to make it so. Really impressive to craft so many scenes where the same thing is happening and make them each unique and scary. 

I was really happy with the ending. I know it kind of turns into a revenge thriller, but so much of the movie felt so helpless that I honestly thought she was gonna give him his final fuck you through suicide. Even after she was out of the hospital and he's still controlling the narrative. I liked how he never actually admitted it was him. It leaves a bit of doubt in the cop character but and forces him to ask himself is he believes her. 

And that's what this is all about. We see that she's telling the truth but imagine being in such a mental prison that no one would even believe you. That your abuser is walking free in daylight and no one will just give you the benefit of the doubt. The themes were so well portrayed I would almost consider this more of a drama than a horror. 

Easy 8/10. High quality stuff, would recommend.

I took this interpretation as the pain of these fantasies just like the pain of him wishing he pursued his art. He tapes it to stop reliving these fantasies where he realises its not real and becomes painful. Yet even when his tapes these fantasies off he still claws at the door to come back in as living these fantasy are some of the only happiness he gets.

The fantasies are his only happiness yet resolve in his big regrets when he comes back to reality and i think this is reflected in many scenes lile varnishing the floor to get high and live in these fantasies for longer, we even see himself pull away from himself (the girl at the ice cream store when he warns himself its dangerous)",0

I think it was that alcohol can loosen you up a bit but ultimately it's you that has to make the change within yourself. Alcohol made Nikolaj admit to himself he was unhappy with his family life (and exacerbate it) and he makes the choice to improve it. Peter admits he wants a partner and is dating someone by the end of the movie. Tommy perhaps doesn't see much of a life for himself and falls into alcoholism leading to his demise.

Alcohol makes Martin feel good but outside of one camping trip it doesn't make him a more present father/husband. Even when at his drunkest, he refuses to dance despite encouragement from his friends, he's not able to be his true self. It's not til the end when he's suffered loss, connected with his students and decided to try and rebuild his marriage that he's finally able to dance. Alcohol took him on a wild ride, and magnified the positive and negative aspects of himself/his life, but ultimately he had to make the choice to grow before he could feel like himself.",0

15780,"I like biopics, so of course I was going to see this. This is a movie of Hollywood legend. The central concept is the question: Why did Herman Mankiewicz and William Randolph Hearst fall out? Where did the vitriol in Citizen Kane come from? 

This film answers with, mainly, complete lies. They invent a close personal relationship between Mank and Marion Davies. They give Hearst a scene where he calls Mank a dancing monkey to his face. They make up a friend for Mank who hates Hearst and then kills himself. And least accurately of all, they portray Mank as having sympathies for Upton Sinclair's campaign. That *definitely* didn't happen. 

The most likely story, as far as I can tell, is that they were just two notorious assholes whose personalities clashed. Hearst was domineering and vindictive and Mank couldn't help himself from wryly insulting everyone he met. It makes a better movie to have it be a personal vendetta against a specific act, but real life often isn't that cinematic. 

Honestly, the stylistic elements don't add much.

23212,"You've well illustrated a lot of what I was feeling about this film. I've enjoyed others of Wes Anderson far more. By the time the animated car chase kicked off, I was past ready to be done. The development just wasn't there in the final one. I'm very curious how this film would work with the stories in a different order? 

Also about Chalamet...I've only seen him in Dune and this, so far. Neither showed me anything I cared much about. In Dune, it was a lot of face mugging for the camera, which doesn't impress me. I felt they really underdeveloped his, and many other, characters in that film, so maybe he didn't get a fair shake, but his was not a memorable performance. Momoa was the major standout there because he fit role well, understood it, and enjoyed it. 

Back to this film, Chalamet seemed to misunderstand the painfully dry delivery of most characters in Wes Anderson films. He left out the wit of that dryness and just delivered in a flat, bored, reporting quality for some lines that came off sounding like a high school play. Most characters in these films speak clearly and their beats are delineated by razor blades. It's part of the surreal quality they all share. He mushed everything...words and actions; most egregiously in the scene where he is playing peacemaker between the two women. Somewhat self-referentially hilarious that McDormand says his last line was, ""completely indecipherable."" Other times his delivery was tremulous and scattered, maybe intended to demonstrate a charming, passionate, awkward youth, but came off to me as a mess of a young actor eagerly trying to make a ""big choice."" I didn't sense any of the verve and vigor and sexuality called for by the character of a young revolutionary. He only had the look, and even that appeared bored and distracted most of the time. Most of the young guys in the barracks scene gave far more grounded and engaging performances, and I don't doubt some of them would have absolutely shined in the role of Zeffirelli...but of course, then you don't get the occupants of the girls' barracks coming out to see this film for their favorite fantasy boyfriend.

I knew nothing about this movie other than Thompson wrote it and the cast. So imagine my surprise when he starts dodging people who aren't moving for him I was like holy shit I think he's right. 

And that aspect of it was kind of interesting? It's a really weird movie to try and read into. I suppose after her transplant she wasn't feeling quite herself because a literal part of herself has been taken away. So her Golding hallucinations were not only her body coping with her new heart, but also this new part of her urging her to carry his torch of goodness and, in doing so, reconnect with her friends and family and make amends and just overall get her shit together. 

Okay, that's neat I suppose, but the bummer of it is that the movie just isn't that great. Like it has its moments where it's doing well, but they're short glimmers. For the most part everything needed to be either two points funnier or two points more emotional. The beats just weren't landing. And even though Clarke and her mad brows were doing great, the side characters were falling a little flat and the humor just wasn't very consistent. 

I mean, I didn't even really know what the movie was about until halfway through. It was just generally about how her life is shit and this weirdo keeps popping up. Wasn't much driving force or stakes behind it. And then it starts coming together when it starts feeling like an episode of The Good Place with her trying to be better, and it achieves an okay third act with a cute ending, but getting there should have been a lot more fun. 

Emma Thompson was the funniest character. But in the end this Elf/Ghost/John Q blend didn't really do it for me. I mean, look, I've got worse things to do than watch Emilia Clarke be a cute mess in an elf outfit for two hours, but I just expected more out of the writing.

Time travel movies usually have plot holes and I only saw one in this one, the goat. The goat should’ve been back the next day after she exploded it, but with no memories of her or that day, since that’s what happened to (at least) Nyles.  They could’ve written around that with her training the goat or some other animal somehow, and when it came back without the training she would know it had worked.

They did wrap up a grim ending brilliantly. Roy coming back and talking to Nyles 1 may have been enough to alter the timeline so that he doesn’t find the cave. Otherwise, Nyles 1 gets stuck in the loop all over again. Now, the 1 versions of everyone end up back in their pretty shitty lived, but the 2 versions at least get happy endings.

That girl was an example of a person having to break through personal morals. The Matron knew this girl had a problem with this subject, and that it would be something she'd have to be trained on, so she used her as an example of how every student - no matter how much all of them excelled as soldiers - has things they would be very much opposed against doing. For some it might be taking a life. For others it might be fellatio. Yet another might not be willing to harm a child.

Perhaps the 'failed' example would be better served to have a man perform fellatio on another man, but then you'd run afoul of homophobic tendencies in audiences. (It has sex, it has gore, but for some people none of that matters... but gay stuff does...)

It definitely did not help that they had no chemistry at all nor did she have any character traits. Having dated in closeted situations neither my partners nor I ever acted the way Harper did.  I think a lot of this also boils down to subpar writing.

Huh? You mean his account of how Freddie dies at the half point of the movie and then the other half is about how the rest of the band goes on to be the best band ever? I remember arguing at the time of production with many redditors, I said that even the notion that the film would kill Freddie in the middle was nonsense, that no studio would finance such a project and that the rest of the band would never have pushed for it. Instead, what was most likely, is that SBC simply gave the best face-saving account he could muster after being sacked from the role for whatever reason, making him look great and the band look like megalomaniac idiots. I thought some people would be here looking at how they were taken for suckers and whether they should be so gullible again, but nope, turns out even though the film shows they were completely wrong they were still somehow right, since ""this film is coming out in line with how people predicted from SBC's account of talking to the band"".

* >!They don't need to go to the island in the game to prove they used their source code, just look through the code. Also, when the villain bought their game company I am sure this would have covered his ability to use their code.!<
* >!Later, when the CEO (sorry no idea about the name) is trying to stop them why did he try to destroy the servers? He literally just rebooted all servers a few minutes ago. Just do the same thing but shut them down.!<
* >!When the CEO starts destroying servers the first whiff of smoke in a modern looking datacenter like that would have set off the fire suppression system killing him if he didn't immediately evacuate. Even if that didn't kill him he probably would have electrocuted himself. That many servers is no joke on the voltage. Also, very doubtful they would have an on-prem data center.!<
* >!Very doubtful a game company would launch a sequel and then just just down the original server. they would run both in parallel until the original lost enough subscribers. I think they still run EverQuest servers.!<
* >!Prior to the server room destruction, the protagonists just could have got the AI data from backups. Any company worth its salt would also have a secondary copy of backups offsite. So there was little danger of losing the AI. At any point, the Stranger Things dude could have just copied the backup files and ended the movie much sooner.!<
* >!Last, which is covered in the movie but bears repeating, fan bases of games have abandoned them and caused them to fail for far less.

Standout scenes with surprisingly very little talking, just excellent editing and acting:

* Cage talking to the 5 star successful chef about the pub he never opened. Damn, I was rooting for that guy. I know this is a fictional movie but the range of emotions that actor went through in that scene it was like you were right there with him and I left the movie hoping he went and opened that pub.

* Cage cooking that meal for the father who stole the pig and literally zero speaking, just a powerful performance as you can see him go through the emotions that the food brought back into his life by bringing up old memories. This scene ONLY worked as powerful as it did because about 15 minutes earlier there was a previous scene with such a simple yet powerful line of dialogue, ""Have you always been this way, or only after she died?""

All I am saying is I thought this was going to be a slow burn comedy, but this was actually a top tier drama that was riding on top of a sort of ridiculous concept, but the ridiculous concept only existed because the overall message.

48903,"Wow! This movie impressed me. The cast was great! Jon Hamm and Jeff Bridges were as good as they usually are. I expected Hamm to have a larger part, but I think that might have been an intentional subversion. You expect a guy like him to be the protagonist, not get blown away early. You know?

Hemsworth was great. His Thor charm and humor showed through when needed and he really had the perfect sinister vibe.

I don't really remember seeing Cynthia Erivo or Lewis Pullman in anything before, but they were both impressive too.

The singing scenes and other musical bits really felt like they fit, even though sometimes that stuff can feel like it's just thrown in.

This movie consistently got me with the twists and surprises, too. The various sudden gunshots made me jump. Billy Lee's arrival and Miles' reveal were both great.

There’s a lot of things to love about this movie, especially the way it portrays teenage culture, but to mention the thing that really stuck out to me: the tropes that it subverts and the very unique and real character problems that are presented. Like, Annabelle talking about how she’s accepted that the boys are going to call her hurtful nicknames, but it’s the *girls* doing it that guts her — that hit with me. Also, seeing a school genius get confronted about assuming that people who focused on other things were automatically not doing anything with their lives was great because I’ve never really seen it be flipped on them like that.

I think people are forgetting the conversation Steve and Diana have immediately before the big battle with Ares, in which he basically admits to her that humans are extremely flawed and possibly even inherently warlike, and tries to convince her that humanity is worth saving even if humans aren't perfect. For him to say that and then do the most selfless thing possible spoke volumes to me and I think that was what the movie was going for.

Steve is obviously a good guy but he doesn't always do what Diana would consider to be the right thing, and in fact the film goes out of its way to set up him trying to *stop her* from doing the right thing several times. Him being an imperfect man but, with his dying moments, making the most difficult but ultimately beneficial choice is what prompted her outburst of emotion IMO - and it's what ultimately prompts her to reject Ares' low opinion of humanity.",0

38778,"I just got out of the theater watching it. I've been hearing insane hype over this movie not only on reddit and online outlets but through the media as Sandler and KG did the press tours and word of mouth. Plotwise I went into it pretty blind as I wanted to save the viewing experience for the film. And boy am I glad I did because I absolutely loved this movie.

First off, the acting. From the first few minutes when Sandler appears on screen, I'm absorbed into Howard Ratner. I've historically thought of Sandler as an actor who plays himself in all his roles, comedy + punch drunk love otherwise, but when he steps into the jewelry store I only see a NY Jewish Jeweler obsessed with gambling. Everything from his glasses to the way he texts to how easily angered he gets to the look on his face when he's placing a bet, it all adds to the character and depth of who Howard is intrinsically as a person. Of course everyone else gives great performances, especially the unexpected KG and Julia Fox, but imo Sandler commands the movie with how deep into his character he gets.

It's also very busy, half of the movie is Sandler getting visited by his various debt collectors while trying to make deals or talking on the phone while trying to make a bet. All of this is supposed to add to the growing tension of how overwhelmed Howard feels but also keeps you on your toes and feeling nervous for what's going to happen next, which in my opinion is the mark of a great thriller.

The entire movie I kept thinking ""Is he going to get out of this? Or are we going to get a happy ending?"" I didn't know whether I wanted Howard to succeed or not. On one hand, nothing is going his way, he has so many opportunities to make things happen but all of them keep falling through or things keep happening. On the other hand, every time he gets an escape, every time he gets a bailout or a stroke of good luck, he flips it into another bet. All his watches he had loaned from KG's friend, all the pieces friends had let him borrow he keeps pawning into more bets. All of his unhappiness is brought upon himself, so I didn't really know what to expect. The big ending shot floored me though, just by the quickness and rawness of everything happening at once. I'm saddened by the end result, especially after knowing how much he found his purpose in betting and money (as seen in that last conversation with KG), but he did everything to deserve it. 

These are just my initial thoughts right after seeing the movie, I'm curious as to the deeper meanings of the movies that others will project, but ultimately it was very well done, an incredible, riveting story that keeps you on your toes and a performance from Sandler that will almost certainly get him an Oscar nom",0

42690,"Dr. Seuss is a man of considerable skill

A man with a passion to rhyme to his fill.

_

He wrote many books, of green eggs and ham

of cats in their hats, and of children named Sam.

_

A favorite to many is one perennial classic

read yearly by folks, who seek Christmas magic.

_

The Grinch is his name, he's mean and not boring

He hatches a plan, to steal Christmas' morning.

_

But he learned a good lesson, and thrice grew his small heart

He turned a new leaf, and started a new start.

_

A decade or so later, a cartoon was then done

From Chuck Jones and company, and oh it was fun.

_

Jump forward in time, about a decade or three

A big movie was made; an annual must-see.

_

That Grinch wasn't perfect, it sagged in the middle

But the end was so great; played my heart like a fiddle.

_

Fast forward again, to this present year

""Another Grinch?!"" you may say, but have you no fear.

_

Yes the previews look stupid, the ads all look trite

But surprisingly so, the end-result was no blight.

_

The beginning is great, devilishly funny

The middle less so, but still worth your money.

_

Then comes the finale, the stealing of Christmas

It differs from the book, but please just bear with this.

_

It has a light charm, that you can not deny

with slick animation and wit; I can't lie.

_

It changes the ending, but only a little

the spirit's the same, and again ""heart=fiddle.""

_

So what can I say about the new Grinchy flick?

Should you pass, should you rent, should you see it right quick?

_

I think parents with children will like it a lot,

if only to see the smiles on their tots.

_

And though it's not perfect, overall it's a win

If I had to rate it, I'd give it 8 out of 10.",0

I think this is why they reference Casablanca on the studio lot, and in the montage at the end, the plane flying across the globe to Paris was like Casablanca's imagery.

But think about it, Mia and Sebastian have a ""theme"" in the same way that Rick and Ilsa had ""As Time Goes By"" as their theme. Additionally, they do not end up together in much the same way, as they both have to live their respective lives and thus can't be together. Just like Rick and Ilsa will ""always have Paris"", Mia and Sebastian will always have Los Angeles. That ending was so sad and sweet, and it really made me think of Casablanca, even in the way that Mia's new husband seems like such a good guy, just how Victor was a great man in Casablanca, conflicting our feelings about the way the main couple does not end up together.

The Achilles heal of this movie is definitely the ending. What the fuck... The twist literally comes out of nowhere for no reason. Had they just escaped on the plane at the end, it would have ended up being a decent action film to me. Why did they feel the need to throw in that twist? It didn't tie anything together. It also made Iko Uwais's character much less likable, limiting the rewatchability. Lauren Cohen's send off was atrocious. Theres no real explanation and it really just wasn't necessary at all.

The opening scene with the raid on the russian safehouse was a strong start, but that, unfortunately, seemed to be the movie's peak. I'm not honestly sure what I was expecting from a Mark Wahlberg-starring action movie, but I was drawn in by Iko Uwais' name having seen The Raid 1 and 2. Iko's bone crunching physicality, however, was disgracefully butchered by an over indulgence in rapid cuts and shaky camera. The action doesn't get better with the gun fights either, they all boil down to c*ut to gun, cut to bullet hole, cut to other guy's gun, cut to another bullet hole, repeat*.

The action portion of this action movie was disappointing. What about the rest? Well, Marky Mark plays the character of Marky Mark with a gun, I guess? It's up to you whether or not you're into that. Overall, there were no blatant cases of terrible acting, but nothing was good. I can't even remember any of their names. The premise and plot were fairly basic and hard to mess up with a good ol' ""gotcha"" twist in the end, so the story was far from the worst aspect. With nothing else to elevate the story, whether it be good acting or good action, the movie doesn't stand out in anyway. You can tell at moments that the movie really tried to make some cryptic and dark comments on government affairs, but the closest it got was a couple presidential bobbleheads.

54780,"I really need to have an in depth discussion with someone who found this more than good because this film really fell flat for me in an all style/very little substance kind of way.  

Yes, the cinematography is breathtaking (saw it in 70mm) and the score is one of the best I've heard in quite some time (with Catch Hold and House of Woodcock being exquisite standouts), that being said, the whole foundation of the film is built upon a relationship I never really believed in at any point which makes the film feel practically soulless, with the only real charm coming from the score and performances.  

The main rule of film-making is show, don't tell, and I still can't think of any instance in this film where we're shown that the two actually love each other. You can see the cracks in the foundation from nearly the day after their first date night (e.g. ""STOP""), and before he's poisoned we get a less than 2 minute scene showing how ""tender"" he can be (via Alma's narration). That side of him really only comes out because he's so exhausted from completing his work that he barely has the mental fortitude to do or be anything more than an infant (which speaks to the themes of motherly nourishment throughout, I get it, but why? Because he's too engrossed in his work? ok, why? Because he yearns for a motherly figure in his life, ok, why?). If i'm remembering correctly, the only vague insight we gain into his attraction for her is her ""ideal form""...ok.  

She, on the other hand, well, I can't even venture a guess as to why she's attracted to him besides his prestige. Seriously, do we ever get any glimpse through her lens of desire for him? Then, once she realizes he's never going to tell her to fuck off, she decides to poison him to force him into her clutches so he can realize how much he really needs her. Which works, for a spell, like any other passion, before the aforementioned old cracks in the foundation start to show, at which point the cycle just repeats itself, for, what reason exactly? You probably get the gist of what i'm getting at by this point.  Though I will say, the slow zoom proposal shot was not only beautiful, but genius.

Also, can we talk about his relationship with Cyril for a second? Why are they so close? I mean, I get that brothers and sisters can be quite intimate, but in the context of this film, I felt like there was a scene left on the cutting room floor that told us a little more about the nature of said intimacy. A little allusion to them surviving the blitz or something to that affect would've gone a long way.  

Another thing I want to add is that I felt a little bit like an alien in my screening as I didn't feel this to be as much of a comedy as people are making it out to be. My audience (a nearly packed music box theatre if anyone is familiar) was practically uproarious, which I found odd as I was on edge nearly the entire time once the two met as I kept waiting for the other metaphorical foot to drop. In that respect I felt PTA did a wonderful job of encapsulating what Alma felt while living with Woodcock, which added more to the film than any comedy. Don't get me wrong, I thought it had it's fleeting moments of humor, but I would hardly call the film funny.  
All that being said, I found the film to be exemplary on a technical and sonic level, but the characters, and motivation came across as borderline elementary.  

A few final notes: I could watch the scenes of DDL driving on repeat for eternity. They were immaculately shot, and captured the feeling of driving/acceleration really well, which is something I usually find lacking in cinema.  
Lastly, did he know she was poisoning him in the end or was it just a little bit of ironic dialogue? I'm currently rolling with the latter, but will revisit that upon subsequent viewings. I just wish it ended right after he said ""kiss me before I become sick"". ",1

It felt like open-ended closure, if that makes sense. Even if we the audience don't see it because part 2 doesn't get made, it's still going to happen in the story.

28799,"I loved that unlike most adaptations As good as they are  it was about Little WOMEN plural not just Jo and her other sisters. Every sister had an arc and something to do. It wasn’t just the Jo show even though she is the main character. They were all well cast and the chemistry felt so genuine the interactions felt like actual sisters. 

I’ve always loved Amy even as a kid I thought her burning Jo’s book while cruel was so badass as well. I understand why she is unpopular with fans of the story my but her faults are also what make her so compelling she is a constant contradiction vain and self centred but also observant and warm and kind when she wants to be especially as a woman. Florence Pugh is a revelation in the role and I’m so glad her take on Amy is being appreciated by fans. I also find it fascinating  that the scene that is getting the most circulation is not a Jo scene but the scene with Amy and Laurie where she has her speech about what it means to a woman in the century. 

I think the studio will/should be pushing Florence Pugh for Best Actress in A Supporting Role. And Greta Gerwig for Best Director and/or Best Adapted Screenplay. The structure going back and forth in time works well and I never felt confused.

It also felt like the Laurie relationship was the most developed it has ever been. You can see from the get go why Jo and Laurie wouldn’t work. She never treats him as anything less than a brother. Everytime he tries to get closer to her she visibly gets uncomfortable. Amy and Laurie are a positioned as an adult relationship. He speaks to her maturely and I did get a sense of attraction/sexual tension in their scenes together. I also really like that Meg has more to do.",1

68202,"Chazelle is an absolute master at making ending sequences. There's a couple of wonderful layers to that scene:

1. Sebastian explains the origin of Jazz as a form of communication between people who didn't speak the same language. After 5 years apart, Sebastian didn't have enough words (nor time) in the world to describe his complex feelings to Mia, so he expressed himself through Jazz, sort of a secret language (which he taught her) that only she could fully comprehend at that time.

2. The 'alternate reality' sequence (which felt very much like the 'reality vs imagination' scene in 500 days of summer) was over the top Hollywood on purpose. Sebastian might be saying: ""Mia, I wish our lives could unravel like the movies you're so in love with, but reality is much different, and that's ok. We'll always have what we had"". It also felt like the director's love letter to old Hollywood. Both these elements echo back to the ""I'll always love you"" from the prior scene.

He already feels like an outsider due to not having money and  the same station and when they deal with something difficult and she isn’t interested in talking of the baby or sex he gets more detached from her and starts cheating. Which leads even more detachment and him feeling he just wants to get away from it all and her mother gives him and excuse to do it.

Okay, I have no idea why so many people feel this way. Its making me feel like I've forgotten large amounts of the first film. 

But I watched it two nights ago.

Melanie's role in the first film is extremely minor, like only slightly more important than the bully minor. I'd honestly be surprised if you told me she had more than ten minutes total of screentime.

Her only personality trait was that she had a crush on Cole, and that still existed in the second film. She had multiple lines which implied that she actually did like Cole, and was jealous of Phobe such as,

""Back there, the way he looks at you, that's the same way he used to look at me""

and

""I'm prettier than you"" 

Hell, her kiss scene with Cole makes no sense if she didn't like him at least a little bit.  
If anything, Bee's shift from evil (with hints of good) to completely good felt way more jarring than Melanie's shift did. In the first movie was that she was a psycho killer/demon who had a soft spot for Cole and in the second she's a lawful good martyr who only sold her soul to satan because she wanted to save a little girl.",0

54352,"Just saw the movie. I really enjoyed the movie but I couldn't tell  you why if you  asked me, so I'm writing a long post trying to get my thoughts down as to why I did enjoy it. I haven't watched anything like Lady Bird before so it was an intresting experience. There were funny scenes, sad scenes, scenes I could relate to and others not so much. I thought  the father character was hilarious, seems like such a stand up guy who loved his daughter, dispite the many hardships he was going through. The mother character seemed like a hard ass at first, especially with her comments such as ""you'll never get a job good enough"", but it made a little more sense when she told Lady Bird about her own mother. I could write a lot about all the characters (Kyle was funny although shallow, I felt bad for Danny because he seemed to lost when talking to Lady Bird about his sexuality, Julie was a great friend who seemed to be facing issues of her own that were not covered in the film unless i wasn't paying close enough attention) I'm on mobile so I'll just skip right to Christine ""Lady Bird"". Having graduated high school only 5 years ago, I felt like I could relate to a few things that Lady Bird went through. She seemed to have created unreal expectations in her own mind and was disappointed when they didn't live up to her own self-generated hype (losing her virginity, New York). She was trying to set herself apart from the rest by giving herself that nickname, but maybe trying a little too hard, something I did my senior year (trying too hard) lol. The ending seemed odd at first but after some thought I really liked it. Christine obviously matured (maybe just a little but none the less) when she realised what her family has done for her and how much she did love her hometown. My favorite quote in the movie was when Lady Bird was talking with the sister in her office ""Don't you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention?"" I guess why I liked it is because it felt real. Except for the portrayal of some of the high school parts, it felt very realistic that these are experiences someone in the modern day would be able to relate to. Heartwarming movie, I enjoyed the dialogue, and it kept me thinking a while after the movie was over.  ",1

Regarding her alcoholism, seems pretty clear Phil has driven her to it. Peter says she never drank before and I see no reason to doubt that. In the last scene she looks like she's going to be happy with George but Peter's smile into the camera does scare the shit out me.

5534,"I believe the different relationships in Luca all had different drivers, but it’s hard not to see a romantic interest, but specifically on the part of Alberto, and not necessarily from Luca’s perspective. 

Both Luca and Alberto were interested in winning money for the Vespa - but the ultimate personal drivers were different. 
Luca was interested in his friendships with Alberto and Giulia, fascinated with learning about the world, and aching for adventure. He was reveling in self-discovery.
Alberto, while similarly excited in adventure, started to discover a different driver; Luca himself. 
When Alberto started to discover that Luca seemed equally interested in spending time with Giulia, he became jealous, continuously trying to impress Luca, and reaffirm their (his) dream. 
Winning the money to buy the Vespa lost its value for Alberto when he started to notice they’d be sharing the dream with Giulia (or worse, Luca abandoning the dream to go to school with Giulia instead) Even though the dream of owning a Vespa was Alberto’s to begin with, the thought of it not being just him and Luca pushed him to risk abandoning that dream by revealing himself to Giulia. 

I also want to note that the story didn’t end with overwhelming fulfillment for Alberto. I believe the writers purposefully left Alberto in a place that’s not neatly wrapped up; there was no playing-up of Alberto finding any fulfillment - more of a “he’s good for now.” This could potentially keep things open for a sequel. And boy do I hope there is one.


I think, as with a lot of Pixar films, there is a message baked in as simple as viewing the beautiful art and music, and the simple joys of friendship, imagination, and discovery - but there are often deeper stories that open up the heart of the human experience. The stories don’t rely on one or the other, and can be enjoyed as deep or as beautifully simple as the viewer wants to go.",0

Haven’t seen this movie yet, but this is basically what Anderson always does. He has a neat trick of having the audience relate to his highly stylized characters through emotional “negative space” and pure situation rather than through the traditional ways humans convey emotion, the audience is straining to get to the emotional empathy that movies usually dish out so freely, so the moments of naturalism hit psyches that are as open as it’s possible for them to be, and it makes them shockingly intense for how subdued they objectively are.

**Things I loved:**  
 
Volk:  
 
The dance scene was by far, the most engrossing part of the movie. The choreography was fantastic, all of the movements were so raw and beautiful at the same time--contrary to Madame Blanc's insistance on dance *not* being beautiful. Moreover, the cinematography in the scene--specifically the overhead shots--were sublime. Those shots--and the alternate angles in general--added to the ritualistic/fantastique nature of the dance, I loved it. Kudos to Dakota Johnson and Mia Goth here, so captivating. And shout out to Thom Yorke--'*Volk*' was the perfect companion to the scene. The synths reminded me of Morton Subotnik's *Silver Apples Of The Moon* and I think that was a conscious choice on Thom's behalf, in that like Subotnik's work, *Volk* is alien, supernatural, and beautifully atmospheric. So great. A perfect scene. Definitely the highlight of the film for me. 

Acts II - V:  

I dunno about the whole 6 act structure + epilogue, but that's beside the point. From acts II - V I was completely glued to my seat. This is the core of the movie, and in it you'll find all of it's best parts. Aside from the Volk scene mentioned, another that sticks out as many others have liked to point out is Olga's torture. Super gruesome, and it wouldn't let you look away. Loved it. Another--when Sara explores the Witch's hideout. The lack of sound and feeling of impending doom kept me on edge. The camera movements reminded me a lot of David Lynch's *Mulholland Drive*, especially how the camera cautiously and slowly approached each corner.. Definitely made it the most frightening part of the film for me. Speaking of David Lynch, the dream sequences were phenomenal. Very reminscent of the horror films of the early 2000s--think of *The Ring*--with the quick cuts, brief moments of violence, and confusion they create.. The scene where the witches toy with the men is also a point of intrigue. True black comedy in that it is funny and terrifying at the same time. If only the rest of the film kept this balance... 
 
**This that I enjoyed:**     
 
The Acting:   
 
Stellar performances from Dakota Johnson, Mia Goth, Tilda Swinton, Angela Winkler, and most of the supporting cast. Chloe Grace Moretz on the other hand, is one of the most unforgivable aspects of the movie, and a complete miscast. There is absolutely no need to use a big name actor--let alone one who is poor at acting--for the role of Patricia. Double whamy of distraction. She's the single reason why the acting is part of the things I loved about the movie.   
  
 Cinematography:  
  
While it wasn't the most original, it was interesting enough to captivate. Subtle little things like adding a slight shake to the Kubrickian zooms were intriguing, and let the audience know that the film is aware of horror tropes, and is gonna mess around with those...     
  
**The bad:** 
 
The Score:  

The fault doesn't necessarily lie with the score--albeit it isn't *that* exciting--but rather how it was used. Anytime Thom--who leads one of the world's most popular bands for Christ's sake--sang, was sooo distracting. Using *Unmade* in the climax of the film is such a poor, poor choice. Especially in a scene that is already skewered by poor choices. I really don't understand how Guadagnino thought Thom's song and voice could be anything but a distraction.. Some have said that it made the scene tragic, and surely it might have, if the scene wasn't so stupidely over the top. If the scene had any sort of seriousness then maybe it would've worked... But it didn't. Not for me at least... And it plays right into the biggest flaw of the film: Tone.   
  
The Tone:  
 

This is my biggest gripe with the film. I think this is most evident with the climax of the film. Mother Markos, while presumably frightening to some, looked like nothing more than a slightly spookier version of Jabba the Hut. Not only did people in my theatre laugh each time she spoke, but they also chuckled during parts of the execution of the witches loyal to Markos. Truthfully, I do not blame them. How could you view that scene as anything but goofy? The CGI blood fest was far too over the top. Instead of evoking a sense of doom and disgust, I couldn't help but get angry at how silly it seemed. Perhaps the fault is in showing the gore and *not* leaving it up to the imagination? A sort of double-edged sword where I would be complaining if I didn't see enough blood? Maybe a singular, quick shot of the grotesque violence would have sufficied in making it terrifying? I dunno, it just really rubbed me the wrong way... After the scene, the first line we hear from one of the dancers is along the lines of ""Last night was crazy, I had way too much to drink"", which is comical/absurd, and could've have been sooooo God damn disturbing if the scene before it was so... But no. Similarly, the scene following the madness where Suzie/Suspirium goes to the old man's house... My goodness, where to start. Not only did his whole storyline drag the movie, but they had to finish him! Gosh, the monologue was so melodramatic, so cheesy! The deliberate juxtaposition of horror/serious drama and comedy can work--they do well in the cop scene mentioned above--but Guadagnino absolutely fails here. One moment we are greeted with a witch singing absurdly--as if she were in a JG Wentworth commerical--to prosthetic Jabba the Hut, to CGI'd head explosions, to Tilda Swinton's decapitation becoming a gag, to a soapy monologue about the death of one's lost lover... Muddled. Muddled, unsure, and deeply frustrating are the only words I have to describe this end... It's such a shame too, given how much a deeply enjoyed most of the film. In this way I think it pisses me off even more, because I know that the film COULD HAVE been a masterpiece, but it isn't, and it misses the mark completely...  
  
**Overall:**  
 
I really want to love the film. And at times I definitely did. But the errors in tone really take away from it, and the bottom line is that those errors practically zap away any chance that the film has at being a masterpiece.

Admittedly there are bits in the book where Oliver is on the lookout for passers-by so they aren't seen kissing etc 

I guess it's partly because of the artsy characters involved/potentially the location. Or maybe I had simply assumed everyone used to be homophobic across the board which evidently isn't true.

I had heard it had a sad ending so when I read the book (before seeing the film) I was dreading discovering Oliver had AIDs or something. It was a pleasant surprise that it wasn't the case.

I also really appreciate the depiction of Elio losing his... gay-virginity - ha! His nervousness, the tenderness etc. I haven't seen nearly enough LGBT films and as a bi person I'm really happy to finally see aspects that I've seen many times in depictions of straight couples.

It was outrageous. It was hilarious. It was genius. Everytime I thought I figured out where the film was going, it took another direction. The metaphors in the film are on another level. The cinematography in the film is beyond beautiful. The characters were so interesting! The intensity, the humor, everything was on point. 
But mostly I wanted to discuss the symbolism. I scrolled through a bunch of the comment section and didn't see anything relating to such so forgive me if this is common knowledge or if it's been said before. I just wanted to talk about it.

The table in the dining room. Such a huge center piece, but only 2, maybe 3 people actually sit at it at any point of the movie. But did anyone count how many chairs are at the table? There's 10 chairs. Symbolizing the rich have so much room at the table, but they don't share it. Stating there could have been space for the Kim family, the Park family and the maid and her husband in the basement.

The light switch that the man in the basement turned on whenever the Park's came home I think had some symbolism in the deed itself. How the lower class is always working for the man upstairs. Demonstrating how the rich see the poor: expendable. Even when it comes down to something as simple as a light switch. Can be forced out by excelling technology like actual sensors. (Maybe I'm stretching with this one, let me know)

Crossing the line. ""He never does cross that line"" Says Mr. Park refering to Mr. Kim. With several moments before Mr. Kim was being aggressive with his wife and shoved everything off the table. (Yes it was in a joking manner, but was it?) Throughout the entire movie, it foreshadowed Mr. Kim slowly breaking and crossing that very line. From driving in traffic (as Mr. Park was referring to) dealing with the man urinating on his street, and to arguing with his family... We see this snap slowly form but it becomes indefinite when he tries to take care of the basement situation, and unintentionally concusses the maid. Things go to shit (literally) with the Kim's home flooding in rain and sewage. And then ya know, several hours later his 2 children are dying. And Mr. Park is demanding the keys while trying to avoid the smell of the man who lived in the basement. All of this rage and misfortune has added up and he crosses a line he can't undo. Point of why I bring this up is that this foreshadowing was so subtle that it made the end result of this movie still wildly unpredictable. And that there's lines all cleverly captured between the rich and the poor and they never cross it because the rich like to keep that separate. Link to an example here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/f2hbd2/in_parasite_2019_literal_lines_are_used/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

And finally, the stink bugs. How the film is so cleverly titled Parasite, and the stink bugs represent the Kim family and how they are Parasites leeching off of the Kim family and their resources for survival and prosperity. But most importantly, most mind-blowing of all foreshadowing... Out of all bugs to reference this with at the very beginning of the movie, Bong chose a stink bug. And it is the smell and that reaction of Mr. Park that sets the whole finale ablaze. 

Thanks for coming to my Parasite talk. Maybe I'll get some sleep tonight. Maybe one day I'll stop thinking about the brilliance of this movie. But until then; feel free to share your thoughts and what you agree or disagree with in the symbolism of one of the most amazing pieces of the century.

To have *nothing there.* To not be able to *beat it.* I haven't really seen much of his films and I plan to do so now—if only to see him in more upbeat roles—because I can't see him in a different light atm.

Something goes wrong, this gangster tries to explain the fish thing but then says he doesn’t know what type of fish, then maybe people don’t believe him, and he gets whacked. Scorsese wanted to emphasize how paranoid these men could be and how close they were to being killed at all times.

There’s that really uncomfortable scene where Hoover asks Mitchell what he’d do if his daughter brought home a black man - and I got the sense that Mitchell fundamentally didn’t view the world in that way before being asked that. He seemed like a strict “law and order” type who didn’t see the Panthers from the race war perspective that Hoover was coming from. We get a lot of hints in the FBI scenes that Mitchell knows what they’re doing is wrong, but that person is gone whenever we see him tasking Bill with his next step (there seem to be a lot of parallels between the Hoover/Mitchell relationship and the Mitchell/Bill one). 

And yet all of that doesn’t matter, because the end result is the same whether or not Mitchell was as much of an overt racist as Hoover was - innocent people are dead. White supremacy survives and thrives not because of the Hoovers of the world, but because of the Mitchells - the people who put career advancement, law and order, whatever over right and wrong.",1

Jeremy Strong was pretty hilarious throughout. I loved Michael Keaton’s brief appearance as well. 

Great use of editing in this movie during the trial scenes loved the way it cut between flashbacks and people on the stand, different characters finishing sentences. 

The portrayal of the rivalry between Hoffman and Hayden was a great narrative thread that was pretty relevant to today. They both had good points and it was nice to see them sort of embracing each other in the final moments.

12823,"In the case of the Guccis, it was because they literally tried to become ""the new Italian royalty"" after the fall of the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy) in 1946. Their family got rich; and, thus, power-hungry.

Guccio Gucci, the Gucci patriarch - Maurizio's and Paolo's grandfather, and Rodolfo's and Aldo's father - was born in the era of the Kingdom of Italy (b. 1881, 20 years after Italian unification). He idolized the rich, famous, and especially royals, and sought the endorsement of the ruling [House of Savoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Savoy) for the Gucci company; possibly even an Italian knighthood for businessmen.

Guccio Gucci himself also originally worked for [Franzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franzi), the fashion house endorsed by the Savoy family, as well as the [Savoy Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Hotel) in London, and [Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compagnie_Internationale_des_Wagons-Lits). Franzi made its money by selling luxury goods to high-ranking European royals and nobles, which was a tactic that Gucci [later copied with selling luxury goods to Princess Grace of Monaco](https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/11026/how-grace-kelly-was-behind-one-of-guccis-most-memorable-prints).

However, when Italy became a Republic, and the Savoy royal family fled Italy, this left a power vacuum that greatly appealed to Guccio Gucci and his sons as an opportunity to elevate their family's wealth, influence, and social status. This is also indirectly referenced by Maurizio Gucci in the *House of Gucci* film, where he says, ""My family thinks they're royalty, but they're not.""

In the *House of Gucci* book, it's also mentioned that Rodolfo Gucci had originally planned an arranged marriage for Maurizio to the daughter of a wealthy Italian shipping magnate. Rodolfo basically saw his son as an ""Italian prince"", and himself as ""Italian royalty"", or high nobility.

To this end, in the 1950s, the Guccis also [adopted a ""family coat-of-arms"" as their logo](https://www.fixturescloseup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gucci-leather-goods-coat-of-arms-2.jpg), and proceeded to trademark the coat-of-arms so that it was synonymous with the family business.",0

It’s closer to the Jim Carrey grinch runtime but felt much more like the runtime for the original grinch cartoon. IMO that’s a good thing.

I think now that I've chewed on it a bit I think the biggest weakness of the sequel is that this movie lacks a lot of the emotional moments of the first film. We don't have anything that matches the moments from 1 such as the intense stress from the missile/jet scene, or it's aftermath where Bob thinks he's ready to finally kill someone, or his wife's suspicions of his adultery being washed away by his total devotion to her when she rescues him, or Bob's horror at discovering the truth and scale about the operations on the island and how many of his friends have died.

You can tell in interviews this film holds a really special spot in his heart. He hated not having time for it because of Avatar and having to give up directing.

But I enjoyed the movie much more than i thought i was going to, Its a fun movie, one i could stop and watch every time it appears on HBO or cable in the future. 

My issues (Beyond the timeline stuff, which i got to relax a bit with) was 1. How they portrayed his sexuality..i heard some laughs around me in the theater when the first narrative inklings of Freddie's homosexuality involved a dramatic truck stop bathroom scene. It felt like a nasty stereotype and unless theres a book out there that specifically cites an awakening in a truck stop bathroom for Freddie..it feels like a super weird choice. 

They really sugarcoated and gave the PG-13 version of Freddies later life. Drugs only alluded to once (powder on table). No real scene time consequence from the drinking.

The relationships between the characters seemed choppy and messy. Like one scene Freddie fires his manager for suggesting going solo, then 5 minutes passes and then he makes that decision anyway. In one scene he attempts to reach out to Mary but it appears that shes moved on with her life but then a few scenes later its mary that is trying to reach out to Freddie and the roles reverse. The way conflict arose just felt very disjointed, a lot of times it came out of nowhere...like there was a scene missing or something. 

But overall the movie is very watchable...like its a easy fun watch..not the Award type movie i was hoping months ago (Although i'd like to see at least an acting nod to Malek..he was fabulous) but still a fun popcorn type biopic.",1

My theater: almost empty.

But when I came out? Lines down the block for BOTH theaters (saw it at Times Square). So it seems like there was a great deal of enthusiasm. Or maybe none and those lines were somehow for something else? Weird.

Otherwise: I really liked it. I get that there will be a great nostalgia debate, and a rehash of 2016 culture wars, etc. But I thought the young actors did well, there was a clear story, good action and effects (including the surprising practical close-up on the dog), and obviously the fact that the whole thing is basically constructed as a tribute to Harold Ramis doesn't hurt when it comes to pulling the heart strings. Actually made it feel a bit Spielbergian (you can say if that's good or bad in the 'knows how to manipulate emotional responses' sense).

Overall though, I tremendously enjoyed it.",0

Guillermo del Toro is my favorite director. I absolutely love his style and his stories. The first half of the film felt at home in a Del Toro flick. The darkness. The production design. The second half slowed, but still had some Del Toro touches.  I don't know why but the man loves tile walls and floors.

Overall I enjoyed it. The ensemble of fantastic actors came together for a dark story that was foreshadowed early on.

I did leave the theater confused about Cate Blanchett character's motive behind the double cross.  I wasn't sure if she just wanted the money, or she wanted to get back at him for humiliating her during his show.

I thought the movie was good and the end kept me on the edge of my seat(not the very end but yanno where he's eating those girls and stuff.). Although there were some parts that I didn't think were super great, most of it was good. I liked the original idea, but I think it would have been much better if they didn't take it the ""supernatural""(I don't know if this is the best word/genre but whatever) route, like I think it could have had an even better effect if you knew that all of this could happen. I mean, it can, but with the exception of a guy with subhuman strength and like crazy skills. Speaking of said guy, I think that James did an amazing job in his part. Like, wow. It was crazy good.

41761,"One thing that really stood out to me the most watching this movie was the production value throughout. The concert scenes looked like something straight out of a concert film and I really enjoyed the extra scenes of the moments backstage such as when Ally walked through the stadium being lead by the assistant and the sequence of her performing in Saturday Night Live. It really felt like the studio had a lot of confidence in Bradley Cooper as a director and I feel like those moments made it feel like you’re a part of the performers on and off the stage as well.

And I feel like the main thing that makes or breaks a film like this is the chemistry between the lead actors. I thought the chemistry between Cooper and Lady Gaga was fantastic as well with Gaga stealing the show in every scene she’s in. This is definitely a breakout role for her and her voice is always a pleasure to hear. Cooper isn’t too bad either, I didn’t know the dude can sing but there he is. Lol",1

Oh, the dad loves him. Thanks trailer. Instead, I left with feels. Imagine if they ended it right there. Would've rivaled Toy Story 3.

I liked Ash's original song and Harambe's final songs the best. So glad he didn't stay with ~~Won't Back D~~Stay With Me my god I hate that song. All Of Me would've been *ok* too but the one they went with was the best, I think it was Elton John.

Can anyone with a better ear for it tell me if Melodyne was used here for the singers? The voices seemed so natural and I didn't hear many artifacts (I heard some on Tori's) but I'm not too familiar with how natural-sounding melodyne can make them. But some of it seemed too good to be true.

The sound was seriously amazing.  >!The scene where car 21 blows its engine on Mulsanne straight really built the tension with the straining sounds of the engine.!<

The dynamic between Bale and Damon as Miles and Shelby, respectively, was awesome.  The humor of the film really seemed to play with the legend of Carroll Shelby.  Bale seemed right at home playing ""the Bulldog"" with an explosive temper while still maintaining a sweet side.

Tracy Letts playing the straight-faced Henry Ford II really let's Damon be his most humorous, especially the >!""we got Enzo right where we want him"" scene!<

Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca worked well, I just wish we got to see more of him.

The movie really has enough human interest to it to entice the uninitiated to auto racing, and has more than enough car porn to interest the gearheads.

There’s definitely some fair criticism about this movie - but I disagree that it’s aim at the media, politics and the wealthy was ‘low hanging’. I thought it was a hyper-realistic assessment of where we find ourselves, and if it appears on the nose it’s probably because we as a society are

The concept was interesting but read as pretentious. Two well-read, French teenagers having sex won't bring peace to the world, much less their town, much less heal the rift between the younger and older generations.

Benicio del Toro's piece up top was very engaging, along with Owen Wilson's intro that laid the scene. The third story might have been my favorite, however, I also felt like Murray's character towards the end. Wright's incredible narration about food and the shots within were so engaging, I wanted *more* of that, maybe a piece strung together with more food/drink.

I loved La La Land enough to the point where I saw it 4 times in theaters. It's easily in my top ten favorite movies ever. The musical numbers in it were top notch.

Each of the songs in Greatest Showman felt like a Katy Perry ""anthem"" made to sell the soundtrack. I'm seeing a lot of people here loved the music, and that's fine. I was just hoping for more music like in La La Land, not like on top 40 radio.",0

I think the film was very ""slice-of-life"" and so the plot points feel fairly subtle or almost non-existent, but they're there.  There was the whole storyline of the mother coming to grips with her relationship with her husband, and telling the children, and you also had the fairly significant thread of Cleo and Fermin.  This is among other things.

I've heard similar criticisms levelled against films like There Will Be Blood and The 400 Blows.

But it was so well written and so cold hearted that you could tell she was only after the money and saw the whole thing as a way to make more money from a poor father.

But I gotta say, after reading about the guy, how the hell can they choose to make a movie about him being a good, dedicated father when the scumbag abandoned 5 of his other first kids???? Looks like he was a good father to Serena and Venus (hence the movie), but if you abandon FIVE of your first kids, by no means can you ever be regarded as a good father let alone have a movie named after you portraying your fatherly figure as positive. 

Even Serena and Venus being onboard for this doesn’t make sense when you account for his behavior towards his other kids. 

Just read this article featuring his eldest daughter.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.the-sun.com/news/229940/serena-williams-half-sister-dad-left-mom-six-kids/amp/

As a movie, 4/5, cause I felt they should have showed a little bit more of Serena Williams’ path forwards becoming the best ever, as they focused more on Venus’ path (probably cause she was older). 

You finish thinking, oh this was a good guy, wanting the best for his kids, made sure they enjoyed their childhood too without pushing them too much. But nope after reading he abandoned his other 5 kids (supposedly has a bunch of other kids he’s probably never paid child support to), as a father the guys a scumbag.",1

But the more I think about it, the more I like how it puts a pretty smart critique of corporate culture smashing individualism and generational wealth in there along with all the story beats of this kind of movie. Obviously, Miles loses Le Mans because he agrees to go along with some marketing push, limiting himself because he wants to just help the team. The ostensible villain of the movie (in America, at least, given the title) is Enzo Ferrari. But he isn't the villain at all. He's just someone dedicated to his art (so dedicated he bankrupts his company) and loses when the bigger company decides to crush him.

And I loved Tracey Letts' performance as Henry Ford II. The character postures and acts like a corporate titan but that moment in the car when he's crying shows he's just trying to prove to his father (and grandfather) that he can run the company. He didn't build the company or earn his way to the top, it's just some game so he doesn't look like daddy's boy to the other car owners. It's all just for show, like where Ferrari sits and watches the whole race Ford decides to helicopter out for a nice dinner.

The only sour note is Josh Lucas, who really overplays the moustache-twirling villain role. Some of the writing was clunky, sure, but it's a bit overdone and out of place in this movie.

I don't think it's hidden at all but it's a nice addition to what could have been a run of the mill underdog story.",1

The leg work the FBI did to destroy and dismantle just about every black empowerment  movement crushes me every time I'm reminded of it. My mother was an angel, but what she endured when she moved from Jersey to Georgia was terrible. Racists being in power have this God-forsaken phobia of minorities, and the means to which they will take to eradicate any movement is absolutely ridiculous. Hoover and racists like him always made it seem like the safety of the country is dependent on minorities being oppressed (a tactic still used till this day). But, each movement (NAACP, Black Panther etc)  was sparked by the murder of Emmitt Till and the thousands of other senseless murders of minorities. This country will never get to where it needs to be until the powers that be listen with open ears to people who can convey the ""Black"" experience properly with the goal of putting pieces in place to eliminate this state and corporate-sanctioned bigotry hatred. This America that we are in now is better than the one my mother grew up in, but we still have a lonngggg way to go.

This film did a great job of conveying why the Black Panthers existed; It was never to push fear, only preservation. Hampton Jr. was robbed of a father, the nation was robbed of a Kennedy, of a King, all because of this phobia of minorities.

I strongly disagree.

The bully, though, [on the left in the black shirt](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ifhMFLXwZsU/maxresdefault.jpg) has darker skin than Chiron, and certainly much darker than any Kevin, as well as different hair textures and hairlines. ",1

18199,"Finally able to share my thoughts with a wider audience now that the discussion is live. I caught this early January.

As a straight male, this movie resonated with me in ways unimaginable.

I don't think its recency bias in the slightest, but as soon as the credits started to roll, wiping the flood of uncontrollable tears, I thought to myself: *""Yup. This is one of the most beautifully moving films I have ever experienced and an immediate Top 5 favorite of mine.""*

So much is said without anything every being said; the film is its loudest, most loving, and most intelligent in its quietest moments. The scenes between Marianne and Heloise during their sessions, especially the one where Heloise questions ""And who do I look at?"" were magnetic despite being such tender, whisper-soft moments.

There are several scenes that are still imprinted in my mind that I cannot shake, but, above all, those final 10 minutes, but more so those final 4 minutes, during the orchestra, as the music swells and we see a range of emotion play out on her face...it's unreal.

67993,"I just saw this movie today and I honestly have to say, this was by far my best movie of 2016! This movie charmed the hell out of me and was able to pull off something I've really never seen in a movie which was being able to be at times a huge spectacle of a movie while, also being very quiet and reserved at others.

Stone and Gosling have some of the best chemistry I've seen in actors in years past and I loved how well they worked off of each other.

The soundtrack was amazing and even though I only saw it not even 6 hours ago I already have pretty much every song on my phone and have had it on repeat for ours now (I think my personal favorite is A Lovely Night, that scene was amazing.)

However, I think my favorite thing about this movie is that on the surface it completely seems like just another musical but, if you just look a little deeper it has some really strong things to say about chasing your dreams and relationships and the fact that the two don't always intertwine. I think this movie was probably the best example I've ever seen of the quote, ""if you love something let it go."" Sebastian easily could have not told Mia about the audition and just let her live at home with her parents and give up but, he cared about her just enough to know that she needed to achieve her goals even though he knew what that meant for their relationship. He was willing to let her chase her dreams as she had forced him to chase his and put her wellbeing and happiness before his even though he knew what would happen to them if she got the role and if that's not love, I don't know what is.   

While I know some people hated the ending, and it is quite bittersweet, I actually found it quite refreshing. Though it was sad that they didn't end up together and I found their love story to be one of the most compelling I've ever seen, I realized, neither of them would have gotten what they truly wanted if they stayed together. It showed in the alternate reality that Seb wouldn't own a club and would instead have been still sitting with Mia watching somebody else live out his dream while Mia would still be struggling. I think it shows they needed each other to push each other and have somebody to lean on but, once they each found steady footing that initial need was lost. I think it's a great message that even though a relationship may not last, it doesn't mean you should regret it or that you never needed each other. Neither of them would have gotten where they ended up without each other, they were both just a very important part of each other's bigger story.",1
62037,"It's a very short score.

I've always liked the Christopher Gunning scores better, this was okay as background music, but it does not have a theme as strong as the one Gunning wrote. I think Gunning's approach was much better. He chose a saxophone, invented by a Belgian, to represent Poirot and made it the identity of a character. It was a clever histrionic way of nodding to the character and also using it to explore musical ways to express Poirot's inner workings.",0

her son, that didn't have a job, didn't dress in an appropriate way, was under her roof?

the mother asks the father if the son and his girlfriend have sex on the pullout.  The mother doesn't knock, walks right in to a teenager's bedroom, right in on her in the bathroom... but hasn't walked into her living room while her son is there? That is a boundary issue.

I think the mother falls on the narcissist range. The nun shows actual maternal actions/feelings towards ladybird/Christine. 

now, contast how they react with her, and how she reacts to them. The nun understands the situation, sees the humor in it, and actually lays out reality, without screaming, with out threats, without blame. Ladybird/Christine actually listens.  

The mother forces the daughter to go to a religious school because of fear of the real world and then yells at her for the price of the school. That is more than just a bit shitty. if anyone said, ""hey, I want to take you to an amazing band and i'll pay the ticket"".... and then during the show you find that you don't like the band so much, if your friend should scream at you, ""why don't you appreciate this, I spend so much money"". they'd be a dick. How does ladybird react, like a normal teenager. ""ok, you want to keep bringing up how much this costs... fine, tell me how much it costs... come on, you keep asking me if I know how much, you tell me... then, after I get out of here, I'll pay you back and never have to see you again"".

The mother is only happy about the son because he came back home.  The mother sheltered the daughter so that she could never leave, never have her own life, and when threatened with having her own life... the mother cuts her out. like a parent and child cannot be separate people.",1

Good film.

Not bad, but not great. IMPO I think Cartoon Saloon's strongest films are Song Of the Sea and The Breadwinner.

Strengths.
Art. every shot...*chefs kiss* every shot is like a desktop wallpaper for me.

Characters. Robyn, Mebh, and Bill(father) play their expected roles. A wannabe hunter, a feral defensive child, and an overprotective fearful dad. But what makes them better than archetypes, is that they play their archetypes stories differently. Mebh is curious, playful, and yet defensive about her mother. Robyn wants to be a wolf hunter, but abandons it, society, and her father to be a Wolfwalker in the woods. Overprotective father, instead of rage being a usual depiction of this from a male parent. We see Father, actually be crippled in fear by Lord protector, and is on the verge of tears when Robyn is crying about being forbidden to leave or do anything other than what Lord protector or what he says.

Themes of fear. Initially, wolves/forest/nature are to be feared in the beginning of the film, but as our character Robyn spends time with Mebh and becomes a Wolfwalker she learns that its more freeing to leave society, and makes the painful decision to leave her father, with her sleeping body (emotional scene). And later her Father leaves society too.
Interesting points.
The thing I enjoy about having Father and Robyn be English, is that they are not completely welcomed in Ireland during the setting of the film(colonialism), and Father works for Lord Protector. The Irish dont bother to hide thier disdain/hate for Lord Protector, but follow his orders due to severe punishment and fear. So in a sense Robyn and Father become ""Irish"" at the end of the film by fighting Lord Protector, and going away with Mebh and her Mother, and embracing the Wolfwalker way.
I found the ending bittersweet, cause while the setting is historical (but not completely). Ireland's native wolves have been extinct, cause of the real Lord Protector. So...while at this point of time in the film the Wolfwalkers succeed, we know they dont cause wolves will be gone from Ireland.

Weakness.
Too simple.
""Girl finds nature side, and embraces/leaves society.""
That pretty much sums up the movie.

Father: while I understand Father is overprotective because he is a father, we dont see why he is at that extent. And If anything Father's choice to become a Wolfwalker (I say choice, cause of his choice to leave society. Not on attacking Lord protector,  because any good parent would fight to the death against anyone trying to kill their child) is fueled by his over protectiveness to Robyn. So... idk on how to feel about that.",0

I'm not squeamish when it comes to violence but the part where that meathead GI-Joe picks up a fallen comrade and uses him as a human shield.... it's almost disrespectful at that point. I get it's important to understand how horrific the battlefield can be, but you can't spend an hour of the film talking about god and being a pacifist, then spend another hour glorifying brains exploding, eviscerations, and burning Japs doing flips.

Hey and what's up with Vince Vaughn's second rate impression of Lee Ermy. The casting didn't make sense to me.

Sooooo he plays handball with a grenade and gets pulled off the battlefield and at the same time they take the ridge, by the way the Japs surrender too and they commit sepeku.

I prepared myself that Lady Gaga may not win best actress, although imo she deserved to.....but to NOT award Cooper with best actor was a travesty. Malik was okay as Freddy, but he did not actually sing. If he, Malik that is, had an ounce of integrity, he would have thanked the foreign press, said that he worked hard on Bohemian, but RECOGNIZED that the award belonged to Cooper, walked off stage and placed said award in front of Cooper.

17707,"The court transcript is available online and this trial really was a travesty of justice. 

I think this movie did a serviceable job in toe-ing the line to portray an infuriating situation without coming off as ham-fisted (i.e. making the prosecution cartoonish-ly evil and the defence cartoonishly good). In my opinion, the events speak for themselves without needing to take artistic license with the characters of anyone involved. 

However, these moments in particular felt contrived.

1) The final scene of Hayden reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers did not happen as far as I'm aware, and the change from what really happened seemed unnecessary. The actual closing statement made by Kunstler is really powerful, and I'll quote it at the end. 

2) The moment where Hoffman talks about pronouns and how he has actually read all of Hayden's publications was sort of a ""wink at the camera"" moment. 

3) Ramsey Clark's portrayal was a caricature. Making him a casual give-no-fucks badass was satisfying to watch as a viewer, but definitely was playing to the audience's sympathies. 

4) One of the most confusing additions is David Dellinger punching the deputy, which did not happen in real life. Dellinger was a radical pacifist and this addition is offensive. 

5) Showing Fred Hampton being murdered during the time of the trial - when he was murdered over a month later. 


-----------------------------------------


General thoughts:

I enjoyed the decision to humanize JGL by showing his internal struggle between his ethics and duty to the law- though I'm not sure as to the veracity of this.

Incredible performances by Judge Hoffman, Seale, Kunstler, Dellinger, Hayden, and Strong in particular. Eddie Redmayne pulled off a great accent, while surprisingly I felt that Sacha Baron Cohen's accent was a little sloppy at times. 

Sorkin is a master of dialogue, and could have done without some of the snarky whispers that are really directed at the audience. 	Most of Lee Weiner's dialogue consisted of these quips.

-----------------------------

All-in-all, the events that happened are really so absurd that it must have been hard to convey their realism. Things like Hoffman/Rubin wearing the robes, the treatment of Seale, gross bias from the judge, etc. 

The verdict of the trial in reality was not a feel-good moment, and I'm still confused as to why it was portrayed as such. Along with the sentences, the judge ordered the long hair of the defendants AND defense attorneys to be forcibly cut due to being deemed offensive. The real life events left many people angry, and I believe this movie should have left the viewer feeling angry as well - if true to history. 

-----------------------------

Parts of the closing statement from the (real life) trial:

>  ""When a new truth comes upon the earth, or a great idea necessary for mankind is born, where does it come from?  Not from the police force, or the prosecuting attorneys, or the judges, or the lawyers, or the doctors.  Not there.  It comes from the despised and the outcasts, and it comes perhaps from jails and prisons.  It comes from men who have dared to be rebels and think their thoughts, and their faith has been the faith of rebels.
    ""What do you suppose would have happened to the working men except for these rebels all the way down through history?  Think of the complacent cowardly people who never raise their voices against the powers that be.  If there had been only these, you gentlemen of the jury would be hewers of wood and drawers of water.  You gentlemen would have been slaves.  You gentlemen owe whatever you have and whatever you hope to these brave rebels who dared to think, and dared to speak, and dared to act.""


> An intolerable war abroad has divided and dismayed us all.  Racism at home and poverty at home are both causes of despair and discouragement.  In a so-called affluent society, we have people starving, and people who can't even begin to approximate the decent life.
    These are rough problems, terrible problems, and as has been said bv everybody in this country, they are so enormous that they stagger the imagination.  But they don't go away by destroying their critics.  They don't vanish by sending men to jail.  They never did and they never will.
    To use these problems by attempting to destroy those who protest against them is probably the most indecent thing that we can do.  You can crucify a Jesus, you can poison a Socrates, you can hand John Brown or Nathan Hale, you can kill a Che Guevara, you can jail a Eugene Debs or a Bobby Seale.  You can assassinate John Kennedy or a Martin Luther King, but the problems remain.  The solutions are essentially made by continuing and perpetuating with every breath you have the right of men to think, the right of men to speak boldly and unafraid, the right to be masters of their souls, the right to live free and to die free.

While Nicole was the bigger asshole during the divorce, I came away from the movie fully believing that Charlie was the bigger asshole during the marriage and that the movie is truly Noah's reckoning of his role in his marriage's downfall.  The cheating thing is much worse IRL and I feel like it was dumbed down for this movie to make Charlie *less* of a villain, I don't think it was introduced to make Nicole sympathetic.

That being said, the real ""culprit"" of the divorce was their lack of direct communication and their lack of comfort with being honest with each other.",1

I also felt like it wasn't grim enough, and I wasn't sure of the point of her van breaking down and her visit with her sister to get the money to repair it.

I'm really not sure what to get from this movie other than this how some people live, and some of them in order to process grief. It was nice to look at though, and makes me want to visit some of the locations.  Maybe it'll click when I'm older. I usually like these character studies.",1

17004,"Just my personal thoughts. I think the pointlessness in her not killing the men does have a place in the film.

In the scene where the guy calls her ""the psycho Jerry took home"" there was an air and dejectedness with her after. She could justify it to herself before but not anymore. Her motivation for her bar stuff was guilt from not being able to save Nina. She was punishing herself.  The film deals with her realising that her revenge doesn't actually fix anything or make her feel better.

For me theres an air of sadness about some bits, especially with her parents and Nina's mom. Sometimes it feels like shes crying out for help but they just tell her to move on rather than actually try to help her. (Though it's more understandable with Nina's mom as Cassie's not moving on keeps reopening old wounds)

I dont think the movie is glamorous what Cassie does. Like her reactions after the scenes with Madison and the Dean. And the script says that the whole thing starts to scare her. That why she tries to move on with Ryan. But finding out his involvement broke her and she goes back to her self destructive ways.

There were emotions in this film that I recognized in myself.  But that's just my own thoughts",1

There were moments of high-octane ultraviolence, but they were woven between drawn out moments of compelling character interactions. The biggest negative I could think of were the scenes where the cgi really stood out as unrealistic. Particularly during the last act. They didn't detract from the overall experience, though. 
I watched the film this afternoon in Busan, and I was one of the last ones to leave the theater along with a middle-aged Korean woman. We shared the elevator out of the theater and she was just wiping away the tears. It was a powerful ride, regardless of anyone's dedication to the X-Men series.

What do ya'll think of the overall messaging of the film? So I'm someone who definitely does believe in tarot cards and psychics. I totally believe that there are a lot of things in this world that we don't fully understand. That being said, I think it is important to have some level of skepticism when it comes to things like this. Stanton does a great job of manipulating people and telling them things that will comfort them as opposed to speaking the truth. 

The time period is also so important to this. Just 10 years ago the great depression was happening and now they're being plunged into world war 2. People need hope and comfort and they always turn to things they don't really understand, like some loud voices in religion, certain political parties, and yes even psychics and fortune tellers. 

I've noticed that in our own hard times, people have reverted back to these same things again. There certainly is an increased focus on spirituality, astrology, mysticism, and other things as well since the pandemic started. There's nothing wrong with believing in any of this, but I hope people are smart with who they trust. 

This is turning into a rant now but this movie was very very timely. I wish more people would watch it. It's such biting commentary. I know for the original version, it was a flop at the box office too because I don't think people wanted to be faced with the fact that some of these figures aren't very trustworthy.

There's also a contrast between Laramie and miles, as they both are faced with an option to interfere or not. Both make the choice to interfere, but the outcome in the case of Laramie shows the world doesn't necessarily care about the morals behind your choice.

Billi is effectively our eyes and she cant comprehend certain things. There is exposition but I was happy with the uncle being the main culprit as it fitted his character. His speech regarding them taking on the burdens of her illness was great IMO. 

I did feel her mom was more obvious with it and the sole point of her character though.

So overall it is a bit heavy handed but some people don't see the subtleties as easily and the film needs to be accessible for neutrals. 

It's not just being shown in West but also in the East, as much as we're learning about Chinese culture, Chinese film goers will also want to see another point of view.

As a casual (far from hardcore) fan, I was quite disappointed in the coverage. Would have liked to see much more on the post-Cale albums (especially the 1969 self-titled) and on the reunion. Doug Yule is once again completely memory holed. So unfair given that he was nothing but a professional and had a major part to play in two excellent albums that have a place in music history. No mention at all of the Velvets' significance in Eastern Europe: [https://www.kcrw.com/music/articles/how-the-velvet-underground-influenced-the-velvet-revolution](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/) and how that played into how they were received in the 90s right after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Very little screen time for Moe Tucker. No Laurie Anderson (she must have refused to participate but her absence is glaring). Reed's sexuality is treated awkwardly, almost with embarrassment. Not even a nod to Candy's trans identity in ""Candy Says."" I could go on.

There were some really moving and interesting parts, especially about Cale and Reed's childhoods, reactions from audiences while on tour, East and West Coast rock rivalry, Nico's aspirations, and so on. The visual style is effective, suits a prestige doc - but it's too niche and experimental as an intro to the band and too cursory for fans. It should have been a two-parter for streaming like last year's Laurel Canyon rather than trying to cram everything into a 2-hour theatrical feature.",0

17329,"Unfortunately, I didn't boogie with this movie. It just didn't captivate or intrigue me. And it's not an instance of ""oh, I've seen something like this before that's lesser known and was done better."" I just simply... was bored. I'll try to explain:

I was a bit put off by the relationship of the leads in the opening. The scene where they're first driving and we're peering in from the back seemed like improv, which okay, great, but it seemed like it was from a place of a couple barely getting to know each other. At that point, I had no idea how long they've been together so I can't quite judge, but it turns out they've been together for 4 years. So off the bat, it's not entirely ringing true to me.

I feel like there's been talk of Riz Ahmed for a few years now being such a great actor. Am I missing something? Is he on a show that I just don't watch? Everything I've seen him in, he's been surface level at best. Venom and Rogue One are obviously the most mainstream and flat performances, but even in Nightcrawler I just thought ""yeah, he's decent."" And here, which I would say is his best performance so far, he still seems a bit performative like he's dramatizing his emotions a bit to be captured instead of naturally living the scenes as they go. A bit extra twitchy and eye move-y and such that some actors do to make it look like they're conveying an emotion instead of actually having one. I could get more into the technicalities of acting, but for the sake of simplicity, I won't.

The writing seemed a bit awkward with how people interacted with each other. Especially with how Ruben's character is at this place to cope with his hearing loss, he was pretty much a prick to everyone for the first half of the movie. He doesn't desperately do whatever he can to learn from others, instead he's scoffing and acting non-plus by everyone. He wants to go back to his old life, yet isn't willing to take the steps to get there? Dude just seemed like a douche for no reason, it didn't ring true, his behavior honestly didn't look like he'd willingly be there under any circumstances if that's how he acted, even if it was for his girlfriend.

I thought Paul Raci was pretty great, could definitely see him securing a nom for Best Supporting. I think he's one of my only main positives about this movie. At this point midway into the movie, my score is hovering around a 6 or a 5, but after Paul Raci's final scene (which is the scene I think could be his nom securing moment), this movie dipped to a 4 or a 3.5 for me as it suddenly nose dived into a place that just worked even less for me.

Olivia Cooke was... fine. I was waiting for her to have a really good moment. Her character didn't ring true to me either. The transition at the end to assimilating to that lifestyle just didn't seem believable. Their nomad/gypsy lifestyle before just seemed to cleanly be gone. While this happens to many people and they go through phases, I think the very idea that this was something she did for money, I don't see it easily being stripped clean from her personality like that. The ""old her"" seemed almost completely gone. Just a different look in her eyes all together and like a new character, which I'm sure is the point but in that time span it just felt like forced for the sake of the movie and to help jolt our lead's acceptance of his situation.

Speaking of which, the final scene of him just kinda coming to terms in some sort of way, learning to deal with his new situation and realizing his old life will never come back? The overwhelming sound of the bells seemed too easy. This dude went through a lot of turmoil, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, and did a whole lot just to retain that tiny bit of hearing. With what we've seen of his character's behavior before and his frustrations at that party and the way his girlfriend suddenly seems fine not living their old lifestyle, this acceptance coming in this moment felt fake for the sake of a movie moment. This would be something he'd be visibly frustrated with for years to come and seems like the actual thing he would NOT accept. Yet I'm supposed to believe he finds his moment of stillness in one scene? Comparing this to another drummer movie about obsession, Whiplash perfectly captured a dickhead we could root for because it was easy to understand him and care by seeing how willing he'd put up with shit. I don't think I ever understood Ruben or cared, because in the beginning he seemed so unwilling to do anything. Dude didn't even tell his girlfriend he went deaf until a whole day after.

And the whole ending in general was so lackluster compared to the rest of the movie. I was now realizing a lot of scenes throughout just came and went and happened without any impact to the rest of the story, or dragged even if the movie had a pretty decent pace in editing. It was around this point that I really wished we got to see the documentary this is based on instead as that would at least have some natural catharsis.

4/10, and if that's if I'm being generous. I can see myself forgetting I even saw this movie in a few days and dropping this to a 3. This Oscar season is already shaping up to be pretty terrible, but I guess that only makes sense considering its 2020 and coming off 2019 as one of the best.",1
14685,">	 the structural causes the got them there in the first place

The backdrop of the film is that a single company decided it wasn’t profitable to stay open and an entire town vanished over night. Just because it doesn’t beat you over the head with it doesn’t mean the point that capitalists making capitalist decisions isn’t what left hundreds - if not thousands - of people stranded.

If the film idealizes the nomad lifestyle, it’s because Fern intentionally seeks out and surrounds herself with people who *want* the lifestyle, of which there are plenty. There are multiple examples in it of how one unexpected incident is a catastrophe; Fern being able to get bailed out by others doesn’t mean it doesn’t highlight how lucky she is that that’s the case.

Kinda feels like you missed some pretty core themes more than you’re highlighting flaws with the movie. You definitely didn’t read Bruder’s book.",1

49856,"The release of *Paddington 2* is a bigger deal to me than the next installment of Star Wars or Marvel or what have you. Even though I am a grown man, *Paddington* is my favorite movie. I was cautious about spoilers for months and wore my duffle coat to an late night showing the night before release day in the US. I am happy to report that I loved *Paddington 2* even with all that anticipation. 

*Paddington 2* continues the same standard of excellence set by its predecessor for rich visuals, character animation, and clever wit.  Generally speaking, the movie is a colorful feast for the eyes with neat uses of animation and effects throughout. The pop-up sequence in the beginning is marvelous. There is broad and subtle humor in abundance, and it is evident that filmmakers have mastery of both. Rather than go through every gag I liked, suffice it to say that every joke landed for me; there is just so much good comic material. Some highlights that immediately come to mind are the marmalade making scene, Paddington's mishap in the barbershop, and the hilarious mid-credits musical number.

I continue to be impressed by how well Paddington is animated. The character animators succeeded yet again at making Paddington cute, funny, and sympathetic. For that matter, all of the bears are well animated and seamlessly composited into the live action footage. Once again Ben Whishaw is perfect as Paddington's voice. He was a great find back when Colin Firth dropped out of the first movie. Whishaw is so good it feels like should have been in that role from the get-go; I can't imagine a better voice for Paddington. High marks also for the other actors, especially Hugh Grant who expertly walks that line between menace and comedy just like Nicole Kidman did in the first one.

This sequel is even more of a tearjerker than the first movie. I sobbed during Paddington's arrival at prison and the silent underwater goodbye between Mrs. Brown and Paddington when they briefly resign themselves to his fate before reinforcements arrive to help rescue him in the nick of time. A few other scenes also made me tear up. With all the comedy and the melancholy, it is quite the emotional roller coaster, in a good way. 

Of course, I got all choked up again for the ending, but those were happy tears. What a perfect ending it is. I thought it was a good choice to end the film right there on a tender note rather than trying to tack on an additional peppy scene.

And finally, the music. The soundtrack has already taken up residence in my regular listening rotation where it is sure to stay, just like that of the first movie. The return of the diegetic calypso band was not unexpected but certainly welcome, with a new set of tunes I thoroughly enjoyed.

Now there are two movies I call my favorite, and they both star a darling little bear from Darkest Peru. *Paddington 2* is as good a sequel as I could have asked for. Heartwarming, wholesome fun. Just perfect. 10 jars of marmalade out of 10.",0

Most scenes were just medium shots and inserts, even in scenes that could have been potentially very interesting like mountain climbing or boot camp. 

But Jesus, some of those war sequences are to die for. They're over the top and obvious but *exciting* as all get out. If Gibson brought the same level of enthusiasm and invention to the interpersonal scenes as he did to the carnage, this film could have been special. 

P.S. Disappointed with the way this film handled the Japanese. Every American soldier got a death that was either incredibly gory to the point that you felt their loss or noble enough to make them feel like heroes, while the Japanese were picked off like flies. I get that they were the enemy but the message of this film is that violence is always bad no matter what direction it goes in. Felt contradictory.",1

Really can't fault the vast majority of their decisions here. The Dreamers storyline was the perfect amount and the changes necessitated by that insertion felt pretty natural.

Then all the additions they made. The big musical numbers were sensational. Holy crap the choreography overall in this movie is out of control good. Having them do a dream ballet for When The Sun Goes Down might be a bit superfluous but the actual choreo and direction is -chef's kiss-. This movie blows La La Land out the water in that regard.

Chris Jackson's cameo is still my favorite part, even after watching it over and over in the trailer. I knew it was unlikely but I was really hoping they'd do the reprise. Oh well. Still 10/10 for me.

Paul is the audience. He's meta, he closes the door, he cares about Smith's kid, and mostly he doesn't treat the situation as seriously as the other characters even though its life or death. 

Hes a pressure release for the audience, so the movie doesn't blow it's INTENSITY load, a la the marvel films, guy ritchie movies, etc. The tone of the scenes Paul are in, are demonstrably different in that they never let the pedal get to the metal so as to let later scenes be that much more impactful.

His jokes and idiocy are used to distract the other characters from the task at hand, and to help them just keep going. He's not just a comedic foil, he's also keeping the crew grounded without asking if they have a dog. 

Losing Paul as an act 1 closer, is used to show that there are no more distractions, you're going to live or die. Just because you're likeable or self-aware doesn't mean shit if you're dead, so KEEP MOVING OH MY GOD.

Maybe it's because the giant skips in time made character development a little tricky, or because I felt like the most dimensional character was Juan, and not Chiron. They gave Chiron a bunch of events to define him, instead of actually building a character behind those events. Essentially, I'm very reactive to films typically, and this movie didn't make me feel as much as I expected. I felt bad for Chiron like I would an injured person on the news.

76056,"I'm not sure, but I think in Japanese mythology there's this weird notion that heavenly people don't have emotions like humans do. In the popular folk story of The Bamboo Cutter it's shown that Princess Kaguya loses her memories/emotions when she returns to the heavens. 

So anyway. Kubo is the child of someone who is from the heavens, who falls in love with a human. This is seen as taboo, and her father is really angry about it. When they have a child, he wants to bring the child back to the heavens, and wants to remove his eyes, which i think is the same as getting rid of his emotions.

His mother runs away with him as a baby, and they live in hiding. It's presumed that his father has been killed by the grandfather. 

Kubo lives in a village and has powers using his instrument, probably because he's got the blood of a heavenly person. 

He gets all sad because his dad's not around, so on the festival for celebrating the dead returning, he stays out past his curfew in the hopes of talking to his dad's spirit. His dad's spirit doesn't appear (because his dad isn't actually dead at this point). 

Because he didn't return to where he and his mother were hiding in time, his mother's sisters find him. They believe the same as his grandfather - in the sense that living in heaven without emotions is better than being on earth. 

Fighting happens and his mother apparently dies fighting her sisters trying to protect him. She tells him that he has to find the special objects from his stories so that he can protect himself from his grandfather. 

He wakes up and there's a monkey protecting him - a monkey that's come out of a wooden charm he's had since he was a child. 

He goes on an adventure with the monkey and he uses his powers of origami ect. Along the way he meets a beetle man who shares the same symbol as Kubo has on his shirt, and the beetle man says he used to work for his dad. He joins the team.

They adventure and find the various items they need. The sisters continue to hunt them down. There's a lot of fighting. 

In the end he is tricked by his Grandfather in a dream, and it looks like all hope is lost. The monkey has received a wound and slowly dying. 

At some point it's revealed that the monkey is in fact his mum, using the final bits of magic she has. The beetleman is his father, who wasn't killed but instead cursed by his Grandfather.

Both die in the end fighting/protecting Kubo. 

Kubo uses his magic/love/whatever to defeat is grandfather, but instead of killing him he sort of makes him mortal. His grandfather loses his memories and Kubo and the village people convince him that he was a really nice guy that loves people and cares for them. I guess he feels emotions now? 

His parents are both dead now, but hey, they visit him at the lantern festival thing sort of.

The ""novel narrative"" was far more interesting than the ""main narrative"" which either ended up being annoying or just plain stupid. The acting for the most part was stale and the dialogue was mostly just clumsy. The only exceptions to those two come in the ""novel narrative"" which has some excellent performances by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon. 

Ultimately, it felt pretentious, clunky, badly paced, horribly edited and it really lacked in tone. I feel and sound like a douche, and a cinema snob (like the character) but I actually found myself sniggering and chuckling at the movie's dumbest or worst moments. For example, the jump-scare scene where Amy Adams is watching the baby monitor and Aaron Taylor-Johnson appears was a genuine eye-roller for me. Again, I hate to be like that, but if a film is going out of its own way to prove to me it's smart, cool or original and then it farts out something like that, I'm going to mock it.",0

14871,"I saw this a couple weeks ago so glad to finally see a discussion for it.

Of all of the Oscar nominees I've seen so far (which is all of them except Mank at this point), I think *The Father* has stuck with me the most, even if it wasn't my out-and-out favourite. The film is just incredible; it is not often I'm moved to full-on tears by a piece of media but dammit, it happened twice here.

Much is being made of Hopkins' performance, and for good reason - it is a towering achievement. I absolutely loved Ahmed in Sound of Metal and would be chuffed to pieces if he won, but Best Lead is 100% going to either Hopkins or Boseman. I'd be happy with either, personally.

However, the structure of the film is probably the aspect which impressed me the most - it truly is like almost nothing I've ever seen before. As someone elsewhere in the thread said, *The Father* stands out because of the way in which it deals with mental illness - we're not on the outside looking in, as is usually the case, but rather right there inside Anthony's head and experiencing everything as he perceives it. It is genuinely terrifying and the use of multiple actors to portray the same characters, heightening the disorientation, is an inspired touch. I have heard this film being called a horror movie and honestly, I can't disagree.

Back to Hopkins though, my god. Understated one moment then brimming with ferocity and outrage the next, this is yet another reminder of why he is one of the all-time greats. There will be some who dismiss his performance as showy Oscar-bait, but that would be doing a massive disservice to his work here. He is the anchor of the piece, the reason the entire film works as well as it does. His vulnerability and pathos are why this is ultimately such an emotionally affecting story, and why the ending is so utterly devastating. In a lesser performer's hands *The Father* could easily have been an overwrought, overly-saccharine drama with no punch at all; as it is, it is one of the best films I will never watch again.",1

68933,"I thought the acting was good in this film and I understand that the it is supposed to be realistic to what life would be like for someone like Lee who lost his kids in a fire he caused plus his dad and then his brother. But God was this moving boring. 
   Lee is literally the exact same person at the start of the movie as he is at the end. He starts out as a lonely janitor in Boston who gets into drunken bar fights. He ends the movie returning to Boston as a lonely janitor who gets into drunken bar fights. Lee starts the movie not wanting to live with his nephew and trying to dump him off on his family friends. The movie ends with him not wanting to live with his nephew and dumping him off on his family friends. His ex wife attempts to reconnect with him and he refuses. 
    I totally get that in real life, that's how a person would act but that doesn't mean I want to watch it for 2 hours.
      There's a scene in Adaptation where Charlie Kaufman (played by nick cage)  goes to a screen writing seminar. During the q&a he tells the speaker (played by Brian cox) he is trying to make a movie more real to life where the characters don't change, they don't have any epiphany's, more resembling real life. Brian Cox goes off on him that he will bore his audience to death, that the characters must evolve and that his final act must wow them in the end. 
     I immediately thought of this scene at the end of Manchester. The characters are all the same at the end as they were at the beginning and then it just ended. I don't get what people liked about this besides the acting.  
    I think this would be better as a TV series that follows Lee over several seasons so maybe we could see some evolution to his character but not rush it unrealistically in a 2 hour movie. Either way, this one was not for me ",1

You almost want to deny it as a “one off”. That scene brought tears to my eyes.

One thing I am curious about: I always thought those who are 100% deaf have distorted speech because they can’t hear themselves talk. Am I wrong in that? I figured Ruben and/or the others at the ranch would follow this speech pattern but they didn’t. Not knocking the film but I expected their speech attempts (if any) to be different.

Anyway, Ahmed is an excellent and very intuitive actor...perfect for this role. I thought the actor who portrayed Joe, the head of the camp, was very moving and I’m not surprised to hear (again, no pun intended) that he comes from a deaf family. I was also not aware that the deaf community views those who get cochlear implants with some disdain. I didn’t know that was a thing. That option was presented to me when I first exhibited my own hearing loss but fortunately, it hasn’t gotten to that level yet.

TL;DR: as someone who is also hearing impaired, this film had a big impact on me. I also appreciate the fact that the film touched on other issues like addiction and wasn’t simply about hearing loss to the exclusion of all else.",1

9462,"> Why were the ghosts so menacing when really they were asking for help and why did it take to the very end for them to finally get the message across as their bones were burning up?

Because they were, in the eyes of the movie ultimately, more perpetrators than victims. I’m no expert on sex work, but there is definitely a certain power imbalance implied by hiring a prostitute through a pimp in the ‘60s that wouldn’t be intrinsically there in other situations.

So were they asking for help, or were they trying to use another young women to undo some kind of justice?

It’s only been a few hours, but I admire the film more than when I was watching it. One central theme was the use and abuse of women, and it bothered me while watching that they’d undercut this theme by having a woman be the villain (she’s quite the serial killer). When I was watching it it seemed like the message was “beware the women who overreact to things,” but I think the visceral horror of the endless parade of men with the constantly flickering features, and that horrible feeling of being trapped makes it fairly clear that what Sandy became what she did as a *reasonable* reaction to what was done to her.",0

By the time of the Liston fight, *Sam had already recorded ""A Change is Gonna Come""* but it wouldn't be released for another few days. So, in the reality of the play/movie, Sam knew that Malcolm was about to get what he wanted from him, but didn't even mention it.

75827,"Ohhhh boy this is not going to make me popular but I had major issues with the emotional beats in the story. I saw it on a whim tonight after seeing the good reviews.

{Spoilers}

First off, none of this criticism reflects the visuals or sound/music work. They were fucking incredible and I recommend the movie on them alone. This was just a beautiful, beautiful movie. 

The story though fails at crucial junctures, which is shocking for a movie about storytellers. Kubo is clearly playing to classic hero's journey archetypes but fails to either fulfill the narrative or reject it (it just sort of... happens). In short, Kubo gets a call of adventure, finds two mentors (who happen to be his parents in disguise), loses them, and... tries to fight a dragon/fish/moon thing? Uh.. here is how it should have happened.

So the movie is great until his mother sacrifices herself 15 or so minutes in, ignites his magic robe, and he flees to safety. Wakes up to Monkey. Finds out she is his guardian and he must find the magic armor of his father to protect himself from the Moon King. Good so far.

Except, in the hero's journey, Kubo has to REJECT the call to adventure. And it makes perfect sense why. He just lost his mom! Like, the one person he cared and loved in the entire world. He has to actually miss her (which he never actually does in the movie bizarrely) which will make Monkey's later reveal that much more meaningful. 

Ok so Kubo rejects the call, something attacks them, action sequence, he uses his power of his strings to fight it off and finds a clue about his father. This ties it back into the themes of parents in the movie and gives an emotional connection back to the film - his mother may be gone but his father might still be alive! The little origami Hanzo guy arrives and we're back on track. 

Movie back on same track. Meet Beetle, playful Beetle to Monkey banter, fight skeleton, pull out sword. Good. Go out to the lake. Bonding moment with all three eating fish (which was good in film as is). They see underwater armor. Beetle goes in. Does NOT get confused (which was stupid) but gets hypnotized. Kubo goes in to save him, Monkey fights her sister, same same, Kubo gets the armor on and Beetle wakes up and saves him. Monkey kills sister but is badly injured. Kubo DOES NOT realize she is his mother (too early). Instead, when hypnotized, he has a vision sent by the Moon King to to his father's castle where his father is waiting. 

The three continue on, have the discussion about the golden condors (another beautiful sequence as is), with the dying Monkey being very wistful. They reach the ruined castle, and it's a trap! Second sister arrives, gives Monkey a fatal wound, then SHE reveals BOTH PARENTS at once. Bam, you have a double impact. The family he thought was lost and was searching for was with him all along. Beetle, knowing he is Hanzo and wanting to protect his son, sacrifices himself to kill the second sister. Both give their tearful goodbye, and die. Kubo is alone.

**This is the key to the entire film. Kubo has to feel those loses once and for all. He had already started to accept them, given in to hope at least his father still lived, then lost them for good just as they were found. He has lost everything, and is vulnerable to the Moon King's temptations now.**

This is important. In the movie as is he is never really tempted by his grandfather (which misses the entire internal arc of the character!) and never shows any real pain or lose for his parents, even temporarily. If he feels that pain it makes more sense for him to see the location of the helmet back in his old village as the hell and want to finish the mission for them. 

He returns to the village, dons the helmet, and his armor set is complete. The Moon King arrives, and sees a silly little boy in a suit of ill fitting armor. He laughs, knocking Kubo around. The armor has no power at all. Everything his parents told him was a lie. Now the Moon King can tempt him fully. Wouldn't it be great to feel no pain? No anguish at death? Feel nothing at all? Give up his other eye and join him in the heavens. Leave the humans to their messy, stupid lives and deaths.

*And Kubo actually considers it. Feeling nothing would be better than the pain in his heart.*

**But then he sees the two strings around his wrist - his mother's hair and father's bow string. And he knows they aren't dead, because nothing ever really dies. It just becomes something else. He learns that crucial lesson from his parents talk about the golden condors.**

Now he is ready to become a hero in his own right. His mother killed one sister. His father the one. He'll have to defeat his grandfather alone. He grabs his instrument, re-strings it with those two strings and his own, and plays. The ancestors from the village return, and push back against the Moon King. His armor lights up. The power was in him all along not in the armor, yada yada. 

The Moon King is worried as he is beaten back by the strings. The Kubo plays one last time, and his parents return at last in their true forms. They defeat the Moon King together. Before they fade they tell him they love him and that he'll grow into the armor soon. Then they fade into the morning light. The end.

Same basic movie structure, just with the character beats in more emotional areas. I'll point out that Pixar/Disney has become a master at figuring out those sort of story beats (which is why their movies are so fucking good lately and tear inducing). Kubo got close, but the script let those amazing visuals down in the end for me. ",0

iirc (it's been like three weeks since I saw the movie so I could be wrong) they said that Cheney never disclosed his financial assets.

They could have easily fixed this by at the dance having them meet behind the bleachers, where we find out their romance started way, way before, but this night now was the first time they were actually caught.

&#x200B;

Pros:

Momoa is a cool Aquaman, not wimpy.

Blank Manta was cool and well done, but I don't think he should've had to make his entire suit over again.

The above ocean scenes were well done, I think Morrison did a great job as his dad.

Ocean Master looked cool at the very end, but without his mask, I wanted to punch his face the entire time.

&#x200B;

Cons:

Underwater stuff will never look good with CGI, just hard to be believable.

Dafoe's man bun (it just looked so weird)

The music mixing I thought was horrible, specifically when Pitbull's cover of Africa came on. But I felt some scenes had like 3 different soundtracks going from happy to sad to intense, during the same conversation, within like a minute.

A lot of it felt like I was watching a movie from the early 2000s.

Everything just went too well with very little consequence or struggle. It was like here's a challenge...done. No real work put in.

&#x200B;

I think Aquaman 2 would be a hard sell. He's kind of a mix between Black Panther and Thor as far as a tech advanced secret society and kind of like a god, ecxcept he grew up with our customs, so Mera had to be the...fish out of water. (pun intended)

Would I know her, is she an actress too?” “Emily Blunt.” “You? *You?” Arrested Development style. “Emily Blunt married *you*?”, more incredulous statement than question.

3) Don’t tell her about it

Turns out, she really wanted to read the script, loved it, recommended John to recommend that part to one of their friends...until it ate at her that she really wanted the part. And of course, he gave his wife the part.

I thought I would really enjoy the movie but I spent 2 hours saying ""wait what?"" constantly.I'm not trying to create drama or anything but I find the movie really bad.

I'm going to glance past the obvious plot armor that makes a 16yo girl invicible.

The plot is just .. dumb.Mother leaves kid out of nowhere, kid goes to find her. She find out her mother literally plans to blow up the house of lords because she wants votes for women. Ok cool, anyways, let's go help this random ass kid I found on the train.

Enola is going to solve the kid's case, because her mother one time told her that sometimes she doesn't need to save people, and let nature run it's course. So she decides to ignore that and become her own person I guess?

How exactly did she solved the case? Because she didn't.  She brought the dude to his big ass mansion to tell the family, but somehow in a house with literally hundreds of servants (as show in a photo), nobody heard shots. Also she thought the uncle was the killer, but it was actually the grandmother so she messed up, and also got the guy killed (saved by plot/metal armor).

And for the biggest ""wait wat"", the kid GOES TO VOTE IN THE SAME BUILDING ENOLA KNEW HER MOTHER WAS PLANNING TO BLOW UP THE WHOLE MOVIE.

I don't know man, the plot is just weird.I feel like the movie got good reviews because it talks about feminism, and they coulnd't afford to say anything bad in fear of not getting slapped by ""ok so you hate women"".  


Edit: Also forgot about another nonsense. Sherlock was proud that his sister beat him to the case.. What case?   
\-Finding the missing mother, which no one of them solved?   
\-The politics plot, which Sherlock said he doesn't want to get involved?  
\-Finding Enola? which, sure, he coulnd't beat Enola at finding Enola ..

Absolutely beautiful. That's all I can really say.

Guillermo del Toro really achieved something special here. You can tell how much love was put into this.

Kind of felt like an R rated disney movie.

Truly though it's a love story that pays homage to the horror movies of the past. Sally Hawkins was incredible, the whole supporting cast was great really, but Sally stole the show. You really believed she loved the fish monster. This is her story most of all it feels like, more than the monsters. I only wish we could spend a bit more time getting to know the monster a bit, and feeling that love he felt for her, as much as we feel the love she has for it.

Still. An amazing movie. Do yourself a favour and see this in theatres if you can. Unbelieveable.",1

39296,"Very wholesome and cute movie. Nothing wrong with some feel good flicks every once in a while.

Apparently Shirley's oldest living family members are not happy with it, and claim that it is ""full of lies.""

If you can understand the fact that it's a hollywood film and not a documentary, *and* be able to overlook the somewhat present white savior tones, it's a very enjoyable flick. 

Ali and Mortensen have incredible chemistry and both give great performances. I loathed the trailer for this movie, I thought it made it look incredibly cheesy. However the film seems to know exactly what it is and it accomplishes what it sets out to do very well. You know when the music is going to swell and the heart strings are going to be pulled, but it still gets you anyways. 

It's less of a commentary film and more of a buddy film. If you go into this expecting some heavy handed intriguing social commentary you'll be disappointed. This film doesn't have anything new to say in that department. Although it does bring up the nat king cole incident very briefly and somewhat touches on ""sundown towns,"" something I'd like to see taught about more. 

I get why black people might not like it, I get why Shirley's family didn't like it, but at the end of the day it still puts a spotlight on the overlooked brilliance and art of Shirley, and somewhat gives a voice to blacks who don't feel ""black enough"" or ""white enough.""",1

I’ve seen comments that the movie is sexist against men but I disagree. I think the movie handled that part better than most “girl power” movies tbh. Both men and women were good and bad in the movie, as it is in real life. Lesser movies would have taken the easier route where all women are good and all men are bad. Although, I did not like that Mycroft was portrayed as a snob and an overall bad guy. As for Henry Cavill’s Sherlock, I think they took a page out of Jonny Lee Miller’s version rather than Benedict’s. Not that I’m complaining, I loved *Elementary*. 

What I appreciated most about it was that she was actually taught to fight by her mother, unlike in other movies where women are portrayed to be able to do anything just because they’re women **coughs** Mulan (2020) **coughs**. I think *Enola Holmes’* approach is more inspiring since you need to actually train and make an effort to do great things.

Jim Carrey was great and all, but that movie has so much unnecessary stuff added to it. This movie has padding to, but it was all connected to The Grinch’s scheme. Him wanting to steal Christmas didn’t just come in at the last minute. 

I also enjoyed the Cindy Lou subplot. Again, it was better than the live action one and actually adapted what Seuss wrote. This time, the who’s actually knew what Christmas was about instead of competing against each other and getting pissy when Christmas was stolen.

The Grinch being more human and relatable might annoy some people, but I had fun with it. The theme song doesn’t match him at all, but other than that nitpick, it was nice to see a version of the character that keeps the concept, but makes it different instead of copy-pasting the past three adaptations. (His relationship with Max was pretty cute to. There’s no reason for him to be treated like crap) The scene with his heart growing looked beautiful, and the fleshed out ending was nice. (Also, thank you writers for not setting him up with Cindy’s mother)

All in all, good movie. I wonder what Warner Bros is gonna do with The Cat In The Hat.

Yet early on I still had a very different prediction of what was going to happen with the Ernesto reveal. I thought we were going to see an empty shell of a person who was just a depiction of his movie scene so with no personality. Which would somehow reveal to Miguel that Hector was his real father prompting a new mad dash to find him. The idea would be to underline that it wasn't just important to be remembered in the afterlife but also how you were rememebered, and since no one knew Ernesto as anything except his performances that was all he was in the afterworld. Which would also more directly push a family over fame narrative, instead of just a family is important, and fame is important, just don't kill your friends narrative.

it seems like phil is basically emulating henry in every way since he worships him so much. with the way the other cowhands seem to worship phil so much, i wonder if he has already tried something with some of the cowhands.

another callback in the beginning is when george asks phil if phil will ever use the bath in the house, meaning phil never does. i wonder if the river bath was an early morning ritual between phil and henry.",1

32001,"Don't know if this comment by u/Saintbaba is what you meant but it's always stuck with me(on mobile, don't know how to link so I'll just c&p).

The Toy Story trilogy is one of the greatest examinations of personal loss of our generation. Each one answers a question that the last one asked.

In Toy Story, the movie concerns Woody's jealousy about Buzz stealing his place in Andy's life, and basically asks, how do i stop someone from falling out of love with me? But then it shies away from answering that question. It sort of drops it in favor of Woody and Buzz coming together.

In Toy Story 2, the movie returns to that question, and answers very simply that you can't. You can't stop someone from falling out of love with you. And so you have to enjoy the time you have with them - you need to make every moment precious. You love well while you have the chance, and risk that pain, because it's infinitely better than locking your heart away, shielding it in a glass case where it can be safe and sterile and untouchable forever.

Toy Story 3 then answers the question that Toy Story 2 didn't even know it was asking - alright then, i let them go. And what do i do after that? And Toy Story 3 says: you live your life. You don't forever after walk backwards through life looking back at that relationship. You don't let it consume you. When you let them go, you let them go. You remember the good times, and maybe you remember the bad times too. And then you find new people to love, and that's okay. That's good. That's necessary - the only thing you can do if you don't want to become bitter and regretful and hateful and tied to the front of a garbage truck.",0

Guillermo’s was more of a portrayal of what humanity can be at it’s absolute worst. Like the monsters that are usually the villains of his film got to be the focus, whereas Rooney Mara’s character would typically be the protagonist of his.

The idea of being loved and being part of a family was too much for her to bear. Same when she was at her sister’s home. Grief can have such an impact and sometimes it leaves you afraid of accepting love again for fear you’ll have to bear another heartbreaking loss.

Was Phil the villian? I think he saw this gay kid and knew he would have to play the role of a straight man to survive in this world, so he was trying to teach him how to pretend the same way he has had to for years. But this kid was not going to live in the same world that Phil has.

Who would have been a better longterm mentor Phil or Rose? His protection and love for Rose seems toxic.

Did Peter purposely put himself in a position to be mocked by the other cowboys knowing Phil would see himself in the kid and would come to rescue him. And in turn allow him to get close enough to kill him?

Would the kid had actually gone through with the murder if Phil had not gone apeshit over the rawhide? He seemed conflicted.

There are multiple kinds of harm. Not all of them are physical.

What's harmful is that microaggressions are societies way of telling a person that they don't belong. That a girl doesn't belong in a computer science class. That a black man isn't welcome in a company meeting. No one may have done anything overt or outright racist or sexist. But a hundred different ""minor"" interactions all add up to say ""you're not welcome here"" or ""we accept you - as an exception to the norm, because people like you? Don't usually belong here"".

But Jesus Christ, this movie. It does thing so well. It's shot interestingly (the beginning car chase really stands out to me), it's edited together actually coherently, the effects are just beyond great, and more importantly...the characters are amazing. 

I have a brother on the spectrum so when I heard someone was on it, I hoped they did it justice and didn't hamfist it. I loved how it, along with Trini's lesbianism, aren't *the main aspects* of their characters. That really shines when they're around the campfire and sharing secrets. We expect Billy to say that since he only ever told Jason at the start...but nope. And when Trini says it, it's not forced and she goes out of her way to say she hates the labels her parents give 'em and actively avoids them. 

It weaved cheese-factor and realism together in a way I didn't think possible. Rita bitch slapped into space, literally crying when Billy dies because we all expected him to come back on the docks right?, and the actual theme song playing when they're in the zords after they have the most feel-good-we're-a-team-moment ever.

I worry people went in expecting an hour and a half of a power rangers TV show, that would get old for me. Nope, we got a full movie with characters I actually care about and related to. We've all been Jason Scott, screwed up big time and have to face our parents. We've all been Billy, a little eccentric and picked on. We've all been Trini, trying to find ourselves. We've all been Zack, doing what we think is right even if it doesn't really benefit us immediately. And we've all been Kimberly, done shitty, mean things and had to live with it but come to accept we're not shitty people.

I'm actually blown away by how good this fucking movie is. Maybe it's my inner-child, maybe it's me tired of the dark and real movies, or how formulaic super hero movies are, or maybe it was my amazing theater packed with kids, teens, college kids, and adults alike.

However my guess is that the movie followed the actions of the pilot during Dunkirk true to its word but made up a couple of stuff for entertainment purposes.

For example, there was no way a Supermarine Spitfire (with the Merlin Engine) could maintain a glide for that long (and at that speed) and shoot down a diving aircraft without wasting too much speed and altitude. (Also remember the recoil from the guns slow down the aircraft as they fire)

In reality it all probably happened extremely quickly that the pilot didn't have time to land on the beach or in the water near their troops and instead had to find a better landing spot that was close enough to glide too.

Season 6 was filmed in 2015 when the actor was only 16/17 compared to 1917 when he would have been 21/22 during filming. That can make a big difference for someone so young.

It takes the mystery out of knowing, but if executed well, I thought it would have added a whole other element and feeling to the film.

I was dreading the climax because of what I thought it would depict—the horrific, senseless murder of a sweet, innocent pregnant woman and her friends. Showing her graphic murder in film would have been like killing her again, revictimizing her in grisly torture porn-like fashion. 

Instead of inflating the glory of some cowardly murderers, Tarantino chose to show just how pathetic they were. He refused to gratify the people out there who still idolize the Manson family. We get to see what should have happened, and as the movie ends, Sharon Tate is happily inviting her friends and neighbor into her home.

She may not have had that chance in real life, but at least we got to see her happy ending in a big, star-studded movie. I left the theater with a feeling of lightness mixed with melancholy. It was a bittersweet fairy tale. 

I also appreciated that neither Charles Manson nor Roman Polanski got much screen time or focus. 

Finally, the young girl who played Leo’s costar on set was awesome. She was the highlight of the first half of the movie for me.

I thought the trailers gave out most of the punchlines, which weren't very funny after the first time - if at all. They also, unfortunately, gave out a lot of the scenes where we would feel compelled to care but don't end up caring at all (or even as much as we should) because we saw it in the trailers anyway. The last half hour or so was better than the beginning, in my opinion, with a nice range of music in different genres that I enjoyed listening to. Because of the widespread amount of stakes with the varying characters, I felt like nothing was really at stake, especially since a lot of the problems ""resolved"" themselves. I saw resolved in quotes because I don't feel they really did resolve the characters' issues. I did end up enjoying it more than I thought. 

MINOR SPOILERS: Lastly, damn! Buster's happy cheery face as he stole water and power from the city cracked me up. Especially in the beginning where he nearly injured countless people with his bike riding! ",0
68806,"Its weird how this was one of the funniest films I've seen all year.

63646,"I left the theater Saturday heartbroken after having been extremely excited beforehand to see this film. I get it that Rian Johnson was trying to take the franchise in a new direction, but for me who was more or less happy with the Star Wars universe pre-TLJ, this movie felt like a slap in the face. While I have many issues with the film, there are two I want to highlight.

First, the humor was excessive and over-the-top. It felt out of place and offputting and never allowed me to settle into the film. There were a multitiude of moments where I felt I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy or some other MCU movie. Like clockwork, I could expect a joke to come on screen every 2-3 minutes. I understand that Star Wars can be goofy at times and that the OT had its fair share of silly humor, but TLJ takes it to an extreme level. In this regard, the opening scene has me wondering why Hux is even a character. I think TFA had the perfect balance of comedy and wish this film had followed its lead.

Second, the direction that they take Luke in feels like a betrayal of his character. RoTJ ends with Luke saving his father after having always believed he could be redeemed. TLJ expects me to believe that Luke was willing to kill his own nephew (even if only for a second) after having only felt Kylo harbor dark side inclinations in his dreams. Seriously? Additionally, this happened when Kylo was still a kid under Luke's tutelage and before he had even done anything evil. It's completely out of place with everything we've come to know about who Luke Skywalker is.

There's more (the useless side-plot with Finn and Rose, the complete disregard for any of the questions and mysteries that TFA set up, the fact that in under a week Rey has somehow managed to become the most powerful Jedi in existence), but I'll leave it at that. It kills me that I no longer care about these characters or have a desire to know what happens next. For those who liked the film, I'm really, genuinely glad you did. I'm actually quite jealous.

They're interrupted at the 4th minute mark, so Harlan probably killed himself at the 6th minute mark, right around the time the first effects started showing up. 

One could argue he should have realized something was up when he didn't feel anything, but there are also explanations for that: he might have actually started to feel something with the combination of stress, psychosomatic effect, and maybe some morphine left inside the bottle and mixed with his medicine. So he has no reason to doubt he is ODing. On the other hand, Marta was a mess and wasn't thinking straight, when Harlan started to boss her around she stopped questioning things.

Also, Harlan admits he's forgetting something in his master plan: the toxicology report, which a mystery novelist like him should have thought about and which made his scheme pointless.

The only issue here is with Fran: Why was she still alive and conscious when Marta found her 2 hours after Ransom drugged her with a shitload of morphine too?",0

So during the film my thoughts varied as each layer of the story unfolded.  When they introduced the female twins and pointed out the similarities for both groups I felt comforted - in that I was always going to be this way and I have no control over it and it's okay. Then they went on to focus on Eddy and the differences between the triplets and I went back to thinking ""well, maybe I would have a different outcome if so and so hadn't happened during my early development and adolescent"".

16108,"I could not disagree more. First, Fincher has stated in interviews that Fincher himself and Roth did rewrites to Fincher’s father, Jack’s, original script because it was too much of an attribution battle and Fincher said he was not interested in a two hour attribution battle. So, I don’t see a reason why he would lie while promoting his movie but if he is lying and he “trojan horsed” it in there at the end as you claim then it’s a truly, poorly constructed story of an attribution battle and considering one of Fincher’s masterpieces, The Social Network, has at its core, a battle over an idea we know he could make that type of story riveting. So either one of the most exacting, fastidious filmmakers we have is lying to the media and suddenly forgot how to construct a story or Mank isn’t actually a story of an attribution battle, which leads me to my next point...

Fincher himself benefits from being regarded as an auteur, a master of his craft, obsessively involved in nearly every detail of his films. A reputation he shares with Welles, so I find this idea that Fincher woke up one day and decided to attempt to ruin the reputation of Orson Welles completely ridiculous. 

I maintain, even if this movie is secretly about authorship, Welles is the natural antagonist for that story and his character is barely in the movie, he may have less screen time than the Frieda character. 

>	The whole idea of “Mank’s talent was being mined by others” is literally the Kael theory just replacing Welles with Meyer/Hearst

What I meant by his talent being mined is his renown wit, fierce social criticism, and his insight by the power brokers around him. In the scene with Irving Thalberg, Mank astutely disparages the execs for being able to produce movies that suspend the audience’s disbelief but somehow cannot smear a political opponent. Mank’s casual insult sparks the idea for the use of propaganda films against Sinclair which sets the path to his friend’s suicide. Hence Mank’s guilt, which I referred to. And as for Hearst, he makes it quite clear to Mank that Mank is the monkey in the parable and he’s only inviting him to those dinner parties because he thinks Mank is funny and likes the way he talks. Not of that has anything to do with Kael’s theory or Mank’s stories being stolen.

Honestly, watch the movie again with the themes of guilt, moral responsibility, and power in your head and see how you interpret it after a second viewing. Unless you’re a giant fan of Louis Mayer, I don’t see how you could be upset at the “villains” of this story. It is quite clearly a takedown of Hollywood power brokers and the studio system of old Hollywood being a strong obstacle to creative expression. I mean, that’s another thing Fincher and Welles have in common, they both fought for creative control over their early projects. If anything, this movie is proposing it’s a miracle Citizen Kane got made at all given the pressures against it. 

Rather than Fincher lazily shoehorning in a controversial theory at the end of his movie it’s much more likely he gave the “authorship debate” the proportion it deserved which is to say a petty squabble that amounts to a couple of minutes of screen time before they share the Oscar victory as they did in real life.",1

I can buy that Maria fell in love with Tony at first sight; I can’t buy that she would be in the mood to have sex with him merely moments after learning of her brother’s death, or that Tony would get over the fact he’d just committed homicide (which is his entire emotional arc throughout the film) immediately after.

I never understood how Bohemian Raphsody became an Oscar contender, and after seeing Rocketman, it's become even more nonsensical to me.

Seriously, this movie doesn't just trade on nostalgia to get people to think they like it. It's actually interested in the performer's life and work beyond the superficial, and finds ways to use their music to tell the story. Yeah, it's not 100% accurate or anything like that, but it let's you know right away that it isn't going to be by quickly displaying it's stylized version of events right at the beginning, as opposed to Bohemian Raphsody trying to pass itself off as a genuine retelling despite whitewashing things or outright fabricating them.

I believe it had been mentioned earlier on that the core meltdown was a possibility due to the earthquake, so she probably just took advantage of the damage to the system. All she did was crank up the power, after all.",0
54848,"Is there anyone else who thought the movie lost steam once they got married? I'm not sure at exactly what timestamp that is in the film, but for the first hour or more, I was completely enthralled. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It was almost like some sort of suspense/thriller, despite it just being a romantic drama. I didn't want it to end. If the rest of the film was like what I was witnessing, I knew I'd be disappointed with the (for PTA) short runtime. 

Once they got married, though, it lost my attention. I no longer cared about their relationship or what might happen to it. I had no idea what was going to happen next, and unlike in the first half, that was a bad thing. Any film that doesn't have me checking my watch (and there have been a lot of those recently- this has been a great year for movies) is considered well done, in my opinion. But after the marriage, I considered consulting my watch.

PTA fanboy. You couldn't find someone who appreciates PTA and his films more than I do. I think Inherent Vice is the best film he's made, and I made that decision after viewing it for the sixth time. Have the poster hung in my basement. I could watch all of his films on a loop for days. A lot of them are long, and I want them to be longer, so I can spend more time with the characters. So I went into this film expecting a similar rollercoaster ride. I was let down. Maybe it was just my expectations. Everything was beautiful, performances were great, it gripped me for a substantial portion of the film, one of Greenwood's best scores. Everything about it was 100% PTA at his finest. Until they got married. My attention started wandering, and it didn't pick up again until the last fifteen minutes or so. As a result, the impact of the ending was lost on me. By all accounts, it should have been a sucker punch to the gut, but it just wasn't. If the film had maintained the momentum throughout, it would have been. Instead, the ending just seemed aloof to me.

Anyone else have this issue? Maybe on future viewings (and there will be PLENTY), I'll change my mind. But did anyone else's mind start wandering a little after the hour mark?",1

Even though this movie was so rich as far as the locations, food, and clothing there were parallels there between Plainview and Woodcock(to a lesser extent Lancaster Dodd since PTA had parts in the master where that character was show to be full of shit). Men so consumed with their desires to create something and their abilities to bend others to that intense will. With Plainview he had sort of a hard rival in Paul Dano's preacher and in this sort of a soft rival in Alma but still equally as fierce. In both characters it seems everything around them is so deliberate and measured and they see the people around them as tools(HW Plainview/Alma/Cyril).

Enjoyed the soundtrack of course. The references were on point from pop culture. CGI was not at any point piss poor because it’s a game and it’s chill if it looks like a game, but even then nothing fell short!

**Now I should preface this with a PSA: 90% of the time someone sees a movie in theaters they don't like it, then they see it again a year later on Netflix and start to like it and appreciate [source: my rectum and personal observations]. I think this is because not enough people actually go to a movie theatre *by themselves,* so when they leave they don't get a chance to sit with it before their friend starts talking about it.**

Okay, now with that said, I saw it by myself and gave my brain to the director. I probably like it because I related to it so well. The scene where the mother is silently washing the dishes while Lady Bird is screaming for her attention almost had me in tears, it brought back a lot of frustration and helpless desperation that I personally experienced as a teen, but I think for a broader audience it really exemplifies the point that mother thinks she knows what's ""best"" but in reality it's demoralizing and traumatizing for your child who really is still dependent on you despite trying to become their own person.

The things she went through with school and boyfriends and the popular crowd, all yes and yes and yes. She's experimenting with so many different identities. The depressed father who shows this heart-warming unconditional support and love for his daughter without ever seeing the personal toll it takes on him shows how the father, a soft-spoken character who bends to his wife, followed the ""right"" path in life and it gave him a humble yet depressing life. And then when Lady Bird tells the guy at the end she's from San Francisco because he doesn't know where Sacramento is, I think that was fucking brilliant because it reveals that her old identity is an ambiguous blur of the past to other people in her new city (and as someone who has lived in 5 different cities in the last 5 years, I can tell you I do that all the time). 

What was most beautiful about the film though was at the end, when shots of Lady Bird and her mom flash between each other as they do the same drive in their home town, and it really comes through that her psycho mom was like her once, struggling to find her identity, and just did what she did out of love because she didn't want her daughter to end up having the same life she did. 

I walked out of that fucking theatre with goosebumps. It just perfectly captured the REAL transition from child to adulthood.

14068,"I loved his performance at the end too and it's one of those haunting images that will stay with me. Seems like it's truer to the original source material than the 1947 adaptation (in which he gets back with Molly).

In the summary to the 1946 novel, the ending plays exactly the same as the movie:

>His life in shambles, Stan finds a carnival owner and asks to join the sideshow as a palm reader. The owner gives Stan some whiskey but refuses his proposal, saying the show is full. But as Stan begins to drunkenly stumble out, the owner changes his tune and invites Stan back in with a job offer: ""Of course, it's only temporary – just until we get a real geek.""",1

17114,"Alison Brie's character is, thru my eyes as a woman, very culpable in a way that can't be compared to Ryan's. Her culpability speaks to the way women make excuses for men, turn their backs on victims and choose to throw their weight behind a narrative in which girls who get raped make themselves vulnerable (by the way they dress or consume alcohol, etc) which allows characters like AB's to *not* have to face hard truths about the men in their lives.

I kind of took each ""relationship"" between Cassie and the guilty parties to represent microcosms of similarly problematic relationships between victims/survivors and society.
Victim vs. The Perpetrator (Cassie v. Al), Victim vs. Institutions (Cassie v. The Dean), victims vs. those in the victim's very own demographic (Cassie v. Alison Brie), victim vs. those who have suffered the exact same trauma (Cassie v. Nina's mom), victim vs. the patriarchy (Cassie v. Ryan). And, of course victim vs. Self (Cassie who needs to avenge/honour/stay loyal to Nina vs. Cassie who deserves to heal from this trauma and find happiness and healing.) 

Cassie vs the judicial system lost its teeth because the lawyer was ready to fall on his sword and admit culpability - perhaps the movie's message to the legal system is to make some mea culpas and find ways to do right by victims - no further damage is done when that happens.

Such an interesting movie with a lot to say.",1

Look into the long and ugly history of eugenics if you're still not understanding how bad your comment is.

69063,"One more glaring plot development that stood out to me was how Randi was able to move on (materially, if not emotionally) from the tragedy and how Lee was basically still in the purgatory he had put himself in. I know for Lee the tragedy cut deep for him as he had placed the blame on himself for it, in a way ""failing"" in his role as a responsible adult and his role as a man and father as protector of his children. Consequently, you could read the situation as Randi being he victim of the tragedy and Lee being the cause (and also victim). Judging from the reception from some of the locals they might well share that view.

But for me it still highlights the discrepancy between how male and female vulnerability are received in broader society. How did Randi end up with a new partner, new household to settle down in and a newborn child? She couldn't have done so without revealing some if not all of the details of her previous life, and subsequently receiving all the sympathy and support she clearly deserves from family members, wider society and of course her new partner. Why has Lee not been able to build a new life in similar fashion? 

He hasn't received the same support, whether he has refused it or it has not been available. He wears a heavy burden of being a failure as a man, that he places on himself and that society places on him. I even felt Patrick was somewhat unsympathetic to his plight throughout most of the movie, until that poignant moment he stops to look closely at the framed pictures Lee keeps of his children, only then choosing to act in a more thoughtful manner towards him.

I thought the screenwriter was very shrewd in how he only ever showed the male characters breaking down twice, once after Lee has that gut-wrenching encounter with Randi and once after Patrick is told by Lee that he can't stick around to be his guardian. I think by only seeing those emotions truly overcome our male protagonists at these rare moments makes for a more realistic portrayal of male emotional turmoil and more impactful for the viewer.",1

It's most definitely *lucky* that those little karmic moments paid off for her, but that's just standard movie luck that comes with telling stories that should have wrap-around moments like these.

Structurally, the screenplay was fine. It was the very loose narrative and overall arc for characters that was incredibly weak. Oldman mostly just had to bumble onto the set and leave most days, it seems. There are maybe two standout scenes, but other than that, I don't think he deserves a nom. While there are a fair amount of movies with essentially no plot and arcs you have to dig into (Boyhood comes to mind instantly), those movies at least resonate. This movie feels like it alienates.

I actually watched the movie with subtitles on, so I caught all the dialogue. It just seemed very forced and stylized, which is obviously the point, but just didn't seem like a necessary flourish. Like the film's technical aspects, it just didn't seem to all gel together on screen. If the movie was more... zappy (???) then it would've worked. Not like Scott Pilgrim or anything, but just more alive.

So, I'm a teacher, and I've done middle and high.  When Riley got out of the car, my middle-school-girl protective side went straight up.  I was so tense.  When I saw Riley's mannerisms, and how he handled it, out came my high-school teacher side.  It was very bizarre because at first I was so protective and so tense about a violating moment, and then when Riley's also-childish behavior was pretty apparent, I became really empathetic for both of them while understanding that they were both children and all things considered, however uncomfortable, it was a pretty common experience.  Yes, a 16-17 year old propositioning a 13-14 year old is very uncomfortable for our adult eyes.  But it happens all the time, and remembering that the 16-17 year old was \*also\* a child was a very interesting revelation.  I think a lesser film would have gone out of it's way to make Riley seem predatory, whereas this film makes him seem in-the-wrong, sure, but awkward and unsure.",0
18931,"I didn't find the narrative particularly interesting but the performances are absolutely outstanding. It makes sense, I suppose, being based on a play that it's very much a performance heavy film.

I kind of felt that the ending (with Toledo's death) came out of nowhere but I understand the point that the film/play is trying to make. Despite all his talk, Levee is deeply traumatized by what happened to his parents and to him and he is walking around with all this rage and anger trying to turn it into something. He tries at first to channel it into his music and he is talented but he's stymied by the opportunities he can get (also I totally assumed that Mr. Irvin was stealing his songs to give them to another band - I was shocked he even offered to pay for them at the end. After all, why take the songs if you aren't planning to use them?). Some of Levee's problems are of his own making, of course, he's obnoxious, he's rude and he's combative and that certainly doesn't help you get any further in life and he throws away a good opportunity with Ma Rainey's band because he doesn't want to just follow the rules. Anyway in the end, I thought at first that he would stab Mr. Irvin because of Chekov's knife and all but instead he turns that violence onto an innocent person, someone who is just as oppressed as he is, someone who has shown him nothing but kindness for the most part - in part, because he knows from his father's experience, that he could never kill a white man and get away with it (not that Irvin deserved to die for stealing someone's music). It's a very heavy ending. 

I find that this era of American plays tend to deal heavily with the casualties of the American Dream. You're sold a bill of goods but they'll never come through for you and you spend your whole life chasing a phantom.

73070,"I think this was easily the best computer generated film Disney has ever made and is absolutely up there with the Disney greats.

Pros:

One of the undisputable great elements of the film is its animation which is absolutely stunning.  I could make at least 20 different beautiful desktop backgrounds from this film and y'all best know I will.

The characters were all fantastic and the dynamic between Maui and Moana was great with each event pushing their great arcs just a little further. Their dynamic was not only great in dialogue but also in action as in each conflict they go through both characters work off each other and improve in doing so throughout the film. 

The soundtrack was spectacular,  you know I'll be downloading all of these songs. 

One of the things that sets this film apart from other Disney films is its use of  a female protagonist in that in the many recent Disney films which have been all ""Yeah, look how strong I am,  you wouldn't think that of a woman!""  and this has felt really shoehammered into the film. This wasn't the case of Moana as the film didn't make a big deal of how bad ass she was,  it just made her bad ass. Moana and her determination was the driving force of the movie and the whole thing felt very natural as opposed to a ""strong female protagonist""  bouncing around between situations in which they can show those who doubted them how strong they are. 

Cons:
The coconut pirates very much felt like they needed someone to attack the ship and some producer said ""You see those guys who attack the boat. Two words: coconut minions"". The attack itself was very well done but there was little to no reason for the characters actually being coconuts. 

While I absolutely adore Jermaine Clement and loved the crabs song basically just before it was like a bonus flight of the conchordes song (yes please)  it seriously didn't fit in with the rest of the film.  I loved it but the whole thing was like

Moana-Moana-Moana-Flight of the Conchordes-Moana

That said the pros so heavily outweighed the cons it was an absolutely stunning experience and I know I'll gladly watch it again sometime in the near future. ",0

While I don’t think it’s a technical masterpiece of any sort the totality of it as this rough-edged pulpy dark romantic comedy thriller satire is like, pretty damn charming with a real serious beating heart of fucked up reality no one wants to ever talk about but made palatable by candy coated dark comedy.

60692,"Just saw this movie yesterday. I liked this movie a lot. While it wasn’t perfect for a few reasons, I thought it was a great film. However, there was one thing that really bothered me about the movie. I really think they made a big mistake in regard to casting. I'll just come out and say it. Renner's role should have been played by a Native American. And not simply for the sake of the lost opportunity for representation, but more importantly because the narrative suffered a bit because of it.

For example, as presented in the movie, the subplot where [Renner's character and the father of the murdered girl grapple with the loss of their children is extremely powerful. However, if Renner's character was casted as a Native American, the scene would have taken on a more meaningful and darker subtext. Instead of the two men just bonding over the loss of their daughters, it would have been two men, grappling with the reality that their community and culture is deteriorating, with the rape and murder of their child only playing a part of that grim reality. And now picture these two men staring off in the distance while the movie fades to black. ](#spoiler)

Another scene that would have worked so much better was the scene where [Renner scolds the brother in the back of the cop car and lays out the options he eschewed in favor of living his life as a junkie. The scene is played relatively straight with Renner showing a measure of sympathy for the brother. But were the character a Native American, there would be a deeper subtext and a more interesting dynamic between the two characters. From one older cynical Native American to another younger jaded Native American, the conversation becomes much more meaningful, and can go in many different directions.] (#spoiler)

In the film, they had a brief window of opportunity to add depth to the scene, and even add more thematic depth to the plot as a whole, when [the brother calls out Renner's character for coming from outside the community. ] (#spoiler) Unfortunately they chose not to flesh that theme out more, and it remained one of the few, if not the only allusion to the characters’ background.

Every scene I imagine with a Native American Actor is far more powerful in my head. [Even the speech Renner gives at the end to Olsen’s character about surviving](#spoiler), would have taken on a darker subtext. Every time Renner referred to “his family’s struggles” it would remind me of how unnecessary the casting was. Instead of having Renner defer his struggles to “his family’s” struggles, they could simply be his struggles. 

The most frustrating part about the casting decision, is that it felt unnecessary. If they had used Renners’ character to add depth to the role and plot, the movie would have been fine. But as written, the role didn’t lend itself to a non-Native American character, and would have suited a Native American actor more cleanly. It would have been at least a little better, albeit controversial and hard to pass off, to have the character played by Renner be Native American. At times, it can feel that Hollywood has trouble believing that white audience members can empathize with non-white actors. However, it is more likely that there just aren't enough big name Native American Actors they can put on the playbill. It is also possible, they just couldn't find a Native American Actor to audition for the part that was up to snuff. Whatever the case, I feel like they really missed an opportunity to take this movie to the next level simply for the sake of making a few extra dollars in the box office.

Spoilers ahead:

I never read the book, so I have no other context other than the movie, but I think it became clear towards the end that that everything outside of the some of the scenes with the Janitor are the complete fantasy of the Janitor himself, who is in fact Jake at an older age. Apologies if this is obvious to most people.

The Janitor's life is shown in a few quick snapshots. We see that he is aged. We see that he lives alone. We see that he works as a janitor at a High School where the students don't respect him, make fun of him, or are creeped out by him. He is not living a satisfying life, and as his life approaches its end, it becomes clear to him that there is little he can do change things.

Instead of trying to change things, he does what he has probably done for most of his life, which is to use fantasy to try to construct a potentially better life. It is hinted at in dialogue that Jake/the Janitor has probably been lonely and socially awkward for most of their life. His mother says that he never had many friends in childhood or adulthood, and it seems clear that he is not comfortable around people.

This brings us to his fixation on the Young Woman, sometimes called Lucy or Louisa or Lucille. I think that a portion of the story that she tells about their first meeting at the dinner table is accurate. It is likely that Jake did go to a a trivia night and did see the young woman and maybe even exchanged a few words with her. I doubt there was anything beyond this, but it was enough to begin a fixation within Jake. He probably first admonished himself for not asking for her number. This grew into something more and at some point in his life, he began to think of this moment as the last time he could have done something in order to have a happy life. If he had just asked for her number, or if she had asked for his, everything could be different.

Everything we see of the Young Woman and Jake's relationship in the movie is Jake creating elaborate fantasies about how the relationship could have worked out. This accounts the various changes in the Young Woman's character throughout the movie. He always fantasizes that she is intelligent and creative. Sometimes this means that she is a poet, sometimes a painter, sometimes a physicist, but she is always idealized in some way. In a monologue near the end, the Young Woman addresses this. In the fantasy Jake is always smarter than he is, and the Young Woman is always perfect, not necessarily because he wants her to be perfect, but because he wants her to be respected, which in turn would bestow respect on him, something he dearly desires.

It also accounts for the name changes. He never actually got the Young Woman's name so it changes throughout the movie and as his fantasy develops. It also indicates how little Jake actually knows about the woman he has constructed his fantasies around. She is a complete blank slate that any characteristics can be applied to.

I think it's interesting that even deep within Jake's fantasies, the relationship is still imperfect. He imagines fights and even that the Young Woman may not want to be in a relationship with him at all. This is likely the insecurities, depression, and anxiety that have plagued Jake for all of his life coming through in his fantasies. He is a person who feels unworthy of other people's love and affection, and it is likely these feelings that have stunted all of his relationships throughout his life. Even attempting to create a fantasy in which he is happy is difficult for him to do.

Throughout the movie the phrase ""I'm thinking of ending things"" is thought by the Young Woman in reference to their relationship. At the end this takes on a new meaning, of Jake/the Janitor ending their life. I think it is very likely that he does in fact do this at the end of the movie, ending his unhappiness and regrets.

What I'm less certain about is what the overall theme of the movie is. It could be about missed opportunities, but I think that's too simple. There is no indication that had Jake actually asked for the Young Woman's number that his life would have been any different, or that he would have somehow been saved from a life of unhappiness.

I think more generally it is about allowing depression and anxiety to take control of your life, which in turn makes life unfulfilling and full of regret.

This is a deeply sad movie and the Janitor is a truly tragic figure. Unfortunately I think there are far more people like the Janitor than we realize. People who suffer inside of their own heads day in and day out while never letting anybody else in.",0

25002,"I haven't read all 3,000 comments here, but have seen none that explain the long dialogues the way my wife and son and I interpreted them after watching this last night. 

We saw them as iterations of a creative process. Like the janitor or Kaufman himself was trying out versions of dialogues. So what we see are the writer's attempts to find the right tone or make choices about what happens in a scene or interaction. 

""What age should the parents be? Maybe middle aged? No it's better if they are older.""

""The father's bandaid is on the right side of his forehead. No maybe it's on the left side.""

""I like opening with the young woman saying to herself 'I'm thinking of ending things.'. Maybe she's waiting on the sidewalk to be picked up. No maybe they are already in his car on the way to the farm. Maybe the opening line goes like this. No maybe like this...""

The Dirt completely romanticized drugs, alcohol, sex, and partying while glossing over the many negative things that came with Motley Crue.  Rocketman completely did the opposite, showing how these things destroyed Elton John's life.  

The endings were starkly different as well.  The Dirt had Motley Crue voice over and say ""we regret some things we did"" and show they were still all friends.  Rocketman showed how Elton John actually turned his life around.

This seemed a more real story and not just glorification of his rock star life style.",0

It's not perfect, but I'm damn happy with this. Happy that it's a good movie, for Craig's run as Bond to go out with a bang, and to have seen how the Bond movies evolved over the last fifteen years. What an exciting time to be a fan. 

I will say that Malek isn't the most compelling villain. He's a little paint by numbers are far as Bond villains go. His connection to Swan is the most interesting thing about him, but his general motivations, plans, and traits are pretty classic Bond. His role in the movie is perfectly serviceable to get us to what's most impressive about this movie and that's how human and emotional it is. 

Craig Bond has always stood out by being more raw than other Bonds, so this seems a fitting end. His movies also have way more continuity than any other Bond so I'm glad they stuck to that even after the middling critical reception of Spectre. I think Lea Seydoux is probably one of the best Bond actresses and giving her a big role in these last two movies was a big brain move and payed off really well in this movie. 

As far as the action, the lair, the Bondness of it, it's a perfectly good Bond movie. But it's the emotion and acting and finality of it that make it unique and make it stand out from pretty much any other Bond movie. I think it's a great way to wrap up a Bond actor. We are so far past winking at the camera and saying ""the other guy never had to deal with this"" or joking about actor changes. So this felt like the right way. We saw his beginning as a 00, now we get to see the end. 

I think I'd rank Craig's movies with Casino Royale in first place, then this, then Skyfall, SPECTRE, and QoS. And honestly it might be my JB hype at an all time high, but I rewatched them all this week and SPECTRE was definitely better than I remembered. Overall, this was an easy 8/10. It's a bit long and is very reminiscent of classic Bond, but I've never cried so hard in a Bond movie.",0

10679,"Enjoyed this quite a bit. It's colorful, catchy, fairly emotional, and honestly the quality of animation on these things is starting to scare me. 

Wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this movie from the trailer. But there was one thing I was sure of, and that's that the main character would eventually discover her power and it would be the most powerful of all. I was getting Colombian Umbrella Academy vibes. And since I love being surprised, I have to say I was impressed they didn't go that route.

That said, I'm not 100% on how the plot of this wrapped up. They didn't really define the rules of this magic all that specifically. Which is fine, but even after watching I wasn't totally sure why the magic faltered and why it came back. I guess it had something to do with Abuela becoming so obsessed with the powers themselves and how to utilize them that she wasn't appreciating the simple blessing that is your family? So because of that the powers were taken away, and once she learned her lesson they came back? That sounds right but it wasn't totally clear.

That said, I thought the music, the visuals, and the performances and dialogue were just great. The way the house moved and how everyone used their powers gave it a unique feel in a genre that has no shortage of magic. Had a ton of fun with all the songs and their super trippy music videos thanks to the cool power. This Lin Manuel Miranda guy, I think he's gonna be a big star one day. 

I'd probably give this a solid 8/10. Lots of fun, would rewatch, would bump the soundtrack.

Edit: okay so this was the third movie i watched yesterday and I was a bit tired but after some sleep and listening to the soundtrack again it makes much more sense. I was pretty on track, but basically the family was granted the miracle because of how much the grandmother loved and wanted to protect her family. So when she became more obsessed with collecting family members for their powers, like bu forcing marriages or only appreciating her family for what they offer the community, the power started to crack. It seems Maribel was denied power to try and prove a point to Abuela but she refused to listen and only went harder by not appreciating Maribel for what she is. 

I guess I was just thrown because classically Pixar and Disney will clearly define the rules of their magic worlds and then spend the movie breaking them or pushing boundaries. In this movie there aren't so much rules as there are complex family dynamics that are being paralleled by the magic. 

Still really enjoyed this. Loved the way the characters danced and talked and all the types of songs, and especially the visuals. Sticking to my 8/10.

53870,"The best way to view this film is with as large a group of friends as possible. If you are not a Black American, seeing it with a diverse crowd will definitely enhance the experience- the response from fellow viewers adds to the laughs and there is ample opportunity for shared laughs and catharsis.

I saw this with a very fun audience in Brooklyn. The director, Jordan Peele, was present for a Q&A afterwards. One thing he mentioned was that he feels everyone, of all races, has racist tendencies. The main character has to deal with his own assumptions about Black women, for example, as he assumes Georgina(?) the maid was being hostile toward him because she might resent him for being with a white woman. As he said to his girlfriend, ""it's a thing."" And this assumption blocks him from assessing the situation clearly.

JP also mentioned he has several other films planned which will address different social contructs. Really looking forward to them.

My biggest laugh was definitely the Japanese millionaire (an ode to Rosemary's Baby) asking the question about whether being Black was more advantageous or less advantageous. I can't completely coherently describe why that line got me so hard, but as a Black woman who has gone through graduate art school, sometimes the intellectualizing of race gets ridiculous. I have had the experience of sitting within a group of non-Black people and had this question directed at me, and although the person asking is trying to sound academic and intelligent, ultimately the question is too simple and the answers are too complex. And sometimes I have to wonder how anyone with eyes can even ask such a question. In the end, most of us know the social hierarchy of the racial lottery. As a Black woman with a lighter brown skin, finer features and long hair I know I have been given some preferences in life, and it would be disengenuous to suggest otherwise. It kills me when people pretend we don't colorize. We do it amongst humans obviously, then within race. Blondes versus brunettes, etc. And yes, many people have racial envy that goes against the grain. I digress. Very fun film, and I agree it could have been more scary. The showdown scene was too short but there was still a lot to enjoy.

The 'Truth or Dare' scene was the most uncomfortable scene in a movie this year, by far. I loved it. The pool scene & end dinner scene were highlights. I laughed so goddamn hard during the banana sequence. ""I'm pretty sure I made a note somewhere that you hate bananas"" might as well be the best-delivered line in the history of cinema. I love that the father-of-the-year keeps taking beatings but he just never goes down. Really wholesome stuff in this, mixed in with some insanely cringy self-relflection moments that make you almost want to cry about your own middle school experience. Elsie Fisher could easily be up for awards if this wasn't released in July. Gabe was awesome.

Although I did think it missed a 'punch', that something like *Lady Bird* & *Call Me By Your Name* have.The campfire Father/Daughter talk scene went for it but didn't quite get there in my opinion, even though I really wanted it do. There was definitely a Michael Stuhlbarg-like presence/performance needed for that scene to break through.

Best directorial debut of the year by a mile. Elsie Fisher is the breakout star of the summer, insane performance. Every second felt real. Felt more like a documentary than a movie at times. I love that they kept her dialogue real, like her lines were actually written by her, and not by Academy-award winning screenwriter or something. Some coming-of-age films are almost Sorkin-like, no teenager would ever talk like that. That feels like a weird compliment but it's true. I can see myself going to watch this again next week.

15824,"Thought this quote was interesting from Fincher on Welles:

While Fincher is quick to applaud Welles for the clear talent the filmmaker had, the “Mank” director believes that Welles “was above all a showman and a juggler with this immense talent.”


“Well, I think Orson Welles’s tragedy lies in the mix between monumental talent and filthy immaturity,” explained Fincher. “Sure, there is genius in ‘Citizen Kane,’ who could argue? But when Welles says, ‘It only takes an afternoon to learn everything there is to know about cinematography,’ pfff… Let’s say that this is the remark of someone who has been lucky to have Gregg Toland around him to prepare the next shot… Gregg Toland, damn it, an insane genius!”

He continued, “I say that without wanting to be disrespectful to Welles, I know what I owe him, like I know what I owe Alfred Hitchcock, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, or Hal Ashby. But at 25, you don’t know what you don’t know. Period. Neither Welles, nor anyone. It doesn’t take anything away from him, and especially not his place in the pantheon of those who have influenced entire generations of filmmakers. But to claim that Orson Welles came out of nowhere to make ‘Citizen Kane’ and that the rest of his filmography was ruined by the interventions of ill-intentioned people, it’s not serious, and it is underestimating the disastrous impact of his own delusional hubris.”",1

1959,"That's why I thought his mom didn't want her son to go off with Phil cause she knew what he was capable of for the love of her. He would do anything, kill his own father, say he hung himself and he cut him down. Immediately, I thought he murder his father for the sake of his mother and him. Then, she saw that similar masculinity in Phil being mean overly aggressive even in the restaurant. She married George so her son could go to college and have a better life, she knew he was brilliant and saw a way of helping herself and her son by marring a wealthy caring man. I wonder if George had the same experiences with Bronco Henry? I thought that's what Phil wS referring to about the things that when on up in those hills? He then married Rose out of being simplely trying to correct or do the so-called moral thing by marrying her as a cover-up and not just having sex with a woman like Phil said. You don't have to marry them. Implying just have sex with a prostitute or willing woman. I was confused if Phil loved his brother  or if they did things sexual together with each other or Bronco Henry  or if he just knew or what. Them both sleeping in the same bed, after him searching intently for him. That's why she started to get mad at Rose, taking his brother from him. When he was used to things being his way and George always coward to Phil, in the scene, in the bed, after he found him, then in bed toghther and George not looking lije he wanted to be there In my mind that's why George unbuttoned his pants, maybe to pleasure his brother cause it's the only person who knew about him and Phil had a hold on George  and that's why's he would just give in to Phil's demanding ways and name calling. Also, George goes and marries Rose without telling anyone, including Phil, even knowing it would surely make a point that was going to be over. Was George gay also or just confused, maybe? George saw an opportunity with Rose in need of help, support, love or better life. Maybe himself needs her as a shield from Phil or even thought he  could love her.
That's why Gorge didn't want to dance and felt awkward when she wanted to stop looking out into the hills, that might have brought back trauma, or fear of Phil's reaction, or regret his discussion, or just confused on how to be with a woman. Great movie. I guess you can tell it really got my imagination going. I truly wanted more. Thought even more experiences between Phil's attempts to groom him as the next dog, a person who could love him and understand him. George and Phil's parents didn't seem to be affectionate loving parents, especially the way the mother was talked about and overbearing. So Bronco Henry was probably the only love they known.",1

43931,"Saw this the other night. I really liked the original Suspiria and I knew this was an entirely different movie so I went in with an open mind. I love the slow burn of this movie, made me want to pay attention to every detail. A lot of comments here give me the idea that the music by Yorke was polarizing and unfitting, especially in the climax. I personally find Radiohead irritating but I really liked the music here, I found it very engaging especially in the climax. 

The scene with Olga getting totally bent out of shape (understatement) was really well done and horrific, it was this scene that made me afraid that the movie was going to be 2 hours of a ridiculous male fantasy that feels girls getting tortured is somehow deep or edgy, but my fears were dispelled later on. 

The Act 6 climax is totally bonkers and unreal which is what I was hoping to see. A complaint I see is that it looked a little cheesy with the blood effects, and I agree. A little complaint I have is the blocking in this scene: Markos is there, watching over the ritual as Suzie steps in. But I felt really bothered that despite being the top matriarch in the coven, Markos was just kinda like, smooshed into the corner of the scene. I feel like, stylistically, she should have been on some kind of throne or SOMETHING to center her in the scene. This was done quite well with Suzie being revealed as Mother Suspiriorum, but when her spectre of Death comes out and kills Markos, the shots and blocking are really kind of awkward. Like, Death has this totally creepy reveal, but she struts up to Markos who is still in this dumb little corner of the room. Then Death's back is to the camera, and I don't really know how to explain but the positioning of the characters here really bothered me. Felt really awkward. 

That was long winded. I really liked the movie overall though and might see it again! Slight detail: Suzie's mother has heavy, labored breathing and I was reminded of how Markos in the original Suspiria film also had heavy breathing while she slept. Maybe that was a purposeful thing this film did to try and connect Markos to Suzie's mother? Just an interesting little detail that some might pick up. Or maybe I'm wrong, haha.",0

5386,"Honestly, my inclination is to recommend you just watch Transparent instead.

The sense of dread and anxiety was there throughout, but it was bred amongst this backdrop of older Jewish characters, who honestly felt like one-dimensional tropes to me. 

Every non-millenial character in this film was a walking inquistor, who's only purpose at this Shiva was to enquire into the private and professional lives of the millenial guests, mainly the protagonist. Yes, i know - Jewish, Greek, Italian or whatever elders are meant to be intrusive and pushy, but this film just over-did it for me, none of them had an ounce of social awareness, empathy or restraint - it was just unrealistic as part of a film that i thought was seeking to be grounded in relatability. 

Maybe they were meant to be zombified, as if this were a horror film where we're meant to fear what ever corner you turn, you're going to get asked about your career, and if so, that's fine - it works on that level. However, If it's meant to be a realistic look at social dynamics from within Jewish communities, as i said - Transparent does a much better job, it just feels much more reflective of actual lived experiences, rather than just treating the Jewish boomers with disdain off the bat, potraying them as one-dimensional enquiry machines immediately. Transparent treats them as real people, with their own lives they spend their time worrying about. After all, whilst we may have anxiety about the odd remark made about our love-life or career amongst family, you'd have to be pretty narcissistic to assume you would be anywhere near as central to the lives of the every single person at this Shiva, as Rachel Sennot's character is. 

I think my issue is Rachel Sennot's character feels like the only actual character here, and rather than surrounding her with fully formed antagonists, she is surrounded by a selection of lazy Jewish caricatures, that whilst may ring true to some, are essentially stereotypes, stereotypes that exist in a few people you may encounter at a Shiva or Sabbath, but to portray Jewish events as being dominated by them.....eh, it just leaves a sour taste, it's a falsification that only serves to re-enforce to non-Jews that this is what 'we're like'.

Every performance in this film is full of subtle mannerisms and actions that really bring the characters to life with the stand out being Amy Adams who is magnificent. Also Aaron Taylor-Johnson deserves at least an Oscar nomination for his transformative performance. The cinematography is extremely impressive as the DP Seamus McGarvey has to shoot a bleak and stark neo-noir, a romance and a psychological thriller without the transitions being jarring and he pulls it off brilliantly. The narratives are gripping and the way they run parallel with each other using similar themes and events to convey how the main characters feel to the audience is masterful.

I would have liked some differences between his dream and the reality, such as different car, looks etc, even though the outcome of ""driving off into the sunset"" would be the same. In fact the end is like a fairy-tale with the white colours, the sun and the rainbow, they could have even done a reverse dream v reality where his dream is matched by what he expects, so cloudy weather, cheap car etc but overall he's happy, and by paying for his crimes and being able to start afresh, his reality ended up far better.",0

Then after the intermission, Sunrise (cut from the movie) is Benny and Nina’s duet after spending the night together.

50905,"My only critique with the movie was the ""gucci!"" at the end. The time capsule and the high school relationship show how rapid change is. Kayla changes throughout the film. Even her videos change in content and tone. However the cliche phrase im torn on. Does it invalidate a significant portion of the change that Kayla exhibits? While she does seem more mature, does its continued use provide further insight to how immature she really is and balance the endings serious tone? On the other hand it feels ironic because of that perceived realization. Gucci as almost like a fuck you to all the stupid bullshit she just now realizes is stupid. 

Maybe its intended to be ambiguous, maybe im reading too much into it. 

Lastly it's kinda scary how much culture permeates into the lives of young people. The entire make a video, like, subscribe, views, gucci stuff makes a statement about how unavoidable this stuff is. I take my own kid into example (11) and see him parroting things that he's never seen before. Stuff like fornite dancing when he's only played it a couple of times. The dancing however the thing that stuck. Just weird. Makes me think about what that was when I was a kid.

**The Good:**


- The Pacific and Polynesian theme/style direction. My god does the film look gorgeous and a majority of the soundtrack sounds so beautiful. The islands of the Pacific and the ocean as a whole is a backdrop that I feel is just *perfect* for animated movies due to its color and vibrance, but not a lot of animated movies have taken advantage of that. There is Moana, then Lilo and Stitch, Finding Nemo/Dory (Kind of), and both Spongebob Squarepants movies (Kind of). The rich vibrant colors of the green islands contrasting with the wide expansive blue is just so impressive to look at. Same goes for the music, which a lot of it was styled after a very Polynesian theme. Lots of uses of the beautiful chanting chorus as well as the heavy beats of drums combined with the pretty scenery just makes for a great movie.


- Moana herself. She has become one of my favorite Disney Princesses...if you can call her a Princess that is. I suspect Disney marketing will count her as such and I will too. She is the next up in a long line of strong independent Princess leads that has started to crop up, but personally to me I feel Moana is the strongest out of all of them. The way they handled her character (As well as poke fun and subvert the princess tropes of yore) has really escalated herself up into the ranks as some of the best.


- The [*""We Know the Way""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOwVQvAIK-k) song sequence. Oh my god, this part gave me so many chills down my spine. So many chills. To those who need remembering, the sequence is when Moana hits the drum and learns about her people's past through the musical montage of her ancestors sailing the high seas in search of new lands. That whole montage is so fucking beautiful to look at, and the music that accompanies it just makes it feel so much more awesome. The chanting, the drum beats, it is such a great musical montage sequence and has become my favorite part of the movie as a whole.


- Fridge Brilliance (Spoilers): The fact that Te Ka and Te Fiti are both the same goddess. At first I thought it was a rather cheapish cop out when Moana saw the spiral in Te Ka's chest went ahead to place the stone in it. It didn't click in my head until I saw Te Fiti's hand sprout green plants into the ground and I saw the brilliant reason as to why that was; in the Pacific Islands, volcanoes bring both life and death. Where a volcano erupts and the lava flow runs across the land, it destroys everything in its path. But when the flow hardens, it leaves behind nutrient rich soil and soon enough plant and animal life begins to prosper where the destruction once was. I thought that was utterly brilliant.


**The Bad**


- Jemaine Clement's *""Shiny""* song. Sorry to those who rather enjoyed the segment, but that was a low point for me. I felt like it was just unnecessary. Why? It felt *really* out of place to me. In a beautiful soundtrack that was very much inspired by the rhythm and soul of Polynesian culture comes this really weird soft rockish type of song with disco ball-esque lighting and it's just really weird. It honestly felt like a knock off of Genie's song from Aladdin where it takes a musical stylistic approach that is vastly different from the other songs of the movie as well as be a means to be very comedic as well. What I *wish* would have happened is if Tamatoa was a cocky but distinguished crab god, with his song being in a style similar to the [Hawaiian War Chant](https://youtu.be/hQqdeOcd-Zo?t=757) from Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room where he sings and brags all about the treasures he has collected over the years and relates his tales of being awesome while collecting them. It would have given his song a lot of power with booming drums and chanting and actually make him feel *like* the 50 foot crab god he is and not just some throwaway villain.


- The pacing. Overall the movie has a great story, but there were moments where I felt the movie would cut too quickly (The first battle with Te Ka) or drag on forever (The *""Shiny*"" song) where some moments came and went so quick there wasn't really any time to relish upon them and some moments that would linger of for so long that they felt like they overstayed their welcome. The entire movie wasn't like this, but there were definitively moments of that here and there.


Overall, Moana is definitively a fantastic movie that people should go out to see. It has its problems but I still feel it is a really strong product and a great great great addition to the Disney film lineup.


Side note: For those who got it, did anyone find the trailer for Hidden Figures a really odd choice of trailer for this movie? It's wedged in between the new Smurfs movie trailer and the LEGO Batman trailer. You honestly couldn't get a weirder trailer if you could. A better choice honestly would have been the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailer in its place. Not only would it promote more Disney material, but its light and peppy tone would better suit the other trailers instead of a biographical film about three African-American women working at NASA for the Apollo Missions.

This was just an alright movie. But It's the perfect movie-movie. It is exactly what you are expecting and is competently made.

The grandma stole the show. The dad was great. The Uncle/brother was great. Even the mom had a soft spot with me. But Awkwafina could have been played by anyone. And her 'standout' drama scene was lackluster. Ultimately disappointed with her based on the praise going in. And that also being said, I don't think I've seen any movie of hers before that.

2. Real Addy also said the Tethereds went on abandoned for “generations” after the experiment failed, coupled with the fact that they produce seemingly identical offsprings to their real world counterparts, one can assume they don’t have to be “made”. However they were created in the first place they always mirrored their real world counterparts.

3. Since real Addy (Red) was switched with fake Addy, she is obviously different from the rest of the Tethereds and thus they saw her as a “God” or at least a messenger of God, in the dancing scene her movements didn’t mirror exactly those of fake Addy up in the real world, she still had her soul and could act on her own will, so the Tethereds saw in her all the possibilities and formed a cult that kept growing as the years went by I guess.",0

I also loved how the name ""Joe"" can imply many things. There's the Kafka connections, but with the main twist of him not being special, there's also the fact that he's quite literally an ""Average Joe"".

Also, that the nature of the human experience is not meant to be about subjugation, or being a background player yoked to the mundanity of your own existence, but to realize life isn't about work, but leisure... and ""doing whatever you want"" ie not being anchored to the notion you will never ""level up"" and are at a society level ""stasis"" where you watch a ruling class level up, ignore laws, and mod reality with impunity.

72071,"I have an unconventional take on what the characters and ending in Edward's novel represent.

Tony Hastings & Family:

[To me, Tony Hastings doesn't represent Edward, but instead is meant to be Susan.  That means Laura Hastings is Edward, and India Hastings is the aborted child of Susan and Edward.  More reasoning on this in the next sections.](#spoiler)

The Ray Marcus gang:

[This is Susan's ""fate"".  I put fate in quotes because I don't believe it to be unavoidable destiny, with good judgement and strength it can be deterred.  Fate comes at Susan seemingly out of nowhere, just like Tony runs into it while driving down a straight road.  In the novel, Tony is too weak, fearful, and incapable of fighting off the gang.  Similar to how fate overpowers Susan when she is unwilling to work on her relationship with Edward or face her fear of becoming an actual artist rather than just a promoter.  Susan's mother even warned her it would happen eventually, that she would turn into what she used to despise.  When that prediction came true, it cost Susan a spouse and a child, much like Ray Marcus took Tony's spouse and child.](#spoiler)

Detective Andes:

[Detective Andes represents Susan's 2nd husband, Hutton.  Edward wrote Andes as an emotionless dying man, while Hutton turned out to be unfaithful and losing everything professionally.  Now, Edward didn't actually know Hutton, so creating an analogous character in Andes was either foresight or wishful thinking.  Either way, I feel they match.  Andes offered Tony a glimmer of hope during his tragedy, and Hutton did the same for Susan.   Andes promises revenge, Hutton lust/materialism, both of which are fleeting and ultimately unfulfilling.](#spoiler)

Ending:

[Tony eventually finds and takes out Ray, but it leaves him with no sight, no future, and so weak that he falls on his gun, killing himself.  Similarly, Susan pinpoints her ""fate"".  She hates her job, has an absent husband, and is losing grip on her life.  As desperate as Tony's attempt at vigilante justice, Susan sets a meeting with Edward, obviously with romantic intentions based on her dress/makeup.  After sadly waiting hours until it's clear he won't show, Susan sees absolutely no way forward (blinded), and the single tear down her cheek is her figurative death.  Life has now played out exactly as Edward wrote it.  The kicker in this theory is that early in their relationship, Susan complained that Edward was always writing about himself.](#spoiler)",0

Some parts were really funny and clever, but there was a lot of stuff that was just unfunny and trying too hard. I sort of chalked most of the cringey humor to Deadpool, the character, being extremely immature, so I don't have as much of a problem with it as maybe some other people do. That being said, I think they could have dialed it back a little bit and maybe made the film a little darker here and there. They sort of danced around the darker tone a little bit, but I don't feel like they really committed to it as much as they could or should have. I also really enjoyed Ryan Reynolds and, whether you enjoy the movie or not, I think his love for the character really shines through. Deadpool didn't seem as one-dimensional as I feared he would be from the trailers. That being said, it felt like I had already seen most of this movie in the various trailers. And I don't say all of this as a riff on ""They always show everything in the trailers! Blah Blah Blah"" but rather that I didn't really feel like this movie surprised me in any way. At first, it was kind of interesting how the origin/flashback aspect of the story was structured throughout the whole movie, but after the first hour I think it actually hurt the film's pacing. 

The movie was a little better than I expected it to be, but nowhere near as good as a lot of people are praising it as. I was entertained, and I enjoyed Ryan Reynolds' performance, but after watching it I kind of felt really underwhelmed and wished I'd just spent my money on something else. ",0

31270,"My first reaction/theory about the ending was that the “twist” didn’t actually matter. The Tethered and the Actual are the same in the end. The Tethered are the worst quality of their actual.  For example, the dad’s friend drank and was a bit of a jerk to his wife and his Tethered acted drunk and was a jerk (helping hand tease) to the actual wife.  His wife was obsessed with appearance, so her Tethered was as well to the extreme by cutting her own face.

But the lines are blurred with Adelaide and Red. The fake took the actual’s place in the world, but ultimately became a good person while the real one became a revengeful psychopath. The real one embraced her negative traits while the fake one moved from them.  If we forget about the “twist” switch, the movie is about how a woman experienced a traumatic event but learned to cope and move on. If we include the twist, it is still about how a woman experienced a traumatic event but learned to cope and move on. 

So I guess the moral I got from it is that your negative traits and past are a part of you no matter what, but it is up to you how you handle them. The twist is a trick to make the audience think that it mattered that the switch was important. Does this make the fake Adelaide the real villain of the movie while Red is the underdog trying to take back what was hers? No, because it is their actions that matter, not their past situations.",0

Definitely as a result of her Mennonite upbringing but it made me wonder if it was done to hint at her true being.

Finally, the final act with Suzy opening her chest reminds me  of the Catholic Mother Mary specifically the depictions of  Our Lady of Guadalupe with her burning heart. 

The only thing I wished was one of the other girls (Patricia, olga, or Sarah) would have asked to live. Part of me thinks they wanted to and Suspirium was powerful enough to convince them otherwise, or maybe she is a merciful Mother.",0

And then to build on that, [when the creature chose to save Elisa and bring her with him, rather than just escaping to the sea alone, I thought that showed that he was truly reciprocating those feelings of love.

19364,"The movie was eh.

I think it's because the set up was weak. The initial conflict came from him finally on the verge of ""making it"" in the business, but we were never there for the struggle and passion. We were simply told for a few minutes that it was his life's spark. Then we're jerked away from it by all of a sudden landing dead in purgatory?

The world of souls also never felt like there was any heart in it. Birth and death are things that inspire spirituality and deep emotions, and I felt like Coco did this beautifully. There was so much detail and color. It took only a glance to feel and see that it was a rich, vibrant world.

In Soul, everything you see feels so plain in comparison. It's an assembly line managed by abstract cosmic beings who randomly assign personalities. While not dealing with birth or death, Inside Out does an excellent job of playing around with deep subjects of loss, transformation, and complex emotion and even lightly touching on concepts we're familiar with: random jingles that play in our heads, dreams, lost memories, trains of thought, abstraction, imagination. Soul does not build this world well at all.

And to skip ahead, after every painstaking effort Joe goes through to play with Dorothea, he just doesn't ""feel it"" anymore? In the beginning of the film, we see him come alive when he plays for his students and at his audition with Dorothea. It's never clear what the relationship was between a newfound appreciation for what we many of us may dismiss or mistake for ""plain living"" and a passionate pursuit of a dream.

The film falls apart at that point for me.

Side note: The land of lost souls was such an interesting topic, and I wish they had given this more loving attention. Becoming mired in doubt and meaningless endeavors or getting lost in ""flow"" can both lead to a loss of connection with the world. This needed more emotion.

I think my favorite thing was how it didn't use any bullshit military movie cliches. No redemption for Cillian Murphy. Tom Hardy didn't clear the Cliffs of Dover by 2 inches and land his out of fuel plane on friendly soil, nor did he die a heroic on screen death. The suspense around getting his gear down, doing his duty by burning the plane then becoming a POW with no other resolution was the exact opposite of a Michael Bay version. There was no corporal saluting Tom Cruise's court room bravery or Matt Damon saluting a tombstone or any other forced effort to show reverence and respect by having an actor snap to and fire off the stiffest salute they could muster. God I hate cliched salutes in military movies.

We see stoic bravery (as British bravery should be represented haha) yet we also see the cowardice and fear that is played out along an entire arc. Some movies will show an act of cowardice, or a soldier scared and overly dramatically calling for his momma, but then the movie gets right back to the heroing that need to be done. 

We start with Tommy doing whatever he can to get out of Dunkirk and then he spends the rest of the movie doing the same thing while...sorry, whilst his fellow soldiers calmly queue on the beach. Cillian Murphy looking back and seeing George's body being pulled off the boat and turning and disappearing in to the crowd was jarring to me. ",1

26062,"Perhaps it is too late to make my thoughts known on this movie. But here it is anyways.  


I hated this movie. Specifically, Vanessa Kirby's character made me absolutely dislike this movie.  


**Shia LaBeouf:**   
His role in the movie was just amazing. The controversy sorrounding his personal life have clouded the greatness of his performance.  LaBeouf had his name removed from Netflix’s ‘For your awards consideration’ page promoting the film.   
I loved the opening sequence and the birth scene. The acting was really good. From the start, Shia LaBeouf ate up the role. This working man trying to help his wife's decision to have a natural birth at home. Everytime he spoke, every  interaction he had with the nurse and his wife. He was captivating. When he cries! ""Why are you trying to disappear my kid?"" That got me.

&#x200B;

**Ellen Burstyn:**  
[The scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72E-6LbQABE) she argues with the daughter in the dining room. That is an award worthy performance.

**Vanessa Kirby:**  
Was boring. This is not her fault. the role was written that way. You cannot build a movie to end in an unrealistic court confrontation between Vanessa Kirby and Ellen Burstyn. It's unreal. And that's why I hate this movie. 

&#x200B;

**The ending**: Was not special. It just felt like a kid's fantasy at this point.

28272,"I love the inclusion of the diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder for Penny. That is a very REAL condition that has grown more prominent over the past several decades in our society. It's a part of the group of cluster b disorders (borderline, narcissistic, histrionic and antisocial). These disorders are characterized by brief, fleeting periods of intense love and support often followed by long, drawn out periods of horrendous psychological, emotional and sometimes physical abuse. This is peppered in with the occasional, albeit fleeting, recycling of loving and supportive behavior. Children who are raised by parents who have these disorders adapt in ways that make no sense to other people just to survive.

Imagine if you simultaneously loved your mom but were terrified of her as well? During the times when she's loving, all is well with you and your world. But when she's not, the child *must* develop coping strategies in order to survive until the ""good parent"" shows up again. Otherwise, the child wouldn't be able to survive. The feeling of not being able to trust your primary caregiver, when you're a child, because of their inconsistent treatment of you is the most terrifying thing a human being can experience. Those coping strategies that are developed in response are often life long and rigid.

Now, look at the Joker's laugh he developed when he is feeling intense anxiety, sadness, depression and/or shame (shame is the most devastating feeling a human being can experience, btw). And then think about his mother, who's clinically ill, saying ""he always seemed so happy"". That is DARK as shit, but it's very real. Arthur had to develop that laugh in order to cope with his mother's abuse. That scene where Arthur is laughing the hardest of the whole movie in the stairwell because he's looking at official documents diagnosing his mother as mentally ill and responsible for the way he turned out is actually really moving. The second time I saw the movie I was almost moved to tears by this scene. Arthur knows he's sick but up until this point doesn't know why. Upon finding out that the only person he really seems to love, care about and have a connection with is the cause of it? No Bueno. That was the tipping point. That's why he broke into that girl's apartment. He needed some connection from someone, anyone and it's made all the more worse when we realize he fantasized every encounter with that woman.

Bravo to Todd Phillips for incorporating this type of thing into a mainstream movie. It's remarkable to see a superhero origin story from this perspective. I'd imagine we'll see more movies in the upcoming years that address mental illness and loneliness and it's effect on society as a whole. I'm hoping we're in the beginning stages of really addressing mental illness and personality disorders so that in the future we'll be able to eradicate them.

27278,"I have to say that was one of the best movies I’ve ever seen. 

I spent the first act amazed by De Niro’s storytelling and scene setting. What a perfect intro for Pesci’s character. From the first line you can immediately see that this guy holds the strings. Honestly this was probably the most intimidating out of the three Pesci crime characters (DeVito, Santoro, and Buffalino).  The scene where Frank is casually talking about murdering POW’s and you can immediately see that Frank is the perfect soldier: strong, smart, careful, determined, loyal, and most of all didn’t question orders. 

Then Pacino steps in and the story takes off. Man did Pacino steal every scene he was in. Probably a top 3 Pacino performance in my books. They show the sub story with the Kennedy assassination to add depth to the characters and it was beautifully weaves into the second act. The scenes with Tony Pro and Pacino were legendary. Who wears shorts to a meeting? You’re more than ten minutes late you’re saying something. Just the way Pacino commanded the room as Jimmy Hoffa would have was legendary. And then there’s the end of the second act where what we all know happens happens and it’s perfect. It’s not a slowed down shot of Pacino falling to the floor with a violin playing in the background, it was a hit just like any of the other hits. I could really write more about how impressed I was with the second act of this film. It was probably 2.25 hours long and it felt like 30 minutes. 

And then it gets better and the themes of the movie begin to hit. Begins with a gutsy decision to give Peggy one line in the movie and it pays off beautifully. She truly saw through Frank, I believe even more so than the other daughters all the way to the very end. De Niro calling Jo incredible acting. I could feel the guilt and remorse in De Niro for the first time in this movie and it really adds to the theme of how ugly the gangster world gets. And then scene by scene it gets darker and darker and darker and we see how truly alone every single one of the gangsters ended up. Pesci in the prison playing that bowling type game and then being wheeled off to his deathbed. It then finishes with the conclusion to De Niro’s character and man is that shit sad. You can see it so clearly that De Niro is feeling some sort of guilt and remorse at that point. The leaving scene of the priest absolving Frank of his sins and then telling him he’s leaving and Frank asks him to leave the door open in hopes that someone will show that they care about him. 

Truly a sad film to its core. I felt very similarly to how I did at the end of raging bull. Scorsese really knows how to hit your soul with his movies. Also obligatory typical camerawork Scorsese compliment but as always Scorsese’s camera work is best in the business by far. Nobody does the slow moving camera mimicking a person walking through a scene at the same pace as the music in the background. Legendary. And yes the editing too, to make 3.5 hours feel like 1.5 hours takes an extreme amount of hard work and skill in your craft.

I’m going to have to watch it 2 more times b4 I can put it in my rankings but after my first watch probably going to find itself in my top 3 (yes I know basic r/movies movies but hey I like what I like)

Russia is far from being a shiny heavenly place but it's not a European equivalent of North Korea either. I really wish filmmakers would at least visit Russia to see what it looks like before attempting to portray it in the movie or at least hire some Russian consultants.

I am impressed by Awkwafina's acting in particular, the monologue scene that follows Aiko's earing search was a highlight for her. The actress who played Nai Nai deserve kudos too. Everyone else was also good. 

The movie definitely seem to tackle ethnocentrism and American arrogance(Billi and her parents) given how it ends with Nai Nai beating the odds. I'm not Chinese American so I couldn't relate to the overall plot though.

54756,"After thinking on it, I believe that what Reynolds Woodcock truly wanted was a mother.  Alma became a contender for that role by feeding him, referring to him as her 'hungry boy'.  He criticized her appearance but said that he'd make her beautiful, or in other words shape her into the woman he wanted by putting her to the test by being a stubborn boy with behavior like his picky eating (refusing to enjoy vegetables the way she prepares them) and complaining.

When he became sick, his mother appeared as a ghost that he longed for and reached out to, but who didn't respond.  Then Alma enters and it's when she starts tending to him and caring for him that the ghostly figure disappears.

In the end, he got what he truly wanted, a woman who literally made him eat his vegetables (yeah, yeah I know, actually mushrooms) and care for him like the mother he longed for.

Or possibly, this was just Giles' fantasy of Elisa gaining gills so she could be with the Asset forever rather than the more likely truth that she simply died. This could also stem from Giles' feeling that Elisa and the Asset were ""meant to be together"" leading to him constructing an ending to the story that shows that she was always part of the same species as the Asset.

42991,"My theory: Paimon can only transfer hosts through decapitation and carries the souls of those he has captured with him.

Grandma, the host of Paimon, dies. Cult digs up the grave and decapitates her, freeing Paimon. 
Paimon occupies the body of a pidgeon which seeks out Charlie. Charlie had been groomed and breastfed by grandma and was the next obvious host for Paimon. Charlie decapitates the bird. Paimon then occupies the body of Charlie. 

The cult members want a male host and scheme to transfer Paimon into Peter's body. They put their mark on the telephone pole where Charlie is then decapitated. Traumatized, Peter keeps driving and does not look once at the backseat. The first person to find Charlie is Annie, who is then possessed by Paimon in her moment of vulnerability as she cries for her daughter. Annie screams that she must kill herself, the pain is unbearable. Annie always had an intuitive compulsion to kill her children, as she subconsciously wanted to destroy potential hosts for Paimon. With Paimon inside her, she feels compelled to destroy herself.

Annie meets Joan who coordinates the transferral of Paimon from Annie to Peter. Annie is able to conjur the spirit of Charlie because Paimon carries the souls of those he has captured. Unbeknownst to the fam, Annie carries more souls than just Charlie's. Paimon begins taking increasing control of the increasingly vulnerable Annie.

In the attic, Annie cuts off her head, freeing Paimon's spirit and the souls of those he has captured. Paimon follows Peter out the window, finally arriving into the male form he desired. Carrying the spirit of Charlie, Paimon, and the other past hosts, Peter makes the same clicking sound as his sister.

TLDR; Each time we see a decapitation, the spirit of Paimon is transferred to the next most vulnerable host, carrying with him the captured souls of the previous hosts.

For example - I was expecting Shirley to find some racists in a bar or a similar location, as it has been shown in media, but the way it was played out with Tony's bullshitting was outstanding. It was also an amazing detail for a later part of the movie. Another example was at the very end of the film - once you hear the doorbell in Tony's house, I was expecting Shirley at the door.

First off, in the movie they make it clear he's also a loner looking for a friend and admits that only he calls himself that (after being asked 'why do people call you podcast?').

But the main thing I dislike about these comments is I bet a bunch of the people making them would list The Goonies as a classic kid/family adventure film that is similar in tone to this flick and they would NEVER complain or point out that **THREE** of the main kids in the cast are named Chunk (the fat one), Mouth (the sarcastic talkative one), and Data (the smart/tech/gadget kid).

14587,"I'm curious if you (and others here, too) are aware that [Nomadland](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a35538486/nomadland-fern-true-story-jessica-bruder-linda-bob-swankie-now/) is actually based on a book about real people, real struggles, and real life? 'Fern' is real, Bob is real, Swankie is real; [Empire, Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire,_Nevada), is real, and so are the mining plant that closed and the people who lost their jobs and homes that were provided by the company. There are hundreds of (real) older Americans who, after working their whole lives, feel they have been failed by the system and as though have no other purpose, nowhere else to go. So they become Nomads. 

This film wasn't meant to be dramatic; it was meant to be, to use your word, a mediation on grief, confusion, loss, and, above all else, acceptance. These aren't just ""old people,"" these are humans trying to not give up on themselves the way society has given up on them. In addition—and you may not like this, and I'm prepared for that—Fern and most of her close (platonic) friendships are women; all the other movies you listed have male leads.

I will admit that something that irked me about the film was that Fern did, actually, have not one not two but three places and friends with whom she could comfortably reside, as I'm really not sure if that's the case for many real-life Nomads. I also didn't really like how she, in her sister's words, was ""always seen"" as eccentric; I'm certain that a lot of Nomads always lived and craved a comfortable life, and then became nomadic not because they love ""being free,"" but because they felt short of options.

Everyone's talking about Cleo, but the scene that really got me was the scene with Sofia and the kids at the restaurant near the end.

I get that the Oscar is for a performance, not a cumulative set of them but one could argue the Academy always doles out “make-up” Oscars. Gary Oldman, Martin Scorcese, Leo diCaprio, etc. have all won for not even close to their best performances and arguably were not even the best of their respective categories the year they won. So the Academy has always considered that extraneous stuff.

Chazelle has quickly become one of my favorite filmmakers. Whiplash is one of my favorite movies in recent years, but he outdid himself here. The minute the opening number hit I was in love. Each original song was amazing, Justin Hurwitz is excellent. I like his work here more than in Whiplash. The CinemaScope was a great touch, it looked and felt like old Hollywood, which was likely the point. I was extremely impressed with Stone and Gosling's performances, as well. Emma Stone has quickly become my absolute favorite actress and I expect her to get the Oscar for this performance, and I think Casey Affleck is the only thing that will stop Gosling, but that will not take away from Gosling's sterling performance. Going to see it for a second time today, which I rarely do in theaters. Honestly one of my favorite pictures ever.  ",1

You meet him when he's starting fights at hockey practice, he had sex with his girlfriend the night his father died, he was a cheater, he was a jerk to that drummer kid, and he wasn't going to college at the end.

But holy shit that was good. 

I mean other than the obvious ""racism is bad, everyone is equal"" morals/metaphors/allegories, it was really subtle too. There were some parts where I went ""wow that was really clever"". 

I went in expecting a solid 6-7/10, campy, catering to young kids, wanting to sell toys and spinoffs. What I got was a solid 9/10, with great story telling, amazing characters, tremendous writing and acting, and more subtlety than expected. 

The only part I really can complain about is that awful shakira song. So hamfisted and forced, and really doesn't fit the mood at all. But that wasn't *that* bad. I just hated it. 

Seriously though, if you're on the fence about seeing it, do it! It's seriously good. Honestly I was blown away by it. It's not just your average campy disney movie trying to sell toys, and create a myriad of spin-offs and cash-ins. It's actually a good standalone movie, with a fantastic story and all the stuff I already said.

Hawke and the two kids are great and it's very atmospheric, but Hawke's in it a lot less than I was expecting and the whole phone concept feels kinda one-note and repetitive. I was hoping the gimmick would kinda go in some more creative directions but there's not a whole lot to it.

Also the subplot with the sister felt really tacked on, even though I thought the actress who played the sister was really really good.

I would've preferred it to just stay with the brother and maintain a sense of claustrophobia rather than cutting back outside.

Hawke's brother also felt like a character who didn't even need to be in this. I like James Ransone as much as the next guy but his character was just nothing.

The story is using the end of the world theme, and that theme comes with the hard choices it takes to survive in that new world, especially coming from the civilized one. Characters need to develop and change and that change takes heroic effort, this guy was just running towards a goal without ever addressing why and how he was going to get there.

The short answer from the book is tax evasion/fraud. Maurizio Gucci was basically cooking the books and embezzling money from the Gucci company to fund his family's extravagant lifestyle. We also see InvestCorp confront him directly about this later when they offer to buy him out.

Italy's IRS were also after Maurizio due to his wife, Patrizia, forging his father's signature so that Maurizio could gain access to his shares in the Gucci company, and Gucci's money. This is also covered in the movie, with the scene where they tell Maurizio he has to pay an inheritance tax.

Also see: [""Gucci Heir Gets Suspended Sentence for Attempted Fraud""](https://apnews.com/article/e9ed4093b2324c6793835d1858787ed5) (c. 1988)

>Maurizio Gucci, an heir of the founder of the Gucci luxury goods company, was convicted of attempted tax fraud Monday, and given a $750 fine and a one- year suspended sentence.  
>  
>Vittorio Ajello, the lawyer for Gucci, said the decision means Gucci will regain control of shares that will give him half of the company.  
>  
>**Gucci was accused of having arranged the falsification of the signature on the documents to avoid paying inheritance taxes by making it appear that his father, Rodolfo, transferred ownership of the shares before his death in 1983.**  
>  
>Gucci’s ownership of the shares was not in question, only when the transfer was made. The court froze the shares to assure he could pay any fine levied in the tax fraud case.  
>  
>He had faced a possible penalty of three years in jail and a fine of about $23 million.  
>  
>However, the court fined Gucci only $750. It also gave him a one-year suspended sentence and said his criminal record will be expunged at the end of the year. **Gucci also must pay the inheritance tax on the shares.**  
>  
>The court also convicted Gucci employees Gian Vittorio Pilone and Ciro De Vincenzo, the notary that authenticated the signatures, of the same charges. The two were given the same suspended sentence and fine. The court also prohibited De Vincenzo from acting as a notary for one year.  
>  
>**The court also acquitted four others, including a woman accused of actually signing the documents.**

It was pretty good and it really 'refreshes' the material by jumping back and forth in time.

SPOILERS

It was a smart thing to hold off on Laurie confessing his love to jo near the end, as this is the emotional heart of the story - and plays a crucial part in inspiring her to write the book (at this point in her life she has just lost her sister and lost him  - and the book is getting some of her own agency back).

I will say though, although I think Chalmant was good casting for Laurie, I wish he had 'deepened' his voice to sound more like an adult in his Paris/post-Paris scenes - it would have made his change of heart about which sister to choose make more sense.

My biggest questions about the film was adding the 'meta' element of having Jo's 'happy ending' with Bhaer be a fantasy as a means to get a better deal on selling the book.

On the surface I like the idea - but it sent me back to the wiki page on the real life of Louisa May Alcott and from that saw that Little Women  is not strictly 'autobiographical' and much (the romance with Laurie for example) is fantasy. Also, in contrast to the movie, in real life Alcott's publisher kept bugging her to write a kids book. 

In other words, much of what the film  presents as 'reality' is just another layer of fantasy projected upon the book. Its weird.

END OF SPOILER

43005,"To the viewers who didn’t like the supernatural turn, the ending could be interpreted as non-supernatural imo. Joan and the cult believe that Paimon was successfully transferred to Peter. But like real life cults, what they believe isn’t necessarily true-just because they believe that Paimon is a real entity, doesn’t mean Paimon actually exists. Its not only the mother and son who could be suffering from delusions. 
At the ending scene, Peter just stares dazedly around, there’s nothing explicit that confirms or denies that he isn’t Peter anymore, other than Joan’s words, and the ghostly lights-which for all we know, could all be in Peter’s mind, just like all the strange things he witnesses throughout the film.

Paimon could be taken as a metaphor for schizophrenia, which hits men harder and earlier. It says it right there in the film title; the family has a history of mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, which is hereditary. Peter was at the age where the average onset occurs for men. That, combined with a traumatic trigger and all that pot jumpstarts his hallucinations. Of course, a supernatural interpretation is valid and makes sense as well but I think a non-supernatural interpretation is equally valid and believable.",0

My point is: Are you physically being denied entrance to the class? Are the professors testing you with unfair standards?

If the answer to both questions is not, then it is two way problem: One, plain old stupidity from someone saying that and two, low self-steem from the one in the receiving end. To do great thing it's necessary to exhibit great courage in the face of adversity not complain over and over and over again. We know the girl can be in that class and instead of joining the rant club to shout *microagression*, *patriarchy* or *depression* go and study and show those f*ckers you can be the best in the class, build your reputation in the industry as a high-performing professional, innovate, create a company. be a mentor for other people. There is when real and actual change comes. Not when you go to an Ivy League college and block access for every single fucking student because you're protesting against cis-opression and micro-agressions.

We're not golden coins to be loved by everybody. Part of being a grown up is realizing this and gaining grit. 

Words are simply words, and unless they translate into factual things, they're just that: Words. You want to create awareness to this issues, then stop referring to every single thing as an agression as that devalues more serious issues and just annoy people. Make your campaign, explain your points in a serious and informed way trying to change the mind of people, not bashing them until either they give in for social pressure or outright lash out.

Martin Luther King stood his ground using non-violent means, raising awareness via speeches and demonstrations. There's a very big difference between ""The white shitlords are opressors... this and that ""tiers""  of agressions..."" and ignoring the hateful letters, setting an example and telling them that you just have a dream that your children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. 

Guess which option is annoying and which one can make people stop, be aware, empathize and support you in the changes you want to achieve.

Her case had no leads, there was nothing anyone could do; why would she burn down the police station? Stabbing the dentist? Wasting her money on those billboards? Like Woody's character said, the only way the case would be solved would be through sheer luck and ""stupidity"". And that's exactly what almost happened. The case was a dud.

It was good. I'm just going to vomit out some of my random thoughts and observations:
Just got home from this film.

It was good. I'm just going to vomit out some of my random thoughts and observations:

Main themes: heteronormative and gender societal constructs, parent/child relationships, revenge

I'll start with what I thought the chief theme was: Gender roles and masculinity/femininity.
-Edward Sheffield exhibits a struggle with masculinity - it's revealed that in his childhood he lacked a father figure, he takes up creative writing as his education which is a feminine career, there's also this recurring discussion about him and weakness. He's not an archetypal male provider with his writing income causing Susan to leave him for a wealthier and seemingly more ""successful"" man who can provide. Hutton Morrow is tall, handsome, rich and successful. Armie Hammer excels in this character well but I can only imagine he's tired of playing this role: from gossip girl, to Winklevoss on the social network and now to Hutton Morrow. Hutton is a rich, handsome, masculine womanizing businessman. But his main claim to success, his business, is revealed to be failing. So beyond his appearance, he's emasculated. Sheffield's novel is his retribution and his medium of validation. He portrays himself in his novel which is important and meaningful. It allows him to define himself. He's seen as weak, not being able to sacrifice himself and protect his family from 3 nocturnal animals like a man should at the beginning. Some important imagery is when we see him in a flannel and ample facial hair, which are archetypes of masculinity, and in it he's pushed around by 3 guys and rendered defenseless and weak. Only after he loses his wife and daughter does the facial hair come off which mirrors his real life character - always depicted without facial hair or beard. The scene of Tony in the shower is an inflection point in this portrayal - it's the point where he washes those constructs away. Sheffield rejects the notion that he's weak, this is probably something he's struggled with his whole life trying to prove himself. Then his character, Tony, validates his masculinity and removes his ""weakness"" by killing his nemesis in a variation of a Texas standoff, the manliest duel. He then shoots his gun in the air in celebration and then promptly dies with a feeling of contentment. There's irony in that character death. The setting of Texas, acts as a great character foil and thematic foil. Texas is a state that embodies masculinity - from cowboy culture, to football, to guns, etc. Susan references her gay brother who has had to deal with a similar struggle. She admires her brother ""Cooper"" I think is his name and and once admired and respected Sheffield for those same traits. The 3 bad guys, were actually small in stature and juvenile and boyish in appearance yet they are the grotesque and inhuman men. This is Ford's meditation on what makes a man and what a man looks like - it's not the stereotypical Texas tough guy or rich man making business deals. It's a man who has the courage to believe in his craft, in his art, in himself. I bet Ford sees a lot of himself in his character. In fact Ford has childhood roots in Texas. Ford is also inspired by minimalism. The seminal art of Prada Marfa I think was an inspiration for the film and for Ford. Prada Marfa is a pop art sculpture replica of the famous and influential fashion house, Prada's, retail store situated in a obscure area near Marfa Texas alongside a vast middle-of-nowhere road. In such a desolate area devoid of the trappings of high culture, there's this exhibit of modern minimalist art, a Prada store. This tension and irony and dichotomy is kind of paralleled in the novel, Nocturnal Animals. Like A Single Man there's ample minimalism porn throughout the film. Minimalism is a great vessel to encapsulate Ford's discussion on his characters' relationships. The most masculine character we see is Detective Bobby and internally he's facing a battle with weakness and emasculation - he's dying of cancer but also he's lonely. He's without any family or love in his life and thus he's willing to risk it all. In critical moments, he's hacking up a cough and rendered defenseless - always relinquishing his gun, to Tony. Ford alludes to some social commentary with guns and how they apply to male culture and act as masculine security blankets if you will. In the movie they are used as tools to force opponents into submission, but they are tools that are depicted as defeated or overcome when the bad guys are able to escape. Also, it's really important how the trio of rapist murderers did not use a gun in their hijacking. It's unrealistic, especially in Texas, for none of them to be carrying, but the lack of gun or weapon is a meaningful void. Moreover, whenever one of the trio are isolated from a group, he's depicted as weak and defenseless. We first see Lou alone while he's arrested and in custody. We first see Ray Marcus alone when he's naked and vulnerable on a toilet. This is Ford's meditation on the grotesque and evil patriarchy which thrives only in numbers and as a collective. 

-I knew right of the bat this movie would center around gender/heteronormative deconstruction and their roles in relationships when we were early on introduced to a non-traditional relationship of a gay man married to a woman. It was a good foreshadowing of the Morrow relationship - these aren't relationships founded in love, they're symbiotic relationships - mutualistic, parasitic, and commensal. Susan Morrow faces this constant struggle between living an authentic life of love and then living an empty life of wealth and easiness. She's battling with gender norms. Her mother embodies female traditionalism - ""a man should be a provider of women."" It's easy to pick up on this dichotomy when Susan harps on about being practical and a realist. Notice also how the happiest and earliest depiction of Susan is her without makeup. Like beards and facial hair, makeup is another gendered archetype, but of femininity. The scene where she's reflecting on herself in the mirror and removes her typical makeup and lipstick and ""relaxes"" her look to be more authentic when she's getting ready to meet up with Edward again at the restaurant is powerful. She's hoping that this is her chance to feel a life of love and fulfillment again. She's removing superficiality and returning to authenticity and love - which she now lacks in her revealed unhappy life. Recall how when Susan's friend pointedly asks her if she loved Hutton. Conveniently, she escapes from the question.  Susan's biggest fear is turning into her mother. Throughout the movie we see this mother/daughter motif - with the two dead bodies laying next to each other, then quickly transitioned to the scene of Susan's daughter laying naked in the bed in the same position. I think Susan's biggest fear on the phone is that her daughter will be as unhappy as her - that her daughter would become her daughter's mother. However, Susan's daughter is obviously in love and speaks on the phone with a tone of happiness, comfort, and content which is juxtaposed to Susan's worried, scared and dreadful tone.  The mother/daughter dichotomy reaches a climactic point when Susan runs into her coworker who shows her a video feed of her baby daughter and becomes frightened from a horrific visualization. Susan Morrow is not in paradise. She's in sorrow with her relationship with Hutton and her closely similar surname reflects that. She's sad, lonely, not in love, and even sexless. She can't run from this *reality* of her life either. Which was alluded briefly in the beginning when she was unable to turn off the tv that was playing sex programming and talking about how cum had the consistency of coconut water. On the outside, Susan Morrow has it all, a nice house a handsome and rich husband, but there are now coconuts in Susan's ""paradise"" as the couple is going broke, sexless, and facing marriage difficulties. She longs to experience this idea of tropical paradise too as she begs to go to the beach with her husband who declines. Edward once told her when two people are in love they must try to make it work. She didn't believe in that then and now Susan is stuck in her own prison of not being in love or happy with a guy who she knows is cheating on her and trying to make it work. 

A lot of people in this thread are really focusing on revenge as a theme, and yes, it's a theme but I don't think it's the most important. There is deeper and richer meaning within Nocturnal Animals. 

Lastly, is the importance of the title. Obviously he 3 hijacker rapist murderers are nocturnal animals. But nocturnal animals applies more broadly to all humans - and is really a depiction of the human condition. We are animals, and at night we are nocturnal. Susan is a nocturnal animal plagued with nightmares, and unable to sleep. Edward is a nocturnal animal, writing  away his redemption novel. Detective Bobby is a nocturnal animal, lonely and savage. Hutton is a nocturnal animals always escaping away and having sex with women besides his wife. Ford really conveyed the animalistic side of humans.

The only gripe I have about Ford is that his techniques seem a little too filmschool studenty. He has visually stunning cinematography and a penchant for aesthetics and picture which is great but he uses techniques sometimes in too literal of a way. I had the same gripe about A Single Man. It needs to be more seamless and fit in with the whole production rather than come off as forced, contrived and hastily included. ",0

21025,"I think the most compelling aspect of the film for me was the fact that it wasn’t a definitive pro-Black film. 

Yes, there were major elements of the film that were meant to uplift and glorify the Black community: the stock footage of important actors and agents in the civil rights movement, the whole “Black people were and are victims of systemic racism” narrative, gorgeous use of Marvin Gaye’s music, etc. 

But the film also presented many issues that the Black community may consider uncomfortable to confront and speak about: PTSD and mental health in general, emotional sensitivity of men towards other men, their own xenophobia as Americans, etc. 

And for this to be released when BLM sentiment is at an all-time high, imho, makes Spike Lee one of the bravest directors this year.

60237,"I have a few gripes with this movie. Overall it was solid, but its overall quality makes those little bits of annoyance stand out that much more, because surely it occurred to Edgar Wright at some point that these flaws were there and he just didn't have the time necessary to iron them out.

The dynamic between Doc and Baby was weird. The whole premise of Baby working for him was that he was earning back what he'd stolen, but Doc let him steal it in the first place. And even still, did Baby not make any money from stealing from him? Did he immediately spend all the money he got from it? If not, he could've just given back the money. The premise itself is flawed, it pretends like Baby genuinely thinks he's indebted to this person and then he'll eventually be let go. Doc shows himself to be an asshole eventually, that he refuses to let Baby go even after the debt is paid, and at that point all pretense of civility should be out of the window, he's holding him against his will at gunpoint. Why would Doc believe Baby would continue to drive for him? He's a great driver and it sucks to lose such a talent at your disposal, but the alternative is what ended up happening, which is that Baby gets tired of your shit and you end up fucked, which you had to see coming, especially since Doc insists on continually hiring at least one person per heist that outright shit-talks and hates on Baby for no reason. It's such a common occurrence that he carries on his person no less than three sunglasses at all times, because invariably they end up taking them or fucking with him somehow.

So why. Why hire people that make your drive unhappy? For that matter, why hire people that are mentally unstable? Bats may or may not be insane, it could just be a front, but either way he killed a cashier for literally no reason, jeopardizing the entire crew. And of course he killed your arms dealer and all your corrupt cops. Why would you have this person on your team *once*, much less *twice*? And Doc knew all about him, Bats himself touts how everyone on the street knows him. He tells Baby, ""You know I don't use the same exact group more than once, right?"" which at the time I took to mean ""You won't have to deal with Bats again"". Except naw, he's right fucking there in the very next heist he puts together.

Why was Baby recording everything? I know the reason he gives, that he likes to make music out of stuff, but it's the stupidest part of the entire movie. He knows he's doing illegal shit. He knows he's working with killers. He knows that if he gets found out that he's in danger. Why would he do this? He stands to gain nothing from it. He could walk down the street on his own time and make recordings of that. He's supposed to be a smarter character than this would suggest, and on top of it it doesn't even end up mattering in the plot! What's the point!

Possibly the most minor gripe is when Darling dies. She and Buddy are in a shootout with the cops, and she just walks out in front of the car she was using as cover and starts shooting and is immediately gunned down. What the fuck! Why! How fucking stupid is she? It wasn't even like she was doing it to distract them so Buddy could get away, he ended up having to still shoot his way out of the situation after she died. She literally did it for no reason other than so that Buddy could get pissed off at Baby.

But it all comes down to Doc. He's the mastermind character. He has information on everyone. He plans everything out ahead of time. He continually allowed Baby to work in a hostile environment - he didn't go out of his way to make sure he felt safe or valued, despite him being ultimately the most important part of every heist. Everyone can shoot a gun, everyone can put money in a bag. Only Baby could drive like that. But he allowed him to be treated like shit, and that ultimately fucked him over. And he did it consistently enough that Baby could come to expect it every time. It's like he's smart when the plot needs him to be and stupid when the plot needs him to be. If he was actually as smart as every other aspect of the movie wants us to believe, this wouldn't have happened.

Another minor gripe is that veteran guy who randomly shows up with fully automatic weapons ready in his truck shooting at them in public. I was 100% ready for that to be a plot twist - that was the last job until Baby was freed, maybe Doc hired a hitman to take the team out to ensure he couldn't work for anyone else afterward. Nope! Just some random guy with fully automatic smg's in his truck happened to come across the robbery.

It's really irritating that these stupid aspects of the movie are actually core to the plot of it. You'd think these would be the first things to get sorted out. And it's not like it *couldn't* be sorted out - if Doc was his foster father, that would've given them more of a relationship for Doc to rely on, to use as emotional leverage, to be betrayed by in the end. If Bats had a specific skillset useful to the heist that couldn't have been done by anyone else, it would've made him an asset despite his instability. It'd have to be a ridiculously rare or useful skillset to warrant not shooting him on the spot after he took out the arms dealer, but it would've made way more sense than the literal-nothing explanation the movie currently gives.

It's still a good movie, but it should've been better.",0

And for most of the rest of the movie, she was stuck, unable to reveal what was on her mind.

So I think the lack of “range” was the correct way to play Billi.  If Billi knew what to do, she would have felt more free to express herself.  But everything was uncomfortable, even not being able to recognize her grandma’s town that was now a city, so she withdrew, and hid her emotions.",0

Even with the great cast and acting, the script did not make me care for the events in the movie. The drama was good, but it was a long slow burn with little satisfaction of the ending. 
Cinematography was really good at times, doing interesting perspectives and using fisheye/wide lenses to create more unique feeling, but then it would have a quick pan every once in a while that would make me dizzy. The classical music was selected well and appropriate for the time, but there was one piece that they composed for this that had the same octave played by a violin for probably two minutes straight that was so boring yet annoying that it distracted me from the events of the movie then.

Bhaer is never going to be a hearthrob but in the context of when he appears he's like the one shining warm point in Jo's life, the one comfort she has. She can never be sad or melancholy around him. Of course we get the signs of things to come when she sneaks into his room to darn his damn socks and sew his buttons (the book really does come all over conventional gender roles AND religion towards the end). Little Women spends a lot of time on Bhaer, and while it's never, ""Gee, I wish there were more men like Bhaer around today!"" he is very clearly the one refuge in her life as her world constricts, gets bleaker and more depressing. He lightens the mood, he's seldom melancholy, he's a positive thinker always moving forward, and he opens up the world of classical literature to Jo in a way it's never been shown to her before.  He's also very family oriented and family-supportive (his nephews).

A lot of the movie was true to the real world deaf community, a lot of them do view deafness as something that doesn’t need to be fixed and there are parts of the community who are very against cochlear implants, but most won’t shun people who do get cochlear implants. 


I’m not a candidate for cochlear because the auditory nerves between my cochlea and my brain are destroyed, so stimulating the cochlea wouldn’t work. Instead, I am a candidate for Auditory Brainstem Implants, which are similar to cochlear, only about twice as expensive, the surgery is much more dangerous, and the sound quality sucks much more than cochlear. Even if it’s nothing like the hearing I had before, I’d jumó on the opportunity to get an ABI immediately if presented with one. I don’t get the part of the community that’s so against fixing deafness. Yes, you can be proud to be deaf and embrace it, but I think we can all agree it’s a pain in the ass when interacting with the hearing world, and I’d just much rather have whatever tiny little sense of hearing an ABI would give me than stay completely shut out of the hearing world forever.",1

Outside of that, I do wish there was some footage of the actual fighting as much of what we get is pre or post fighting.  I understand why it's not in there and they did a great job storyboarding it out using actual drawings from back then.  At the end of the movie, I found myself wanting more.

The original script was even in English and was later translated to Korean.

But anyways, even though it does technically make sense for a film to be a “foreign-language film” if the most common language isn’t English, is this a useful categorization? I don’t think Minari (or Inglorious Basterds) would have been as effective if the characters had all spoken English. But, because Minari chose to tell a realistic story, it was punished - none of the actors were eligible for awards, and the movie wasn’t eligible for other main categories.

She simply accepted her new reality and along the way and picked up the tools to deal with that new reality the same way she picked up spare tires and can openers and glued together broken plates. 

She was busy making do and fixing stuff and making new friends and living her new life. I don't think she wallowed in whether that change was depressing or not. In fact, she specifically rejected the old comfort of a home and a family.  Instead, she chose to continue along her path as a nomad.

That's a great point: Sometimes, saying ""no"" is more about yourself than whomever is being told ""no.""

I've never cried so hard and for so long in any movie, and it's largely because there's so much in this movie that resonated with me and I could relate to.

Yeah, both Harper and Abby had good reasons behind their choices. It's just unfortunate that the choices weren't compatible. That's how life is and maturity can be measured by how one deals with challenge—loss and  misfortunes included—and thereby how one adapts; do you face and accept reality or do you deny and evade it?

I separated from my spouse in 2016, and had to move back home to the States with our then nearly 2 yo daughter from France. This movie mirrors so many of the moments I lived. The painful task of doing what you have to do to save your sanity... to go back home to fight for yourself and your light again, while also knowingly hurting the person that you have given your all to for years prior... Feeling so incredibly victimized and also so incredibly selfish. All the nasty fights where you say viscous things you regret instantly and wonder ""who is this person?"" about both yourself and your spouse... holding each other when you cry about it all, even though your feelings haven't changed. The ways in which you have to take a stance against them in order to protect yourself.... and the ways in which you try to be loving and helpful during the awful process, because it's just what you are used to doing -- supporting your spouse...  I'll never forget my spouse helping us pack and driving us to the airport and us saying our goodbyes... turning around to see if he was still there when I was in the security line and seeing that he had walked away.... and moving ahead in tears on to the next chapter of my life. It will forever be one of the most painful and yet pivotal moments of my life.

I loved the way the film ended -- it is so real for me. My spouse also ended up relocating here after resisting the move for about a year. I still have a lot of unresolved guilt about him having to leave his country, and all the times I know he's been miserable because of it. But that is how life is and I think it is what the film illustrates so masterfully. Beneath all of the complicated decisions, and the tangled web of consequences they weave, there is still so much love and so much worth protecting left over from a union that really just transitioned to something else other than a marriage. My ex will always be my partner as a parent, and I will love and support him until I die, and celebrate his accomplishments. I know he feels the same for me. I think this is what still remains between Nicole and Charlie at the end of the film. 

The only thing I didn't like about this film is that we have recently felt ready to get divorced officially, and now I am terrified of how our now amicable separation will be affected by the process... We also always say ""no lawyers when we get divorced, 50/50 custody, no fights..."" and I felt pretty confident that would be true until now!

Both performances were just so so well done. I saw so much of myself in both characters. Scarlett Johansson's monologue is one of the best things I've ever seen and when her face is literally RED with RAGE during their big fight, I was blown away by how she delivered that scene. Adam Driver's entire performance was transcendent. His moments of vulnerability made me weep a few times throughout the film. And the song! That scene is now in my top 5 favorite moments in a film of all time.",1

48915,"I was really intrigued by the premise and the first 2/3 of the movie was very suspenseful ... but for me it fizzled in the end.  They built up a lot of mystery that had little to no payoff.  

IMO there were 3 things they did wrong:

1. They killed off Jon Hamm way too soon.  They could have done a lot more with his character.

2.  I just did not like the dynamic of the film after Hemsworth's cult took everybody captive.  It took away the mystery of the film just to set up a quick action sequence to kill almost everyone off and resolve things.  I think the movie would have been better off if Hemsworth's character showed up to stalk/hunt Emily & Rose while all the other stuff is going on.

3.  There should have been more of a payoff or some sort of twist from at least one of the management, FBI, or tape plotlines.  ",0

One thing that was refreshing is that the evil actually “made mistakes” in the movie - a lot of times horror movies will have evil be all powerful and flawless, etc. The fact that these incredibly powerful witches still had discussions about what was the correct way to do things was something new to see. 

Also the score was incredible, along with the cinematography. Especially in the dancing scenes: instead of beautiful sweeping shots of the dancing, the almost documentary esque shots made for a very unsettling effect. 

The sound design was probably the most horrifying part of the movie - every bone crack sent me cringing into my seat.

Overall it was nothing amazing but nothing horrible, and nothing to watch over the animated version. This is the first film I've seen Emma Watson in since the Harry Potter series and I've got to say she was pretty bland. She seemed disinterested the whole time and unable to really give any emotion beyond the occasional smile or sad groan. I never felt myself feeling that it was Belle choosing to do something rather than Watson following the script. The only other complaint I have is that the CGI was pretty weak. The physical sets looked fantastic but when it was CGI it lost all of it's charm. This also caused problems with Beast, limiting most of his facial expressions to just his lips and a little bit of his brow.

As far as what I did like, I loved the banter between Gaston and LeFou. It's fun watching Gaston be a cocky jerk while LeFou responds with witty little lines. The Beast's dialog was also well done mostly when he and Belle were starting their friendship. Once he was allowed to express something other than anger I was really pulled in with his defeated tone. He seemed demoralized and tired because of the curse he'd received years ago, and watching him regain some humanity once Belle opened up with him was nice.

Kubo and the town love him back to life by giving him a story. The eye is his, at least partial, ability to see, and have life, and eventually move on. 

This is what storytelling is, its what it does by retroactively giving meaning to the past. Loss becomes gain. When you fall in love for example, every meaningless, painful and chaotic event is suddenly understood as leading to this very moment. One might even become grateful for any suffering that was truly painful in the past, as now, retroactively necessary and needed. Is this a lie? 

Perhaps the past changed when instead of ending our enemy (which can only be repeated endlessly without resolution) we instead forgive them, which is really offering them and us a new way out, a new story that posits its own cause. Significance is always grasped retrospectively. ",0

29725,"A good friend of mine pointed something out immediately after the end that blew my mind and has been driving me crazy the more I think about it: ""The whole movie is a palindrome - everything is the same forwards and backwards""

So, we started going back through the plot to support his theory, and this is what we established so far.

\-Most obvious, the film begins and ends with Schofield asleep by the tree

\-Right after the opening scene, Blake and Schofield are introduced, just as Schofield meets the elder Blake brother just before the ending

\-On the way to meet General Erinmore, the two pass by casualties before winding through the maze of trenches, just as after the meeting with Colonel Mackenzie, Schofield winds through the trenches and out past casualties in triage

\-The meetings with Gen. Erinmore and Col. Mackenzie mirror each other and occur at near identical intervals

\-Blake and Schofield being horrified by the mangled bodies in no man's land but quickly regaining composure - Schofield struggling over the floating corpses in the river before finally breaking down and weeping

\-Schofield nearly suffocating in the rubble from the blast in the dugout, then escaping the collapsing tunnel with Blake = Schofield fleeing from the German soldiers, jumping into and nearly drowning in the river

\-The cherry blossoms in the orchard = the cherry blossoms in the river

\-The German pilot stabbing and killing Blake while Schofield was retrieving water at the farm = Schofield killing the German sentry while his companion was drinking and preoccupied in the town

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm certain there's loads more - some of the matches are major plot points while others are tiny details. We also couldn't come to a consensus where the exact ""center"" of the movie fell, but I'm sure it will be obvious upon watching it again.

4117,"Thank god there are people who realize this movie is complete trash. It is TECHNICALLY a masterpiece (the animation and art style were mindblowing), but the writing and characterization are actually some of the worst I've ever seen (and of course the dated memes are just painful, I cringed for sure.)

I really hated that there was zero at stake. One second the family is scared of being attacked by robots, the next second the mom is a superhuman ninja that can defeat multiple super-robots? Because of the power of Momness? How can I get invested in something where there are guaranteed to be zero consequences for anything because the family can turn from normal to essentially invincible whenever it's convenient? Literally every scene is designed not to advance the story or characters, but to pack in as many bottom of the barrel cheesy jokes they could think of in the writer's room.

I also hate Gravity Falls, it is so god damn obnoxious compared with beautiful animated shows that actually respect their audience like Adventure time, Hilda, Over the Garden Wall, INTO THE SPIDERVERSE. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was also 100x better than this. I honestly think Mike Rianda just got lucky that some people think yelling and random memes and mid 2000s era anti-humour humour is funny. Something is SERIOUSLY off with the jokes and comedic timing in this movie, they played as so cheesy and predictable to me. The other reason I found it tough to laugh at anything was because te characters were so inconsistent. I did not understand what the little brother's personality was pretty much at all, but same goes for all of them to a certain extent.

Beck Bennet and Fred Armisen were funny with their voice acting. I mean all the actors did what they could, generally.

13560,"I'm not sure if they did a great job of addressing that but the movie definitely tried to show he tried to keep the pressure from being too much. Like when he takes them out of the tournaments it's partly because he doesn't want them to feel too much pressure and burn out. And again when Venus wants to join the tournament later on, and he changes his mind because he sees what that kind of pressure at that age did to Caprioti. 

But also to your point about ""what it takes to be great,"" I think that the movie also tried to show that they were just more capable of handling that kind of pressure. That they were ""special"" so they could handle more pressure than other people.

Overall I definitely think the movie definitely toes the line about whether he was too hard on them. Like that since it did work out so well he just knew what his daughters could handle better than other people. For most people all the pressure he put them under definitely would be too much to subject a child to (which is why that lady who called the cops isn't entirely the bad guy I think), but we know in the end he was right so maybe he just saw something others didn't.

76229,"I might argue that the grandfather ends up as one of the most developed characters because we end up with nearly every other character's opinion of him (and with each of these, we get reflections of the sphere of his character.)  In a way, the entire movie is developing the character of The Moon King as the other characters struggle with the varying perspectives of humanity. The movie ends up as a meditation on the concept of finality and its relationship with the infinite, with these being characterized through the human qualities of love, acceptance, passage, and memory. 

With that in mind, The Moon King is a character that I didn't feel I needed more introduction to because I already recognize him, he's me. He's a part of me. The part of me that recoils from my own humanity and sits and denies the truths of being human. Who would rather never love than experience losing love, who would rather never live in exchange for never having to die.

When I saw it (earlier tonight) I felt that this was pretty in line with the sort of questions and conflicts that the rest of the characters were dealing with throughout the story. I guess that could just be my own experience, however. ",0

The film is not about COVID. It’s not about what *could* happen.

75380,"My viewing experience for Finding Dory...

I often worry about children being too rambunctious in the movie theater, but it makes me so mad when it's the adults that ruin the movie.

This woman who sat next to us yelled ""AWWW!"" and banged her hands together causing her hard plastic bracelets to click during every sentimental scene, effectively taking away any emotional impact. She also gasped and screamed ""ohhh boy!"" or ""uh oh!"" during every part that was even slightly suspenseful or tense.

She would also periodically yell out random objects that the characters were using. You know, like when one of the characters simply picked up a coffee mug she yelled ""Oh, a coffee mug!""

During parts of the movies where characters learned lessons or developed at all, she would weirdly agree with what was happening. She would bob her head furiously saying things like ""Uh! That is so true! Just be yourself!""

I would finally like to point out that this woman was not alone. She was a grandmother who was with two other adults and 3 small children. The children sat quietly for the entire two hours. Literally, did not hear a single word from them.

To this woman, I would just like to say thank you because now I will always have this terrible memory of seeing a movie that I've have waited for over 13 years to see. Hopefully, someday, we'll be lucky enough to be just like Dory and forget this whole thing happened.

50901,"Ok this is gonna be personal but it's the only thing that's ever made me reflect on my Middle School years in a rational way so..

Everyone talks about surviving Middle School. They don't talk about how much it changes you. I was a completely different person from 5th grade to 8th grade. (Though in some ways, that was because I refused to change enough.)

By 7th grade I was literally leaning against the sides of hallways when I walked alone in school, like some weird, primal instinct. I didn't do this consciously. All the self-confidence had left me. By 8th grade, I was moving my chair close to the teacher's desk when we had to do silent reading because it was the least embarrassing option, when compared to sitting at a table with kids who wouldn't give me a second glance.

And though I didn't go as far as Kayla in terms of trying to reinvent myself, I related to so many things... making plans in spiral notebooks to get my friends back together. Trying to leave myself positive messages. Feeling like I suddenly had all the confidence I had lost when someone I admired talked to me.

I graduated High School in 2016, and didn't get my first camera phone until a year before that, so the social media stuff wasn't as relevant to me. (I loved that scene at the mall where they talked about this. It's so important.) But there were kids with iPhones as early as 2010, in 6th grade. In my 8th grade class, a kid was expelled (iirc) for soliciting nudes, and having some connection to storing or receiving them on his school laptop. It was then that I told myself, *I don't want to be popular anymore. It's not worth it, it's not worth it.*

I'm getting really personal here lol, but I don't have people to discuss this movie with. I am so so glad it exists.

Also, this is the most relatable portrayal of anxiety I've ever seen. When she was talking about how it was like the feeling of waiting to ride a roller coaster without being able to ride a roller coaster... that's the **best** way I've ever seen it described because it shows what anxiety does to you.

I think the witch wasn't necessarily a ghost (because one could argue that there aren't any real ghost in the traditional sense of the movie) but rather a manifestation of  his inability to face what he has done. It's important to say that the ghost never even try to do harm to Rial because she is still dealing with the pain through the beginning of the movie, while she maybe in denial about aspects of what happened, she doesn't deny what happened. 

This is very much against Bol throughout the movie. He forgets about ""his daughter"" and immerses himself within his new surrounding, housing himself within and keeping their past out. The ghost continue to get stronger and force him to break down the walls of his own house, until he has nothing left but to confront his past and summons the witch, resigning to kill himself. This might be reaching, but I feel like the witch 'getting under his skin' has some representation for the burying of his memories and feelings. His wife saves him from himself, she doesn't kill the ghost as much as she helps him to start to heal and only then can the two of them be happy, with the ""ghosts"" of the people they left behind always with them, but they try to make a good life for themselves.

But again, this is just my interpretation of the film.",0

At that point, any sense of nuance or restraint went completely out the window and it just became a heavy-handed melodrama that was layered on too thick. It felt like the plot of an anime written for teenagers, the characterization of the driver herself felt like an anime stereotype - brooding, aloof, damaged girl that shows zero emotion until the very end. Multiple personality disorder is actually very rare, but it is overused as a cliched plot device.

Visually though, I thought the film was absolutely gorgeous. The framing, the colors, the lighting, everything was a feast for the eyes.

It's worth a watch, but definitely did not need to be 3 hours long. The dialogue was also very exposition-y, like the very literal title, everything gets spelled out.

Furthermore, even after he moved back to the East coast, Teddy’s “cowboy” past became an important part of his persona, to the extent that it was one of the things he was most well known for.

Then when her van broke down she didn’t have $2400 to fix it.  She was in severe poverty and living with her sister permanently in my mind was never a real option - most siblings are not going to just move in and disrupt someone else’s life like that.  Fern didn’t want to be infantilized like that.  So she had a crappy van and no money... and somehow she isn’t poor enough for you?

14921,"I have clearly been watching too many insane shows and movies, because this is what I thought was happening for about the first half hour (keep in mind, I went into this film cold, no previews, no movie reviews, no idea what even the basic story was):

In the first scene, we don't know yet that Hopkins ISN'T in his own flat. It also isn't entirely clear yet if he's delusional/suffering from an affliction, or if rather he's just your typical stubborn, temperamental elderly man who refuses any help, even from his children. AND he's kind of an asshole to Anne in this scene (cold at first, then passive aggressive/manipulative), and REALLY cruel to her in the scene with Laura (calling her stupid, comparing her unfavorably with her sister, etc.)...

With all that, my impression would be that it turns out he is NOT delusional, but rather he's just a bad father who manipulates Anne, controls her life, belittles and insults her, destroys her relationships, etc...and so as revenge, because he's already not QUITE with it due to old age, Anne plays a huge, elaborate trick on him to make him THINK he's totally delusional and force him into a home. I especially thought this after I hit pause on Amazon Prime and saw that Olivia Williams' and  Mark Gattis' characters are called ""The Woman"" and ""The Man."" I thought: Ah, they are playing ACTORS, strangers hired by Anne to pretend to BE Anne and her husband or ex-husband , say things to Anthony Hopkins that they then UN-say in the next scene; have them disappear randomly so that he appears crazy for having seen them; mention food is on the table and then deny they ever said it and remove the food; feign confusion when he mentions anything he has heard them say, etc. 

Then I thought that Laura, too, was hired by Anne to pose as a caretaker (since Anthony has presumably fired every caretaker in the past, to Anne's unending exasperation), and that she'd engage in a battle of wills with Anthony until he's finally defeated and convinced he NEEDS to enter the home. 

Again, it was Hopkins being so mean to Anne, and her obvious hurt from it, that made me think these machinations were in play. It was only after they started making his character increasingly befuddled/helpless, and especially after they demonstrated that, cruel as Anthony can be, Anne's ex is far worse, that I started putting the pieces together.

It's a great, clever, unsettling movie, with a great conceit, but part of me wishes it WAS that fucked up. Sort of like this Martin McDonagh play I love called  *The Beauty Queen of Leenane,* where this unmarried 40-something woman is caring for her impossible insufferable mother (who has our sympathy because of her affliction but we can see how difficult it would be to care for her). The movie flirts with some of those complexities but doesn't go all out which is why I found the ending, heartbreaking as it was, a little maudlin/pitying for my tastes.

And on one level, Luca is the same for Luca and Alberto. Guilia and/or school represent these longer term desires for Luca, while Alberto is more concerned with extending this perfect summer. On another level, you can pretty easily swap those out for a romantic relationship to explain some of the emotional tension, but it's neither necessary nor explicit.",0
62216,"[As soon as Xavier got stabbed I was convinced he was going to wake up and it would all have been a dream, that type of fake-out has been done so many times. When the movie kept going I was genuinely fully shocked, they did a really good job at keeping the X-24 thing hidden which I guess is easier because they didn't have to cast someone new and then have people speculating and guessing it. Saying that though I think it would have worked a lot better with Daken than Jackman vs. Jackman, obviously they're keeping him open as an option for future films and so wouldn't have allowed him to be used, although the symbolism of Logan fighting himself is obviously powerful so maybe I'm completely wrong.](#spoiler)

I still can't imagine how got the stuff so fast unless he was like Herbert Armstrong or Neill Cream and just carried that shit around in his luggage to hand out to people as he chose.

11200,"I definitely had fun watching Nobody but there are some caveats.  First of all, it is straight up a John Wick copycat (yes, I'm aware it's the same writer), so it's mostly predictable apart from the occasional small deviation from the formula. I would have appreciated more creativity instead of just mostly doing what we've seen before. I was half expecting Wick to show up at the end like Nick Fury in Iron Man. 

Second, while I think there was mostly a good balanced between silly and serious aspects, I think it occasionally went just a bit too far and became straight up goofy. Like the scene with Christopher Lloyd in the retirement home taking out the two goons, to me that's a perfect balance - campy but not completely over the top. But then at the end when he's walking around with 19 shotguns and killing guys left and right, it's goofy. Also there's not a ton of tension in that scene since most of the bad guys just sort of run into frame to die, usually they don't even have their guns up. 

Third, while I do think the shorter runtime worked in the movies favour, I kind of wish the assault on the Russian mob bank or whatever was a full scene. I'm sure it was a budget thing to turn that into a montage instead though. 

Basically this is John Wick: Bob Odenkirk Edition, except they start the humour at John Wick 3 level. I'd give it a 7.5/10, this will be the perfect streaming movie when it eventually gets there (silly move to make this theatres only right now but whatever).",0

The fake ""buying shit to build the facade of a nice home"" is totally something that happens. Also, My heart died a little when the kid said ""I don't want to go out again for halloween,"" but Charlie made him do it anyway because it was what he wanted, instead of the fact that Henry was already tired and probably wasn't up for going out a second time.

It's nice that now there exists a mainstream lesbian rom-com, but it could've been better.

To me the whole theme of this movie is taking sexuality versus sharing it; self versus selfless. Strickland just takes sexuality, his ideal woman is Elisa because she can’t talk while his dick is inside her, basically the ultimate form of selfish sexuality. Meanwhile Fishman at very least respects Elisa for herself, and cares for her on an emotional level.

I think this also relates to the way green pops up over and over, notably in comparison between Strickland’s lime candies and Giles’ fridge full of key lime pie. As Strickland notes he consumes the candies based on his own needs while Jenkins selflessly eats the pies despite them being apparently garbage because he’s seeking a bigger connection with the pie shop owner.

28771,"In my opinion... this movie was really not good.

And it could've been great! They had all the right ingredients (actors, money etc.) But Greta Gerwig dropped the ball on this. Barely any time was given to flesh out the main characters. Meg was quite bland, TIMOTHEE AS LAURIE WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED AND GIVEN NOTHING TO WORK WITH. Marmee was made a one-dimensional character. MR. MARCH, WHO IS A CENTRAL PART OF THE STORY WAS GIVEN ONE SCENE and it was completely unbelievable when everyone acted all excited to see him after he came back FROM WAR because the girls barely talking about him in scenes prior.  
There was no sense of or atmosphere of their town as well. Concord (I believe?) is a charming place and a character of its own and there were barely any shots showing A TOWN

And don't even get me started on the terrible inaccuracy of the outfits and hair. If you're going to set a story in the Civil War era, you need to dress the characters historically. Otherwise, it takes you completely out of the story. I swear, all four sisters were wearing dresses from different time periods or modern interpretations of dresses from the 1860s.  
Also, I understand they were all progressive for their time but the scene in Laurie's grandfather's house where the sisters all squabble and yell over each and Marmee just goes ""My girls have a mind of their own"". Well...  
1. Even in modern times, teenage girls would not yell at each other in a stranger's home they just met. I know it was meant to show how close they were and ""sisterly"" but it was over the top and unrealistic, especially when you consider the time period.  
2. It did nothing to show us who the characters were. And was annoying.  
3. Real Marmee would've told those girls to be polite and shut up.

Good parts:  
There were a few good monologues from Jo. I like the one in the attic with Marmee.  
Amy was great. But her romance to Laurie was not believable because THEY DIDN'T GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO SHOW THE CHARACTER OF LAURIE

I just don't think the switching up of the chronology worked in this movie's favor. There was really no reason to do it except that it made this version of Little Women ""different"". But because of it, emotional investment in the characters and character development was completely lost. It was too ambitious for a two hour movie. Maybe it could've worked if it was a short series (like the much better 2017 version of Little Women. Seriously check it out, it's amazing!).",1

60336,"Forget the gunfighting, just the way that he blocked out scenes and action in general.

Something I once heard was that what makes gunfights interesting isn't necessarily what the character is doing or how ""badass"" it is or whatever, but how you utilize the space in which the scene is taking place. 

So, if you have to people shooting at each other from behind cars, what is more interesting than both people using the cars as cover and just trading back and forth? Maybe using the mirrors to spot each other out, maybe shooting directly through the windows, maybe shooting underneath by the tires, etc. These are just spitball ideas but you get the point.

And this movie took that idea to another level not only with gunfights but every choreographed scene in the film.

""What's an interesting way of sending someone on a coffee run?""

""What's an interesting way of having someone run from the police?""

""How does a getaway driver elude the police?""

That last example is something I have to wonder whether or not Wright was playing on, because in that sense the entire movie felt like a car chase. Not like Mad Max, but how does a getaway driver actually elude the police? He (Wright) uses the environment and creativity to take routes and pull manuevers that his followers aren't expecting.

Just like Baby using public park tables to cut across an open space and get to a pathway with higher elevation. Just like he goes down an ""up"" escalator and then jumps across to the other side and goes down the ""down"" one. Just like how there is a foreshadowing in the diner when the cop goes through the doors that lead to the bathroom and when we turn back to it expecting the cop, it's just another waitress. And then when we turn back again expecting Buddy to pull his gun, it's actually Baby who's pulled a gun on Buddy.

52137,"A few thoughts on this extremely compelling movie.  Can't get it out of my head.

1.  I suspect that the psychologist rationalized the study something like ""they'll never know what they are missing (by not growing up with their twins/siblings), and we'll gain insight into \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (whatever they were studying).""  Obviously morally wrong to most people, but consistent with his (the psychologist's) own self-interest.   This flaw in human nature is understudied and ripe for development.  
2. If I were jewish, adopted, and grew up within 150 miles of NYC, I'd be thinking about whether people came to my house and filmed/tested me on a periodic basis.
3. My take on the nature/nurture question is that the nature part (all were wrestlers, smoked, had great smiles, etc.) was somewhat generic, maybe on the superficial side.   Listening to their wives and why they liked one or the other, listening to the triplets themselves, listening to the discussions about why Eddy committed suicide, reveals that they were clearly different personalities.  That's only one dimension of each one's uniqueness.  One other key aspect is the nurturing aspect of love.  We don't have enough data to say too much conclusively, but I came away with a stronger conviction than ever that it's critical to love your people with all your heart.   That doesn't mean discipline should or shouldn't be part of the equation.
4. Even identical twins and triplets brought up by the same parents have different personalities, different ways of addressing challenges in their lives, and different ways of expressing and receiving love.   So it's hard to believe the motivation behind the study was nature/parenting related nurture alone because even when circumstances are such that the children should develop close to identically if it's possible at all, they don't.   
5. Perhaps the reason why we haven't seen a study report is that it takes a lifetime (and maybe more!) to understand the full ramifications of the different upbringings.   At one point the psychologist probably became too old to continue, the study participants became to old and self aware to participate in these tests and observations without being brought in to what was going on.  And of course when the triplets found each other, it would have disturbed any findings from then on anyway.   
6. One other consideration is that the study organizers may at one point have become aware of their own potential liability and decided to fade away quietly.",0

25584,"Okay I went into this expecting it to be really bad and was very pleasantly surprised. It would actually be among my top holiday movies if it weren't for all the b.s. that it pulls in the last twenty minutes or so:

- Harper was forgiven *much* too easily after spending about 95 per cent of the movie being absolutely thoughtless and borderline cruel to the woman she supposedly loves, starting with putting her in that horrible situation in the first place. You can easily feel sorry for her (as a child of narcissistic parents, I know all too well the deeply-ingrained feeling that keeping them happy has to be your number-one focus at the cost of everything else) but it would have been better character development to have Abby leave her in the end (and get together with Riley, imo).

- Harper's sister was also forgiven too easily for forcing her out of the closet.

- After the brilliant conversation between Abby and John about the reality of coming out to your parents, having Harper's parents' homophobia magically cured to the point of them suddenly being written as different people felt *too* fairytale-y. Trying to redeem her mother who's been a monster the whole time by having her be like 'Oh I actually hate flowers and want to learn karate'? And the dad being like 'wow forget my lifelong ambition to become mayor, I've just realised my family is more important' felt right out of a bad 90s children's movie.

- Jane's realisation of 'I deserve better' came out of absolutley nowhere.

Ultimately I guess I wanted to see a relatable ending where the sisters bonded and realised they are valid and don't need the approval of their abusive parents, and waving a magic wand to have them turn into great parents on the spot instead was a bit disappointing.

We see the two stars willing to take chances to follow their dreams but what we see through out is that they can never seem to find a way to be happy together while also being happy with themselves. So when the end rolls around and we see [that they have both achieved the dream they set out to live and they are apart the audience suddenly is filled with a sadness. This is achieved because the story focused on what we leave behind when we follow our dreams. Pursuing your passion means making sacrifices.

As someone who has started their career and felt feelings of disappointment that it's not making me suddenly feel complete like I thought it would, I loved the message about how we don't have innate callings, and that living itself is the spark of life.

There's not much to not like about this. It's an extremely charming film.

Amazing chemistry between Mortensen and Ali, with some truly great performances as well between the both of them. Forgot how good of an actor Mortensen is and this may be one of my favourite characters he's played. I couldn't tell you who won performance wise though, they're both great.

It's actually a genuinely funny movie too, which shouldn't be that big of a surprise considering it's directed by Peter Farrelly. It doesn't overdo the funny though, it still manages to be extremely topical and hit some very poignant and dramatic moments throughout.

Really, my biggest complaint is that maybe it's TOO competent. It's very crowd pleasing and it panders a bit. It's a little predictable. It does all the right things right on the nose. Crowds will love this movie, I'd say the majority of people will really enjoy it... Well unless you're from the Southern United States... It's a bit of a 'fuck you' to Ya'll.

Still, any complaint I have is overshadowed by the great chemistry between the two leads, and the sheer amount of charm that comes out of this film.

The hearing loss was addressed subtly in the film to reflect Jacks fear of it.

He lied to Ally about it, saying it went away while he was young and he can only truthfully talk about it while in rehab when he gets sober. He drove his brother away because he was the only person pushing him to address the issue. Seeing his hearing get worse throughout the film was heartbreaking. The rest of it was too, I just think it was kept subtle for a reason. He was running from it.

OK, the purple-thing is terrible and means end of the world, but we only see it twice in the movie? Its threat is mostly explained then shown. There's a lot of exposition throughout the movie that was unnecessary.

Also, there's a lot of unanswered question. Why are the statues positioned like that? Why some statues are not? Why does Sisu is revived when the dragons come back? Also, the main message of ''we have to trust each other'' is pretty much undermined by the multiple occasions where it's proven that WE SHOULDN'T.

I think that he was simultaneously acting on his latent attraction to Peter while trying to ""steal"" him from Rose in the same way that Rose ""stole"" his brother from him.

Even his relationship with his brother smacks of creeping incest at worst and possessiveness at best—he never crosses the line, but he hits the boundaries frequently, from visiting him in the bath to taking offense when his brother expresses interest in doing anything that doesn't directly involve Phil, to the fury when he takes a wife.",1

The characters were certainly more glossy and Hollywood than their real-life counterparts. Ideologically speaking too, as you say.

Personally, I felt that being less dogmatic in its representation of The Chicago Eight and espousing any one voice as 'the correct one' helped convey the message of the film. Maybe the choice to try and make Shultz sympathetic in the end did a feel a little forced and schlocky, but would that many people have really sat out on the honouring of dead teenage soldiers? (In a courtroom? Quite possibly.) That said, I didn't find Hoffman to be 'less agreeable' than Hayden, nor any of the main eight any more-or-less sensible than the rest. Perhaps others would feel more passionately opposed to one over the other, though I fear those viewers may have their own biases and missed the point somewhat, in a similar vein to someone who watches and roots for the prosecutors.

Of course, that's all relative to what you think the film's ultimate message is. I can't say I share your sentiment on the left and centre being 'bitter enemies', but I suppose our understanding of that point hinges on our own selective definitions of each term.  
For example, I'm no great fan of neoliberalism or communism. I say I'm a centrist in so much as I'm very wary about factional politics and radicals, which is not to say I always disagree with them. I also said it at the end as a funny little joke.",1

27246,"> “The unexamined life is not worth living”

This cliched Socrates translation (the motto of my high school) helped frame how I see the character of Frank Sheeran. Personally, I found THE IRISHMAN to be profoundly moving. Any epic this broad will speak differently to each viewer, so I’ll just articulate my own narrow reading–the film as an exploration of how those who do not interrogate their own actions will live a meaningless life. 

Frank Sheeran is incapable of meaningful introspection.

He attempts self *reflection* (indeed, that structures the movie), but he struggles to interrogate his own narrative. Frank is a shockingly passive participant (both as an aged storyteller, and as a mob foot soldier), and his thoughtless life becomes a tragic embodiment of the Socrates quote.

Frank represents the *banality* of evil, a consistently undermotivated and passive foot soldier. In the moment, Frank can tell himself comfortable justifications–he’s working to better his family, his friends, the union, and himself. Yet, as these motivations are exposed as hollow, we’re confronted with a sobering alternative. What if Frank’s central failure was not greed or cruelty, but rather, an inability to interrogate his own choices? What if Frank was a passenger in his own narrative, unable to question whether there was another way?

This idea is at its most poignant and literal in Frank's flashback to war. He stands guard with his gun as the prisoners dig their own graves, musing “I always wondered why they kept digging”. He is painfully unaware of the irony, and we will watch Frank dig his *own* grave for the next three hours. As a hitman, Frank holds the gun, so he blithely assumes that he must be the soldier, but we see him as the prisoner with a shovel (the loss of individual agency in the mob collective is a Scorsese staple). The final act provides us with a biting callback to this scene when Frank goes to the morgue to purchase his own coffin (the expression “digging your own grave” made literal).

The reasons for Frank’s lack of introspection are both personal and societal. Toxic masculinity is a pervasive theme in Scorsese’s filmography, and Frank takes that emotional repression to the extreme. Hoffa grumbles that Frank never shares how he feels, but the problem lies not in his refusal to share, but in his refusal to allow himself to feel in the first place. Even the impoverished language of the mobsters is crafted to inhibit meaningful dialogue, with each new order provided as a euphemism. The most devastating of these is when Russell seals Hoffa’s fate (and with it, Frank’s), with the chilling line *“It's what it is”*. Could the euphemism be any more apt? Frank’s life “is what it is” *because* Frank never questions whether it could be anything different.

Frank’s refusal to confront his own self cannot save him from judgment. Peggy’s eyes provide a chilling visual motif, operating as Frank’s conscience, and those maturing eyes eventually pierce to the heart of who her father truly is. I’ve seen some argue that Anna Paquin’s role is undermined by her limited line count, but her silence is more powerfully damning than words could ever be. When she does speak, it is the signature line of the climax, a charged and desperate **“Why?”**. De Niro’s silent response is agonizing, and “Why?” is the enduring question that Frank has avoided confronting his entire life. Peggy’s follow-up statement (clarifying “Why… didn’t you call Jo?”) allows the plot to progress, but it’s that first question which we hear most clearly, and it will haunt Frank for the rest of his life. In his old age, Frank’s legacy is defined by the absence of these women who should have been his pride and joy.

In the heartbreaking final act, Frank attempts to atone for his “unexamined life” with a furious flurry of self reflection, yet it’s as inadequate as a study session the day after an exam. Introspection matters because it lets us make better decisions in the future, and with Frank’s fate sealed, these attempts are hollow. When Frank begs Delores to tell Peggy that he’s sorry, Delores angrily demands that he explain “For what?”. Once again, Frank has no good answer (although Delores is happy to fill in a few of the blanks, preemptively rebutting the claim that he did it to protect his family). In his final confession, Frank admits that he has no “remorse”, and I’m inclined to believe him. Of course he has regret (it consumes him), but true remorse requires substantive *reckoning* with your actions, which Frank still cannot do. How can you atone when you don’t understand your own agency? 

THE IRISHMAN is a somber, joyless epic, exploring the tragedy of a man’s wasted life. And yet, I don’t find it wholly bleak, because ultimately, *we are not Frank Sheeran*. The ambiguous final shot of the movie (Frank’s door left half open, a callback to his time with Hoffa), leaves us with a kernel of hope. I see this not as a statement about Frank (the camera draws away, leaving behind the man on his deathbed, his fate sealed); rather, it leaves the *audience* with the half open door, because our future remains yet unwritten.

Obviously, I was captivated by this movie, and this (far too long) post only scratches the surface.

Plus, if the scene was a delusion, it still leaves the question of where he got the gun then.

It all felt so phony and inauthentic. So many characters read like caricatures of what the writer figured a Middle American [insert occupation here] must be like. Sure, it's totally okay for a journalist to publicly speculate that Prominent Person A drove Prominent Person B to suicide. Sure, grown adults can publicly assault children in front of their school. Sure, small-town police officers always attempt to murder local businessmen in broad daylight and face no legal repercussions for it. These people are too folksy to press charges.

The handful of black characters seemed to exist as plot devices, helping out the good white folk, and being mistreated by the bad ones.

There's the issue of Mildred as a character. The tone of the movie seems to suggest that we should root for her, but I'm sorry, this woman is dangerous, not in a ""grrr momma bear"" way but in a criminally deranged way. By the end of the film she has committed multiple felonies and is considering committing more.

The Rockwell character's turn felt very sudden and unearned.

It also makes sense cause the song was prompted by Nina spending the night with Benny that night but they cut that out too. They added the Dreamers storyline so they had to make narrative sacrifices, unfortunately.

I've always loved the song but it wasn't super necessary in the narrative. Then once the song and conflict were out they didn't feel they needed the Mom character.

I get it, I enjoyed this movie, but Bats, Joseph and Darling were probably the only well fleshed out characters. Not that they were amazing but they didn't go off on some weird tangent that seemed completely out of place.  Bats had me nervous the whole time he was on screen.  Darling played loose and had a wild and free spirit attitude.  But Buddy's turn as the bad guy, I mean yes they explain the whole seeing red thing, But I felt like showing that could have helped me believe it more because prior to the diner scene, he was too nice to Baby and a little too carefree like Darling.  The other part that bothered me is that he all the sudden becomes this great shot after Darling dies and gets pretty methodical/tactical with his shooting but prior to that he is just running through huge open spaces with his back to 4-5 cops who for some reason are just running after rather than taking aim and shooting them.  I'm sure I'm being nit picky but it bugged me.

I'm sure people will point out to me that he's a former Wall Street guy, not a former marine or something.  All I can say is... exactly, he is a former Wall Street guy, and he shouldn't have gotten away from the cops that many times.  Don't get me wrong, I though Jon Hamm did a great job throughout this film but the last 1/3 just fell apart for me.

Kevin spacey was fantastic in the first 2/3's and it's not like his acting was bad in the last 1/3 but there was no motivation whatsoever for him to all the sudden be super nice guy/take a bullet for you.  I mean he threatens to kill him and his girlfriend if he doesn't do the job.  The turn just didn't work.

You've said enough about Debora so I don't feel the need to elaborate.  I felt it was acted well, but the bonding scene at the laundromat, while fine, didn't take me to the crazy in love that I think it was supposed to.

As for casting, I looked up her mother, father, nai nai. It's almost too good. These actors are seasoned. Been doing it for a while in their country.

My favorite parts: 

1. The foreshadowing at the funeral with the people. Annie mentioning how she doesn’t recognize them and that her mother had private interests. 

2. Annie seeing her mother’s apparition after discovering her cult books. 

3. Annie’s discussion of the mental illness in her family, specifically her mentioning that her brother thought her mother was “putting people inside him.” I thought this was very good characterization and spoke volumes about the trauma Annie had been put through. 

4. The post and the entire sequence where Charlie died. I felt SO uncomfortable and worked myself up. I had to tell myself it was fiction, just a movie. The sight of her decapitated head on the side of the road coupled with her mother’s screams absolutely gutted me, and I don’t think I’ll forget it. 

5. The entire sequence in the treehouse. Just absolutely so grim and creepy. Leaves you feeling like you’ve jolted awake from a nightmare. 

I really think this movie had great moments. The final act was mind-bending for me, but I plan on seeing it again and trying to make better sense of it. I almost wish they’d kept it more mental health oriented, because the hallucinations your own mind can conjure are endlessly terrifying without the whole cult member sequence. But I understand why they did that, and I do enjoy the ending.

18474,"The song Heloise listens to at the end is the song Marianne played for her on the harpsichord early on in the film. The Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice happens opposite to how you remember it - Orpheus specifically does look back, going against the deal he made with Hades to get his lover out of the underworld because he couldn't bear not seeing Eurydice any longer. Normally people put this down to the doubt he feels, as on the journey he cannot hear or turn back to see Eurydice so he doesn't know if she is following him out of the underworld, or they just put it down to him being impatient to see his lover. Heloise, however, suggests when they are reading the story that perhaps Eurydice told him to turn around giving him permission to make the 'poet's choice' to always hold onto his memory of Eurydice with one last look rather than the lover's choice to stay together forever. This is reflected in Marianne and Heloise's last moments together at the mansion when Heloise tells Marianne to turn around just as she is about to leave forever and Marianne sees her in Heloise in her wedding dress on the stairs before leaving forever.  

There are a couple interpretations therefore about Heloise's reaction at the symohony at the end. Either she didn't know that Marianne was there and was simply reacting to the music which Marianne had played for her (perhaps this is her first time hearing it properly and it brings back all her feelings about their relationship or maybe she listens frequently and this is how she always responds) or Heloise does know that Marianne is there but makes the so-called 'lover's choice' to not turn around. I personally prefer the former as I'm not sure what Heloise deciding not to acknowledge Marianne really says about their relationship.  

Maybe as you say she is in fact making the poet's choice by choosing only to remember Marianne. This is confusing though because choosing not to turn around is the opposite of what Orpheus does in the story but they both result in the 'poet's choice' but obviously the situation is different so perhaps that's explanation enough for this. Though this being confusing is why I'm inclined to think she does not know Marianne is there. Sorry this is waffly and probably confusing but I hope I helped you understand a little better or jogged your memory.",0

Also, in the same scene in the kitchen, it is interesting to see how lee is able to help his nephew calm down but he is unable to help him on any real emotional level because he himself is so numb he simply can't empathize.  But he truly wants to, he even goes so far to break open the bedroom door so the kid wasn't in there suffering alone.  Once he is in there he again can't comfort him but he does help the situation by being there.  Shows that lee really is a good guy.  Most interesting is the fact that lee in Boston is basically a guilt-wridden depressed human being who lives in that miserable little apartment where he must beat himself up constantly night after night.  He is walled up emotionally, walled up socially, walled up in real life.  But the second his nephew tries to do the same to himself, Lee breaks that door (barrier) down, and helps him.

62295,"I think that's one of the stronger points of the film that some people can just reflect on. As sad as it is, the ""villain,"" who was pretty much a product of the world's crimes against him and his family, wasn't really wrong, but he was still a threat. It really depends on how you look at him, though, because while he's certainly an antagonist, he's not entirely to blame. Still, the whole sad thing is that Logan's just struggling to get by as a limo driver of all jobs to get money to buy a boat and sail out to sea with his only two mutants that he can call a family. The way he struggles to help Xavier run away with him, even going as far as to fold and pack his wheelchair in the middle of danger, just emphasize somewhat of a father-son bond between the two, which we really didn't see. That dinner scene emphasized it. I guess after the ending, you realize it wasn't what you'd expect from a comic book superhero movie, at all. There's no saving the world; it's just a man trying to save what little family he has left while struggling with his past catching up to him. Getting a boat wasn't going to solve any of their problems, as Caliban stated in the beginning, but it's all Logan could do. In the end, we see that the heroes *did* kill the enemies, but the end is still unclear. Xavier died, pretty much all the mutants are dying out, Caliban sacrificed himself, and even Logan finally met his end. Arguably one of the strongest X-Men, he finally died, and it wasn't to change all humanity or really make the future better. All he did was save the one world that actually meant to him at death; Laura. While their future is unclear at his death, that's the end of his legacy. Logan did all he did up until the very end, and he can finally be at peace knowing he won't have to mourn for anyone, anymore, and that it's his turn to be mourned.",0

A lot of Spike Lee's trademarks are there such as dutch angles, the dolly shot, the fourth wall breaking/talking to the camera, the insertion of real footage, etc. So if you're a fan of his style, I think you can find something to like.

I feel like the movie could've been trimmed down a bit though. Some scenes IMO went on for far too long. Sometimes the stakes didn't feel high enough though. For example, [When Flip says he has a sick father in Dallas and not El Paso. A lot of the slip ups were explained away and kinda accepted with ease from the Klan members. This may have been how it played out in real life though?](#spoiler)

It was interesting it went with no score, too. It did have some really nice shots but I wouldn't say it had anything incredible in terms of cinematography.

56271,"I've seen Blade Runner 2049 twice now and there's definitely a lot to unpack. I haven't been able to get it out of my head. These are my thoughts. 

**SPOILERS**

To me, one of the most interesting themes explored in the film is the meaning of love. All the major characters view love differently and their perspectives are reflected by their actions.

* **For Ryan Gosling's character K, love means presence:** K's relationship with Joi is one of the most emotionally potent parts of the film. He simply wants the company. And he wants it to be available whenever he wants it. He can turn Joi on and off as he chooses and never asks anything of her besides her presence. He knows that after a period of her being turned off, he can turn her back on and she'll be there for him, unconditionally. It's that unconditional love that he's looking for, something humans often (though not always, unfortunately) get from their spouses and parents. He has Joi as a ""spouse"", and much of his arc in the film is devoted to his search for his ""parent."" This desire to feel special, to be loved, gives him purpose.

* **For Joi, love means giving someone what they want:** Joi's purpose is to indulge the desires of her companion. Her presence is meant to reinforce everything he wants to feel. She whispers into K's ears what he wants to believe. He wants to believe he's ""real,"" that he has a purpose beyond being a tool, and so she tells him that. He wants to feel normal and wants to express his love normally, so she calls over a tangible woman so that he can, uh, make love to her. She pushes him further into his fantasies, helping him truly believe he's more than just a replicant, that he was born and not manufactured, even if that's probably not something a replicant should believe. She doesn't necessarily give him what's best for him, only what he's looking for at any given time.

* **For Deckard, love means giving someone what they need:** Deckard plainly states that ""sometimes to love someone, you've got to be a stranger."" He doesn't allow himself to indulge his desire to see his child, because he knows that's not what's best for them. He has a pragmatic view of what love is, and he sets up a complex trail of misinformation and mystery to try and isolate his child's identity from the world, and to isolate himself. This is, of course, almost the polar opposite of K and Joi's ideal of love. Instead of trying to be there for his child at all times, he wants them isolated from him. It's his absence, and not his presence, that demonstrates his profound love for his child. (And, tragically, his child is literally isolated, all alone in a bubble.)

* **For Niander Wallace, love is a means to an end:** Wallace's concept of love is also pretty plainly presented. Love is more important to him than anything else even though he's drained it of its emotional foundation. I mean, he literally names his #1 replicant Luv. For him, Luv is a resource that does whatever he asks her to do. He also wants to manufacture love, both in the form of Joi and in the form of replicants that are capable of reproducing. He uses it as a weapon in the literal sense, with Luv acting as his enforcer. And he also uses it as a weapon in the metaphorical sense by showing Deckard a copy of the woman he loved to manipulate Deckard into revealing information about his child. Furthering this idea is the fact that he wants to find the child, the product of Deckard and Rachel's love, in order to dissect it and understand how he can create replicants capable of ""love"" that can create exponentially more children. For Wallace, love is the key to everything, which sounds romantic, but it's demystified. It is only a way for him to push forward his vision. (Haha, dude's physically blind AND blind to the meaning of love.)

I guess to summarize: Love is purpose and a way to dodge loneliness for K, it's indulgence for Joi, sacrifice for Deckard, and a commodity for Wallace.

I'm not sure I would go so far as to say that love is necessarily Blade Runner 2049's central theme, but it was the most interesting one to me because of how each character views it and how their views inform their actions in the film. It truly is a beautiful film and I think it's going to continue to stick in my mind.

What do you think about the themes of love in Blade Runner 2049?

40265,"Here's a thing - for a movie that was supposedly handled with ""kiddy gloves"" and had all its edges shaved off, it is almost confusingly powerful, which just might be thanks to the power of Queen music (according to some critics) but you need a certain level of filmmaking ingenuity to live up to the music you are presenting onscreen. This is one of rarest cases where i genuinely think most of the critics were biased when going into this movie because of the whole behind the scenes fiasco with sacha baron cohen, where it was reported heavily among the filmmaking community that he was taken off the project because the band wanted to sanitize the story, which is basically an open season invitation for critics to raise a fucking shitstorm against whatever movie they make. And I have to admit i was one of those people who initially opposed to even seeing the movie because of what happened with cohen. But when i saw it I was just shook, it is less of a movie that digs deep into the dark underbelly of Queen and Mercury (which is apparently what most critics wanted...i guess) but just a pure celebration of the life of Freddie Mercury, and the movie does exactly that incredibly well. We didnt need to see Freddie getting fucked in the ass in an underground sex dungeon covered in cocaine while a depressing music plays over it to get the point, in fact in hindsight i prefer the approach they went with this movie where they dont show the nitty gritty details of Freddie's debauchery to understand that he's going downhill, simple visual cues and Rami Malek's performance is enough to elicit an emotional response from the audience, and it is as powerful as any wolf-of-wallstreeted, R-rated, biographic movies ever made. If the critics wanted to see another The Doors style musical biopic, i get it, but the movie stands on its own very well even when you dont see the members of the Queen say fuck every ten seconds and drug fueled wild parties. Also the scene where Freddie walks away from Paul Panter is so fucking satisfying and well done, as is the live aid sequence.",1

Throughout the film, different characters that represent alienation are referenced -- Mabel from A Woman Under the Influence is one of them (all those blowing raspberries and odd mannerisms Lucy/Lucia takes on suddenly while discussing the film are based on how Gena Rowlands played the character in the film), so is Dr. John Nash from A Beautiful Mind (Jake's speech verbatim), and so is the character of Jud the Farmhand from Oklahoma, who sings the song The Lonely Room, which is the song Jake sings at the end. 

Jake expresses a lot of compassion for Mabel's character (who is a woman with a family who is a heavy drinker who eventually has a complete mental breakdown) and seems to identify with her (the same way he clearly identifies with the kids at the high school who get picked on). Whereas Lucy just spouts off a scathing review written by Kael because she's just an amalgamation of different traits he admires, Jake has true compassion for Mabel. He sees himself in her. It leads him into a bit of a soliloquy about the futility of life, how all the platitudes about how things work out in the end are garbage, the sorts of things a suicidal person would say, a person to whom life hasn't been very kind.

In Oklahoma, Jud as a character is alienated, creepy, and menacing, and his sexual fascination with Laurie (who we see played by a student earlier in the movie and we see the janitor watching, and who later taunts the janitor btw) was one of the first depictions of what we now call sexual harassment in popular media. He's basically what we'd now call an incel, but there's a part of you whose heart hurts for him. He's really lonely and just wants love and can't figure out what he's doing wrong, and I think the parallels that Kaufman draws between him and Jake are really interesting. It's especially interesting since there's another song in Oklahoma where Jud's romantic rival for Laurie's affections, Curly the handsome Cowhand, basically goes to Jud's lonely room and tries to convince him to kill himself because everyone would speak nicely of him if he did. I swear to God, it's called Pore Jud is Daid, it's super fucked up.

I get that people found the dream ballet confusing, but it was really a callback to Oklahoma and a lot of the musicals of that time, a lot of them had those sorts of dream ballets -- Carousel, Oklahoma, Fiddler on the Roof, Brigadoon. It's just another way of contrasting the ideal (the ballet) with the reality.

Additionally, Ralph Albert Blakelock, the painter we see referenced in the film, was a guy who was super troubled and dealt with intense depression that eventually manifested as full on schizophrenia, and spent a good deal of his life locked away in asylums...which of course is when his paintings started selling like hotcakes. Again -- alienation, mental illness, isolation. He also talks about David Foster Wallace's suicide and how the suicide basically eclipsed his writing.

There are a number of clues as to what's going on even if you didn't read the book (and admittedly I watched it twice and saw a lot on the second viewing). Jake's speech in the car about the hopelessness of life is one of the first clear clues that Jake and the janitor are the same person. Jake is also the young brunette in the ice cream shop, if you notice they have the same funky skin condition when he hands her the $10 bill. The two blondes who mock the janitor in the hallway also mock Jake. He refers to having been in the high school for ""such a long time."" In the beginning of the movie, we see the janitor in the farm house, alone eating cereal and watching TV (he clearly cared for his ailing parents until they passed and never had a family of his own.)  His uniforms are being washed in the basement when Lucy takes the nightgown down (and maybe that's why Jake doesn't want her to go down there.) 

The movie is a rumination before death by suicide about how it could have been for him. Each time he ruminates, he imagines Lucy/Lucia/Amy and she's a painter or a poet or a physicist or a film critic but the one thing she isn't is real.

54787,"/u/cebjmb asked why the doctor called Alma Mrs. Woodcock, and my reply became so long that I'm posting it as a comment instead. Anyway, a few thoughts on the doctor and just how much he represents, because he's one of those characters who seemed completely utilitarian at first glance and then turned out to be a lot more.

""Mrs. Woodcock"" says a ton about both the characters and the situation that they're in. Living together in the 1950s was really, really out of bounds -- people did it, but they had to be ready to brace for a LOT of blowback. It doesn't matter for Reynolds so much because he and Cyril have their own little fiefdom and no surviving family to disapprove; plus, even if their customers knew, they would probably be more flexible about it than they usually would be partly because hey, artists have a right to be a little unconventional, and also because if they want a Woodcock dress, they don't exactly have other options. Alma is more of a mystery, but she clearly has no family nearby and may have no family at all -- we hear about her mother but never see her, it's not even clear if she's alive. However, if her friends and old employers know that she's living with a man without being married, it's unlikely that they approve and it's likely that a few friends at least have dropped her. She's in a very vulnerable position. 

The doctor is the first character to come in who isn't living entirely in the walled garden which Reynolds and Cyril have built for themselves; he's not a girlfriend, an employee, or a client. He's in their house, but he really belongs to the outside, conventional world -- he's not subject to the rules of their house. He doesn't have to defer to Woodcock sensibilities in the hope of getting something out of them, whether it be a dress, a job, or love. When Reynolds tells him to fuck off, and he does, Reynolds really has no power over him; the doctor is fucking off purely out of politeness and consideration for the patient (and he still insists upon being called later if things change). 

The doctor almost certainly knows that Reynolds and Alma are not in fact married; for one thing, he's a client's nephew and moves in some of the same circles -- he undoubtedly knows something of Reynolds' reputation. For another, Alma has no wedding ring. Not everyone wears wedding rings, but combine that with Reynolds's rep and he's got a pretty good idea. By calling her ""Mrs. Woodcock"" when he probably knows she's no such thing, he is signalling that he respects her and recognizes her place in Reynolds's life. He's not obliged to do any such thing -- Cyril is Reynolds's closest family in a legal sense and if the doctor had ignored Alma entirely and insisted on speaking only to Cyril, that would have been completely expected. But in that scene, we can see how Reynolds's illness shifts the power from Cyril over to Alma. Cyril talks to the doctor, but the doctor talks not to her but to Alma -- and when he does, he uses the title which Alma does not yet have, but which, thanks to this illness, she soon will. ",1

This movie heavily drawn from Cuaron's memory. The Cuaron stand-in younger child mentions wanting to be a pilot, and that part is autobiographical. Young Alfonso initially wanted to be an astronaut/pilot. So in the same way the choice of movie (""Marooned"") wasn't a coincidence (Cuaron's early trips to the movie theater were enormously influential for him eventually becoming a director), I don't think the planes are just regular ambience. Cuaron is drawing from his memory, and as a child he dreamed of being a pilot, so those planes flying overhead were a staple of that memory (in a way that I would usually just tune out the ambient noise of a plane overhead).",1

The physical comedy is also great.

But also, the movie delivers the political situation with Stalin and the lists so perfectly, there were moments the film turned into something horrifying, a reflection of all the ugly things that were happening in Russia at the moment.

Still, I think the film is too unrealistic in how it portrays the lifestyle. It presents a lens that I just couldn’t “buy” into. I don’t think it clearly shows that it “isn’t a great lifestyle”. It shows drawbacks, but plays to the note that these drawbacks are “worth it”. 

I didn’t need clear conflict. But I did need to see more to make this more compelling. Her choice to stay in this lifestyle, to reject her sister and Dave’s invitations, would be much more meaningful if we saw how challenging this actually was. It would show that DESPITE the difficulties, her choice was rooted in something profound. 

Throughout the whole movie, I don’t think she meets a single person who isn’t kind or nice. How realistic is this? I can think of one character, the 5 second appearance of the guy telling her she can’t park there. Everyone else? Kind, even if misguided a little. The woman saying it’s cold and there’s a shelter (you can sleep here though! Comes from a place of kindness). The woman in Walmart, not understanding the lifestyle, but offering to let a non relative to stay with her. Dave’s family, letting a pretty much complete stranger just live on their farm. 

This lifestyle would be so much harder than shitting in a bucket. It would be nights of no food. It would be constant stress about finding employment. It would be problems of health, etc. the only trouble she ever TRULY faces, when her van breaks down? I’ll just have my sister give me 3k in cash. 

I thought the movie was beautifully done, but it has a certain shallowness for me. It’s not honest to what that lifestyle would be, which wouldn’t just be “kind understanding Americans”, and “occasional difficulties”. It would be much, much, harder, which if shown, would make her decision to continue it that much more meaningful.",1

Sure their predicament doesn't reflect and represent everyone, but in the specific stories it chooses I think it was perfectly executed. I really, really hope this wins Best Picture - especially considering its main contender *Trial of the Chicago 7* which actually does romanticise/Sorkinize history to a dangerous extent.",1

The Concrete Masterpiece kept me engaged with interesting and animated characters (nice to see Adrien Brody having fun).

The Police Commissioner segment was very dull apart from the car chase and I kept wanting it to end to move onto the next segment.

I don’t think seen a poster or any form of advertising for it prior to the trailer I was tagged. in on Facebook months ago.

Ultimately this is a shame as it’s a pretty decent movie. The setting and creature design is cool/fresh. I love creature films and I would’ve loved if they showed different life at the bottom of the ocean besides the one thing Kirsten Stewart woke up next to her after SPOILER losing the captain. It might’ve been cool to have a giant squid these creatures destroyed.

I thought it might be a possibility a creature made it into the ship besides the one that got TJ Miller however not the case. Actually speaking on that how did a sizeable creature, enough to pull him out of his suit, get into the base? The water was flowing through a crack into the little section they had to swim through, those creatures were pretty big so strange they left it as soon as TJ Miller died they didn’t really want to bother with the one in with them.

Anyways I enjoyed it and I will always try to get to the creature feature movies so we have more of them in the future but it’s a shame this didn’t get the attention I feel it’s worthy of. Hopefully streaming services bring attention to it as it did seem they were pushing for the sequel set up at the end with the newspaper clippings but to likely no avail based off it flopping",0

26264,"A few details I noticed and loved:

- That Mrs Kim was right about Mr Kim the whole time when she said ""when the lights turn on around him he scatters like a cockroach"". The first thing Mr Kim does when he's finally exposed in killing Mr Park is flee and scurry into the darkness of the basement. 

- Mr Park previously says to Mrs Park that he likes Kim because he comes close to ""crossing the line"" in terms of getting too personal but always stops himself. This makes it all the more intense when Kim finally has enough of his resentment and shame and does ""cross the line"" by killing Park. Its also an interesting metaphor that in doing so Kim showed that even for a brief moment he wasnt truely a parasite because he was willing to keep his pride instead of continue to leech unlike Guen-Se who had an almost sycophantic admiration for Mr Park. You could also interpret it as Kim truely becoming a true parasite as some do end up killing their host in the end.

- Mr Park didn't know he had Guen-Se in his basement for 4 years. This reflects how people that contract parasites may not even notice having one at first but they're still unknowingly giving the parasite all it needs to survive.

- The scenes with the drunk guy peeing in the street by the Kims basement home may seem just for laughs but it showed that while  the family had basically nothing they still had their pride and this is what made them dangerous. What was also fascinating about Mr Kim was he seemed like a waster, who thinks honest work is pointless and doesn't seem to care about anything at all so accepts his position in life. But deep down there is pain, resentment, pride and anger. He reacts so badly to his wife's claim that he'll scatter when he's exposed because he knows its true. He claims he's just acting when he reacts violently, but the truth is he's actually acting constantly and that was one of the few moments he was being real. The whole family aren't just acting to leech off of the Parks. They lie and act constantly day to day with others and to themselves.",1

25072,"The basement door was one of the things I found most intriguing. I interpreted the scotch tape as a fragile and final attempt by Jake to keep crucial secrets locked away from other fragmented personalities. Fragile because Jake is nearing death and doesn’t have the strength to create a stronger boundary against the part of his psyche that is wondering around and making discoveries: Lucy. 

Prior to Lucy entering the basement, we see the most vibrant version of his mother. She tells Lucy very revealing information: “Jake can be controlling. I think it’s the other side of his type of personality. He needs to control everything. There are so many, many things that make him nervous.” I’ll come back to this in a sec....

The moment this version of his mom enters is a brilliant interpretation of someone suffering Dissociative Personality Disorder. In this case Jake. 

Jakes mother at dinner constantly looking to him in fear, him forcing her to eat the baby food, or him deciding to show Lucy the barn first while his mother notices are just a few indications that Jake is the primary personality to the various fragmented personalities we are seeing interacting in his head. However, this begins to change. 

When the vibrant version of Jakes mother comes into play, you’ll notice how abruptly she enters. This is also the only time we see her without Jake in the scene. Something in the conversation with Lucy and his dad right before triggered Jake, causing this energetic and young version of his mother to swiftly take control. 

Obviously this mother was from a time when Jake was a child. She tells Lucy: “I’m probably to blame” referring to his need to be in control and for the few people in his life to follow his rules. She must have caused some serious trauma and is a version of his mother he worked hard to keep suppressed.
Something caused him to slip up and you LITERALLY see her slide into the scene like she was waiting for the right moment. It’s fascinating. 

Now we have a fragmented and dominant version of his mother in control of imagined and unaware Lucy. His mother tells Lucy to “take the darn nightgown to the basement.” She does this in a hushed voice to not trigger Jake in taking back control. 

Seeing Jake inaudibly panicking and banging on the door as Lucy descends down, shows that Jake is losing the power to keep those in his life to follow his rules...referring back to what his mother mentions. These fragmented personalities schemed against him to reveal secrets. 

I think that’s why the next interpretation of his mother is her dead. 

I could analyze the movie for hours, but this scene sort of was the realization of what was really going on and in who’s mind and also just how mysterious the mind and these diseases are.",0

25346,"It wasn’t that I didn’t get it or don’t enjoy films with multiple themes. I thought Jake was the janitor the second time they showed him (it wasn’t subtle) and realized the GF/narrator and his parents/most characters were just characters in his mind fairly early on. It was clear the title of movie wasn’t referencing a break up. This isn’t as simple as The Witch was advertised as a typical horror movie but really it was something far better and some simps didn’t get it. 

I don’t think you need to be a film noir expert to enjoy this movie/most movies, but I did take some film classes in college and I really like several Kaufman movies. I’m not a marvel guy. I like weird dialogue heavy movies. This movie was just very boring and meaningless to me. Just because they mention Tolstoy and reference older art films doesn’t make it good. I agree it was a smart movie that was unique, the actors performed well, and Kaufman put a lot of thought into it but that doesn’t make it good. 

Literally the majority of the movie is two people who don’t like each other in car talking about nothing. Their dialogue didn’t reveal very much about the plot or the characters. It’s simply the inner monologue of a hopeless mad man and a lot of films have depicted that better. I don’t care that she can recite a movie review word for word. The only part of the movie that was remotely entertaining was the dinner scene and her walking through the house while things are changing. They literally spend a lot of the movie talking about better movies. The only thing the dialogue revealed that was remotely interesting to me is the possibility that he was sexually abused by his father, his fear of being gay or appearing feminine/his relationship with his mom, and how difficult it is for men to deal with sexual abuse when society doesn’t support them as much/there are far fewer depictions of men dealing with sexual trauma in art compared to a woman’s perspective. 

Then it ends with a silent dream ballet, him winning the Noble Prize, and a cute ambiguous did he kill himself or didn’t he ending? It was peak pretension and self indulgence. He literally shows us a dumpster full of ice cream cups to hit the audience over head with “see, he plays this out in his head a lot.” It was terrible. I was bored the entire time.",0

It worked because it was novel. A sequel will just beat a dead horse. This movie wasn't entertaining because we needed Big action (it was certainly a factor). It was it's absolutely awesome pacing, subversing of expected stereotypes and the total lack of sense to the whole movie (I completely lost it when he found the goddamn kitty bracelet under his sofa, which started this whole mess). It was unexpected, people will expect that now in the sequel, which will take the whole wind out of the sails and what made the movie good. More action will be boring. There really is nothing new they could do. John Wick got away with cranking the fantasy up to 11, which will not work in this one. It's more down to earth (while still being over the top ofc) and established itself as a cruder movie. John Wick already had dream- and fantasylike settings.

Mirabel's character was so lovable and charismatic.  I loved her style and the choices that they made with her look, demeanor, and personality.

I really enjoyed about half of the songs, while some others were a little muddled or the kind of middle-of-the road, ""this is a musical and it's been a while so I guess we should put a song here"" kind of songs.  Definitely could feel LMM's influence/style.

The story was pretty good.  While I loved the reconciliation between Mirabel and Isabela, it happened too quickly and with almost no real effort of genuine apology, empathy, or introspection.  It simply felt like a red-herring plot device to obfuscate that the real conflict was between Mirabel and her Grandma.

Speaking of, Grandma's redemption was also juuustt a little too easy/convenient.  They could have worked on that a little more where you can see her heart change back to cherishing what she has rather than fearing what is lost.

Louisa was so precious.  Loved her ""here's how I feel inside"" song but again, the pressure and burdens that she has had to bear weren't physical -- they were mental, and that wasn't really resolved in the end.  I guess maybe a little -- she got to sit in a hammock there for a bit?  Ok back to work holding this family and community together (physically)!

I was disappointed that Delores and Camila had very little to add to this movie.  Why didn't Delores hear grandma praying for help to save the family near the beginning of the movie? We knew she could have, considering she can hear Louisa's eye twitch and Mirabel's confession to her dad.  Camila was only a changeling used for physical comedy.  We got to know nothing about, and gained no real rapport with this person in the movie, unfortunately.

Antonio's affinity for Mirabel was fantastic.  You could feel the bond between them and the scene where he reached out to her to help walk him to his door was adorable.

I absolutely hate how they brushed off Bruno's return to good graces.  He's been unjustly outcast for years, patching the house together from the inside, longing for his family, and when he finally gets accepted back into the fold, he is brushed aside after a quick hug from Grandma.

At the end, I teared up at the family's acknowledgment of Mirabel as she approached the front door.

I felt the first scene was incredible, and the best spectacle of the whole film, but for me didn’t do a good enough job to set the tone for the rest of the movie, or give me enough to care about our main character at all. It’s cool that he would sacrifice himself for his country/ the job, but that wasn’t enough of a “call to action” for me as viewer. Visuals were incredible, can’t wait for BTS some day, and Nolan is an INCREDIBLE filmmaker. I don’t even think the story was all that confusing or hard to follow...I just didn’t feel too compelled by the whole “world is gonna end” when I don’t really care about about any of the characters. That’s why a film like infinity war pulled that off so well. We cared more about the characters and that allowed us to think “holy shit, what if our loved ones all were dusted.” 

This was just “oh no plutonium” (they said it like 1000 times) and “oh no, the algorithm!!!” Which got so redundant and cheesy to me",0

And those old ways seem to be killing the zombies with some lame martial arts. And we all knew that the baby would go to the aboriginals.

32747,"My ★★★★ review of Booksmart on Letterboxd https://boxd.it/IDn2N

Definitely one of the better films in this R rated coming of age subgenre, mainly due to the two lead performances. Particularly Kaitlyn Dever, she has been good in lots of stuff before this but she showed tons of charisma and comedic presence. Feldstein finally didn't seem like female Jonah Hill for me, and I expect her to be getting all the comedic best friend roles for awhile. Billie Lourd is also very good, but the best in the whole cast for me is definitely Skyler Gisondo. He can make me laugh by saying basically anything, and is insanely charismatic. Now that Santa Clarita Diet is cancelled, he needs to be cast in every comedy project moving forward.

Since Booksmart will obviously be compared to Superbad, it isn't the same level for me at all; but very few comedies are. I do appreciate the added depth to the supporting characters in Booksmart though, it definitely does that better. I am not the peak target audience for this film, so if it means even half of what Superbad means to me (which I expect it to, since it's good) to some woman out there then it definitely did its job.

Edit: I would never encourage piracy but this movie is on Netflix in Pakistan already, so with how the internet works...",0

63213,"What surprised me the most, and the thing that really made the film for me (quite unexpectedly so) was the CHEMISTRY Chris Pine and Gal Gadot had. I know Gal is the central character of the movie, but I really want to applaud Chris too. I feel like in a lot of the interviews even, that he is often overlooked as questions are directed more to Gal and Patty. But he's also half the reason why the relationship between Steve and Diana came off to be as so authentic and genuine - I absolutely loved them together, and that isn't something I say often when it comes to human-superhero love stories. I loved how they navigated through each of their worlds together, and their scenes didn't feel cheesy or corny. Originally thought Pine's character would be too much like a ""guide"" for Wonder Woman, but he was so much more. He held his own.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, there were moments where I felt like it dragged on for a bit (but only just a bit), but the other (quite fantastic) moments bounced the movie right back up for me. Yes, there were a lot of CG involved but that was to be expected (and honestly, the trailer that came before this movie was Transformers so...). But Gal Gadot was amazing as Wonder Woman no doubt about that. She embodied her beautifully. She had courage, love, compassion, determination and innocence.

42217,"Starting with the easy, the performances were all really great. Especially liked Amy Adams. 

I think the main issue I had with this movie was Adam Mckay's (the director) style/approach. The mixing of real footage, photos, news clips, etc. right into the regular narrative can work really well, as it did in *The Big Short* (Mckay's other movie.) However, *The Big Short* was about the housing market crash -- the movie was trying to explain an event, and news clips/real footage really lends itself well to explaining things and giving credibility to the narrative. This style works well with ideas or events as the main focus of the movie, but doesn't work when the movie is supposed to be a character drama/study, in the case of Vice. I wanted to see a ruthless Dick Cheney slowly gaining power in the white house. Instead we got a buffet of random Dick Cheney moments at different points in his life and reactionary news clip footage, with an awkward voiceover filling in gaps. 

**TL;DR** The style doesn't work for the subject matter, but the movie is entertaining with good performances. 5/10. ",1

73254,"The ""Shiny"" song actually touched in a really important theme at that point in the story - the conflict of where your identity comes from. Tamatoa crafted his identity superficially, shallowly... he criticizes Moana for thinking there's something inside her that tells her who she is, and confronts Maui with his tragedy (loss of identity) and points out their similarity, that they both define their identity through superficial things (Maui's tattoos, representing his achievements, being his 'skin deep' identity)

The song was not only fun, it was a vital foreshadowing of the central theme of the movie, the certainty of identity in the face of tragedy and self-doubt. It was the classic scene where the villain shows how their philosophy is great, how it'd be so easy and fun to give up and live life their way (he literally doesn't have to work to eat), and how the heroes have got it all wrong.

And while I agree the style was out of place, that was also a part of the theme, I think... it is more new age and less rooted in tradition than the more Polynesian inspired songs on the soundtrack, reflecting that Tamatoa is all flash and has forged a shallow identity with no history or family. He even ate his grandma!

That's what made Pixar such a huge sensation: They did something new and different and told fresh stories through an (at the time) unusual medium. Given, these days CG animation is the bread and butter of animated films, so if anything Laika has a bit of a leg up on Pixar for having a unique and particularly rare visual style that looks different for every film they do, yet always somehow has the patented ""Laika Look"".

They also made the choice to veer to the slightly creepy side, so their movies are great for all ages. Young kids can watch them, even if they might be a bit scared at certain things, all the way to adults who can appreciate some of the humor more as well as the dedication that goes into the animation. Younger viewers can also watch it as they grow older and gain a deeper appreciation for it, so the films, in a way, ""grow"" with the viewer even though they'll never change.

I'm not saying that Laika or Pixar are better, but Laika is at the very least a close second to Pixar. They have every iota of talent, artistry and storytelling skill that Pixar has, if not more for the literal physical labor that's required to animate their films.",0

Maybe I missed something, but the movie was filled with manufactured tension, varying characters with slightly above averages at best, and a sagging plot that fizzled to an inevitable conclusion.",1
3940,"I apologise because I know I am going to write a lot here. 
I feel like I live in a parallel universe where everyone saw a different movie. The animation style and especially the way the 3d is rendered are absolutely fantastic, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this movie. It was frankly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, maybe not downright the worst but surely the most painful. The dated memes and the formulaic plot are just minor gripes I have with this movie, the problems here are far greater. 

First off, this movie keeps saying that being ""a loser"" makes you somewhat special and unique, but everyone is a loser in real life. Being a loser, struggling to keep your shit together and wanting to realise your dream is the reality of everyone's daily life. If ""being a loser"" is all you have to define your characters they come out as extremely shallow. The scene at the end where the supposed ""perfect neighbours"" compliment the main characters because they are ""unique"" or some shit filled me with a dread I had never felt while watching a movie before. Also, it is never clear why they are supposedly losers. The daughter is painted as being confused and oblivious to social norms, she sends the uni commission an absurd amount of her movie projects from when she was a kid in a scene that is clearly played for laughs and seems set up to precede her failure. Except she doesn't, she gets accepted and she immediately makes friends with a bunch of people over Zoom. The same goes for everyone else, they are just losers when the plot needs them to be. 

Secondly, the absolutely abusive and manipulative attitude the father character displays is portrayed as being ""just misguided"", and it's suggested both he and his daughters have to learn to understand the other one. Except is not like that at all. The father is constantly imposing his world view, while the daughter doesn't force him once to change. She knows and accepts her father is a different animal than she is, and lives life in his way. All she asks for is being respected for how she does things, and to have the room for growing as her own person. The dude smashes her laptop, cancels her flight, constantly undermines her and violates her self determination. A sad backstory of him not being able to realise his own dreams doesn't justify him undermining and gaslighting his daughter like that. I hated that their conflict was portrayed as them being equally at fault. 

But because you can't complain about something without offering a solution, at least partial, here's what I propose. Basically play the movie almost verbatim as it happens, except have the apocalypse plot be just the movie the daughter sends her uni as a submission. Don't have the dad cancel her flight after breaking her laptop, have him feel genuinely bad about this and offer her to drive around the state while filming her dream project - but reveal this just at the end of the movie. Maybe she always wanted to make an action-comedy epic about the robot apocalypse but never could due to lack of resources. By showing that the dad is finally willing to learn about her passions and her dream job, the message goes from being ""accept abusive shit your family does"" to ""give a shot to the generation you don't understand"". All the nonsense that happens in the plot and all the things the movie gets wrong about technology are suddenly justified and the message becomes much more positive. 

Also cut the boomer meme shit. The girl is supposed to be a Z gen and should be laughing at deep fried nonsense and Dababy turning people into convertibles, not bottom text impact memes and rage comics from fucking 2009",0

Jackson's hat, Ally's face (nose, hair, eyes looking directly at the camera), the fisheye lens when Jackson is on stage, blinding lights (on stage but also in the garage, positioned like stage lights), repeated lyrics  (including but not limited to ""maybe it's time to let the old ways die"" and ""we're far from the shallow now""). The world that these characters inhabit comes to life because of these little touches and lends the film an honesty and authenticity that a lot of other movies lack.

One other point, I was blown away by the immediate and effortless mythologizing of Jackson Maine in the film's early scenes. This character is so earnest and the day-to-day experiences he has with his fame are so organic that I immediately forgot that I was watching Bradley Cooper.",1

69111,"Spoiler ahead: 
I totally get that; I too felt very sad at the end (saw the day before yesterday)  and for a moment I just looked at my companion and said WTF was that; is it over. Cause it just ends.  But then I thought about it, and what it is supposed to depict is real life and how real situations go down in the end.  Movie tropes have taught us that in this type of melodramatic family drama there is going to be either a big happy ending or a big sad ending. Real life isn't that way it's kind of somewhere in between and it doesn't end w/a curtain call or a movie ending, it just kind of meanders along. Like in MBTS.

So, WRT this specific ending, while we would expect Lee to grow and change and be all touchy-feely and be a proper guardian, in real life it just ain't that way, in such a DEFINED linear way. This particular soul was too damaged a person at that point in time to be a full-time parent.  And he knew it and he wanted the boy to have the best possible life so he made sure that he was taken care of with a close, loving family friend. All the while, making plans for the future ie getting a 1 bedroom apartment instead of the crappy studio he had; that's HUGE - this is subtle growth because heretofore he'd been living an extremely solitary life with zero room in any way for even one more person.  While he knew that he could not be full-time he made future plans to be a part-time guardian, the best that he could do because he was still extremely ill-equipped himself. His maturity was that he recognized this - he knew that he wasn't ready yet and that his nephew needed a more stable home - yet still made sure that he would continue his loving relationship with his nephew as best as he possibly could with perhaps hope for future living arrangements to change.

He goes out on the boat with his nephew: a repeat of the loving fun pasttime they used to do together in happier times. There is, for the first time in the present day scenes, a slight smile on Lee's face and definite contentment in this beloved hobby that they did together, as when they were closer years ago. This is a sign that Lee has started on the road to joy again, little bursts of joy. He is FINALLY on the road to BABY STEPS of recovery. 

So although it's a very subtle growth and we need to examine it - it is growth, there was a huge arc there from solitary recluse, to someone who sees a light at the end of the tunnel and will maintain this healthy, necessary relationship in the future in the best way he knows how. 

Remember he was suicidal at one point so this was a huge healing step for him.

16920,"The pharmacy scene seemed like it was taking the movie in the exact direction I was worried it was going to go - she falls for the guy and settles down and it turns into a rather anticlimactic romantic ending. One of the really brilliant things about that scene, though, if you watch closely you’ll notice everyone in the background is looking on them disapprovingly. The cashier, in particular, looks downright *ticked off* at them, probably because they’re making a mess and she’s going to have to clean it up. Even the other customer in the store looks uncomfortable, like they’re just being disruptive and weird. Contrast that with typical romcoms where this kind of childish behavior in (young) adults in love is met with indulgent smiles by any onlookers. As they leave, Cassie apologizes. It’s brief, but it’s there. 

The romcom contrast of that whole montage segment of them falling in love fits in with the rest of the movie by juxtaposition. Just as it seems she’s moving on with her life, that traumatic past rears its ugly head again: she gets the video from Madison and finds out Ryan was at the party. It’s like she was finally starting to heal and then something happens to send everything crashing down again. The highs in the middle of the plot make everything that happens after that much more impactful.",1

[The film's willingness to kill characters very suddenly and without warning was gutsy, but it ended up stripping so many elements out of the narrative that it became extremely unsatisfying. Like the FBI stuff was intriguing, and it's completely gone after ~45 minutes. There's no real emotional climax between the sisters either. I'm okay with it going dark, but that was a lot of build-up for ""little sister seems to decide she doesn't care (but we don't really know for sure because all she does after is try to kill somebody who murdered her lover)."" There was probably ways to circle back to some of this stuff even with the deaths, like another character seriously confronting the little sister, but we don't get that.](#spoiler)

I might be in the minority on this, but Hemsworth felt like some bad miscasting to me. I wonder how much better the second half would have worked if they had gotten some actor who can manage more than being funny and looking handsome. Not to begrudge him for either quality -- those are great! -- but some roles require something more. This was one of them.

I look at his behavior later in the film more as a result of his relapse caused by grief and the destruction of his marriage (Martha withdrew from him completely and shut him out) and the behavior of an addict and less as a representation of him as a person. His entire character arc is him falling apart because of how much he cares.

37420,"I feel bad for saying this particular criticism but I felt like the film went on a downward spiral when it came to enjoyability. The film totally had me with it's opening musical numbers, particularly the Saturday scene all the way up to when he first performed at Troubadour, but then the film just went on a really tonal downward spiral. Obviously, this was Elton's life and I don't want to disrespect what he went through, but the film really oddly is joyful and then inverts into something really somber. And for all the build-up, the climax was really abrupt and unfulfilling. Frankly, it didn't even feel like a climax at all. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not complaining that the film was darker, but the pacing went from energetic, brisk, and fun to something pretty slow and dramatic, and I felt that. But then again, it's hard for a film like this to find room to breathe. I don't think you can fit many fun moments within all the drugs and drinking, so I realize the irony in my criticism, but it was definitely tonal whiplash and I don't think I would view this again past music videos on YouTube or something. Something about the pacing felt off during his downward spiral as well, so I don't even really know if that portion was all that compelling. Can't put my finger on what felt off, though.",0

aside from the sex scene on the yacht filmed with the drones, which is only notable due to the camera angles and how overlong the scene itself is, the sex scenes are nothing you haven't seen before in a Cinemax (Skinemax) show that airs after 11:30 PM. i actually found most of the passionate scenes extremely offputting given the film's propensity to frame the male and female lead as sexy bantering rivals rather than, you know, a kidnapper and his fucking kidnapping victim.",0

26239,"The scene where the guy is peaking from the staircase is pretty scary for a movie that's not a horror flick. What makes it interesting is that there were many things throughout the film that made this particular scene so terrifying.

A. The fact that there's a buggy eyed man peaking from your staircase alone.

B. We found out the picture the son kept drawing was the face of the ""ghost"" he saw that night. The corner of the drawing that ""Jessica"" mentions was actually the basement where the man came from.

C. The most terrifying thing about this scene for me was that Mrs. Park thought her son saw a ghost, when she and her family were completely unaware that what her son actually saw was in fact a real person who was living under their house for four whole years.

Mrs. Park assuming that the guy her son saw was a ""ghost"" is very in tune with one of the ongoing themes of the movie that the Parks are completely oblivious to their surroundings in their own home. For instance, they didn't realize that the people who were working for them was actually a family playing tricks on them, and they had no idea that their maid was hiding her husband for four years in a basement that they were also unaware of. The Parks could've figured it all out had they just looked down. They would've saw the visible mess that the Kims made under the couches. They would've caught the Kims hiding under the table and realized that they were actually a family all along. They would've found out that the maid was hiding her husband had they looked deeper inside their home, but the fact that the Parks never looked down to see what's right under their nose will forever stick with the audience. The creators of the film did an excellent job with storytelling. The foreshadowing and imagery in this film was very carefully placed.",1

Sure, it has a bunch of issues that could’ve been done away with using tighter writing and editing, but as a whole, *Split* was next level stuff in comparison to M. Knights previous films. The cinematography just floored me with how those shots were framed and filmed in such tight spaces. And Anya Taylor-Joy becoming even more of a powerhouse actress since *The Witch* and *Barry*. And fucking James McAvoy, holy shit, was this guy something else.

As much as I loved this film, I can see people outright disliking or hating it. Especially those that have a hard time ‘buying’ into an inherently absurd premise such as dissociative identity disorder changing the way the human body works. Just remember that the film isn’t going for scientific accuracy or Le STEM. It’s telling a story about how people – mostly children – are often terribly affected by psychological trauma.

There are some genuinely crazy shit in this, like the fucking uncle scene in the woods that most filmmakers would’ve avoided given how its treading on thin ice with how it could’ve gone so wrong or been absolutely distasteful, and that masterfully directed, shot, and acted final twenty minutes or so in the climax between Casey and almost every personality inside Kevin.

I think in the same way that Heloise, Sophie, and Marianne take apart the lover's choice vs. the poet's choice, this is Sciamma's debate of the artist's choice vs. the realist's choice. 

The artist's choice, as most romantic movies make, would be to cut away at the end of the love affair. It's still tragic, but in a contained way. It doesn't spill over into the after. It lets the viewer hold the the affair in their minds untouched and clean. 

Sciamma seemed to want to avoid every single ""standard"" romance movie decision in the interest of giving us fully fleshed-out women. I think by showing the ""after"" of that scene, it holds the viewer's head and forces us to look at the reality following the decisions of Heloise and Marianne. However it's not necessarily messy and gritty and dark the way that media that make the realist's choice often is (Brokeback Mountain does this I'd argue). In the way that women have pretty much always done, they get up and carry on existing in the wider world. There's no dramatic, slow spiral. Yet it's just as tragic because it's allows us to see how the details of the lives of the Mariannes and Heloises, these great love affairs, were lost to the invisibility created by womanhood.

She manages to make the realist's choice and the artist's choice while portraying women, something film rarely manages to do. It was brilliant.",0

74852,"Saw the movie last week in regular 2d. And I must say that I wasn't impressed. I'm not sure what I expected from this movie, but definitely not what I saw. First of all, the visuals were great for the most part. Obviously, the most attention was paid to main characters and their animation, so most other creatures looked a bit fake. The best animated and looking ones were Bagheera and Shere Khan, Balu felt bit fakey in my opinion. Wolves looked the worst of the bunch and had little emotion on their faces in comparison to other main animals. The cinematography was pretty nice for the most part, some really creative visuals here and there but aside from few scenes nothing much stands out in my mind. Don't want to spoil anything, but few scenes at the end of the movie were pretty breathtaking.

The kid that played Mowgli is alright. He's not terrible, but he's not very good either. I never bought him as a kid of the jungle, though, but considering that all he had to work with is green screen I think he did alright. He looked the part, that's for sure.

The thing that disappointed and underwhelmed me the most is the story. Yeah, I know some of you will say that it's just a kids' movie, what do you expect and the original wasn't that smart and so on, and all I can answer is that it's not an excuse. This movie felt shallow. Like really, really shallow and it felt underdeveloped. First of all, with new more realistic visuals the viewer expects a bit more realism in workings of the world. I can buy talking animals, I can buy singing animals, but what I can't buy is the kid who lived all his life in a jungle among feral animals who never shows any signs of it, never acts like an animal (aside from like one short moment in the whole movie) and overall just feels like just a human that just got lost in a jungle for one weekend. I know it was like that in the original movie, but that was a silly comedy that never made pretense that it's somehow serious. This movie really wanted to be smarter and more serious, but it missed its chance completely. You can suspense the disbelief only so much until it breaks. And it breaks hard right from the beginning. Kids' acting certainly didn't help, but I must say that he acted like a kid and never felt more advanced that he looked, which is rare among child characters in movies.

The plot was a bit more coherent and developed than the one from the original movie, but had little of that Disney trademark heart in it. The emotional moments rang hollow, because the movie never bothered to make a viewer sympathise or relate to Mowgli. He's a very simple character. He's just a kid who wants to stay in the jungle. That's it. There's little to no conflict or development in him. He almost never acts on his own and things just kinda happen to him and he gets thrown from one place to another, from one setpiece into another. He's boring. So is the movie, at least the first half. The first third, until Mowgli meets Balu contains plenty of cringeworthy moments (yeah, Disney family movies usually have plenty of them, but they usually feel genuine and with a heart in the right place) and was pretty boring. Lots of stuff happens that you, as a viewer, has no reason to care about because you had no chance to get invested in it. The story was very, very simple. A saturday morning cartoon kinda simple. There are no interesting themes being brought up, nothing of the sorts. Not entirely bad thing, but not enough for this movie's runtime, so there's a lot of padding.

Balu saves this movie. He isn't particularly funny, but he's likeable and brings much-needed silliness to the overall proceedings and gives the movie a second breath. He's a good addition to the story and makes it more lighthearted and fun. His song was also really nice and adds a lot to the movie. So does King Louie. He's the best part of the movie. I kid you not. He's menacing, he's interesting, he's awesome. And his song is so much fun, even if it starts from out of almost nowhere. I liked him a lot and his setpiece is very enjoyable to watch. Shere Khan is meh. Sure, his animation is spectacular and he can be pretty frightening, but he's just as shallow as any of them. You have no reason to care for him, out of sympathy or an interest. Looks cool, but he mostly does nothing throughout the movie outside of growling and looking menacing. Still, his scenes are enjoyable enough, especially at the end. Bagheera is a nice mentor figure, but there isn't much more to him.

Cinderella gave the tired old story new, fresh blood by adding much needed complexity into the story and its characters. Not the whole lot, but it was on point and made it much more enjoyable. It had plenty of heart and a lot of Disney's trademark magic. This one tries to do the same, but trips over its own tail constantly. It's like nobody knew what to do with it. Make it gritty or make it silly, make it dark or make it fun. It's a mess. When it works, it works brilliantly, when it doesn't it's just boring. Maybe if I watched the English version I'd like it more, but I'm not sure that good voice actors can save a lame story. Maybe I expected too much from this movie and wanted an epic journey full of perils and challenges, interesting story and characters. I probably should've known better.

It's not a bad movie and it's certainly watchable, but it's not very good either. If you love the original one you'll probably like this one too. It might be the best The Jungle Book out there, though, whatever that counts for. Usually Disney movies leave me feeling really good about myself and the world, this one left me with nothing. Btw, that awesome Bare Necessities music from the trailers isn't used in the movie until the very end for one small sequence. Major letdown. Also, the trailers showed every major setpiece in the movie. The theater was full of kids and they laughed all the time, so they probably liked the movie a whole lot.

TL;DR It was underwhelming.

37888,"Wow, I gotta say as a lifelong fan of Gunnm/Battle Angel, who has been waiting for over a decade for this movie (I was so frustrated when Cameron made Avatar instead), this was 100% perfect and exceeded my expectations in every way! Gunnm was one of the primary reasons I became an artist, it was so inspiring to me. I kept remembering things from the manga right before they happened, and it was so wonderful to see them done so fantastically. I always felt like Rollerball was the weakest part of the saga (well, besides most of Last Order) but even that was absolutely stunning in this in iMax 3D.

The cast was basically perfect, I always saw Wynona Ryder as Alita but alas she's too old now, Rosa Salazar did a great job though. I especially liked Ido and Vector. It's a shame there's not much Nova in this part of the story, he is my favorite character.

It is just an absolute love letter to fans, I can't even believe a big budget movie this accurate to a somewhat obscure 90s manga managed to get created. I sure hope it does well enough overseas to have more! Sadly enough it stops at the same place the anime did, and in my opinion that's right before the story really takes off.

It exhilarated me like Spirited Away did when I saw that in theaters for the first time. I've been pretty lukewarm or flat out disappointed with most of what pixar has put out since The Incredibles and Wall-E, but they really out did themselves this time. 

It's also the first one to legitimately make me cry. I immediately starting thinking about people I knew who have passed who I may have forgotten about because I just imagined them vanishing into dust. This cartoon had me in this state pondering death, the afterlife, those I've lost, and memories. How my grandfather passed of Alzheimer and how I will never forget that man as long as I live, or how scary it is for me to think about forgetting others. This sounds unpleasant, but it's exhilarating and comforting. 

 It has so many great messages that aren't bludgeoned over the head, but that are genuinely heartfelt and universal. The appreciation of Mexican culture was also pitch perfect, I'm not mexican myself, but in Trump's america this is the type of film we need right now. It's a loving valentine to mexican culture and festivities, but it never comes across as pandering or cheap. It celebrates family in the most fulfilling of ways. Never overly sentimental or coming across obvious like it's shoving it down your throat. It just naturally exudes this amazing warmth. 

I also got a lot of Studio Ghibli vibes. Also, the voice work is outstanding, I loved the songs (which can usually be hit and miss for me in an animated film), and the characters were bursting with life. This all sounds so hyperbolic, I'm just stunned I fell in love with this as much as I have.

I think we live in an era of film, where everything hast to be on a silver platter.  Who was the third robber and where did he go?  Who was management?  Was it the FBI/CIA or another entity.  To me the answer to these questions dont bother me.

It was just nice to get a little breath of fresh air.  To find a concept that hasn't been beaten to death.  That Cynthia Erivo stole the show and was great.  Jeff Bridges was fantastic.

24713,"ultimately, the preconceptions you bring to it will affect how you interpret the content, but the way i see it, they started this ""experiment"" in order to change themselves. they were cloaking it in this pseudo-academic language, but for martin, it was clearly an attempt to awaken some life within himself

and once they began enjoying it, rather than staying on that even keel, they wanted to just keep pushing, because that's what happens when you're chasing a particular feeling. first martin pushes himself to 0.1%, then they enter 'phase 2' of the 'experiment' as an excuse to down cocktails and go wild, etc. and naturally at a certain point this means their ability to stay functioning alcoholics has vanished and it's spilling over into their lives. which, of course, started screwing their lives up

tommy, who was completely unmoored from anything in life worth staying around for, couldn't reel himself back in. the other three could - they had reasons to get their lives back in order. and although the movie does end with them drinking again, and with martin going into his ballet moves, i don't think it can either be 1. straightforwardly a sign that he has recaptured his inner life or 2. an ominous indicator that he will collapse into drunkenness again. i think it ultimately depends on whether they have something in their lives which provides the meaning and the foundation to make them want to keep themselves in check",0

My dad displayed “King Richard” tendencies when I was growing up. I was pretty good at tennis and competed in USTA, but never really fell in love with the sport the way the family did (and as a result never got past the Open-level). I actually grew to resent both my dad and the sport and left it all together. I watched it with my family and got the feeling that I came away with different takeaways than them.

Like Richard was great and all, but only because it worked. I burned out from the expectations, pressure, and I often feel fractured from all the pressure that was put on me (not just tennis, but really everything). 

Should we applaud Richard for empowering two of the greatest athletes of all time and a symbol of pride for the Black community? Is this what it takes to be “great”? What about people like Capriati and all the “lesser” athletes like me who never got close? Did their dads and mentors do the right thing as well?

Again, lovely movie and great acting. Found myself tearing up a lot. I guess I’m just using this comment as a journal entry.",1
61708,"Saw it recently. 

I thought it was a pretty slick and stylish adaptation. It definitely has its moments. But it has its flaws too.

-Branagh's performance as Poirot was masterful. Suchet had totally nailed the character of course, so its just as well that Branagh tried something a little difference. To me, he came across as a kind of modern take on Peter Ustinov's portrayal of Poirot (the size of the moustache notwithstanding, he kinda looks like Ustinov as Poirot). All the familiar tics and attributes of the character from the book are present - albeit, portrayed just about differently enough to feel like something new. Poirot's OCD contributing to his detection skills. His being very finicky and stubborn about his likes and dislikes. His arrogance and occasional rudeness. All very much from the books, but emphasized in a whole new way.

-The other performances were great too. Depp played a very different Ratchett from the one in the original film, and its a change that proved interesting. Ridley nailed Mary Debenham. The 'Biminio Marquez' character perfectly mirrored the Antonio Foscarelli of the original. Judi Dench's Dragomiroff actually felt closer to the princess in the book than the one in the old film. Pfieffer nailed Mrs. Hubbard (she kinda reminded me of the Mrs. Hubbard character from the 2001 TV version). I LOVED Dafoe's new take on Hardman. Macqueen, Masterman, Hildegard Schmidt, Pilar Estavados (aka Greta Olsson) etc. were pretty different from the originals in various ways, but also kinda worked. The major disappointment for me was Count Andreyni. I didn't care at all for this new ballet dancer/martial artist version. The new Countess Andreyni was an interesting take, albeit not very well explored in the film.

-In terms of the plot, the film more or less crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's of Christie's original plot. And I feel it would have been better off if it stuck to that (with a few superficial changes). Because the few significant changes that HAVE been made were pretty disappointing and unnecessary. [The whole 'fight scene' between Poirot and Arbuthnot for instance. It replaced the FAR superior scene from the original film where Poirot pretends to aggressively interrogate Miss Debenham to provoke Arbuthnot, compelling both of them to come clean about their relationship.] (#spoiler) I'm not saying the new scene is bad on its own merits - it just pales in comparison to the more cerebral approach taken in the original film. Then of course there's the whole ['Macqueen stealing from Ratchett' plot - a needless red-herring which doesn't actually make sense when you think of the larger plot (Macqueen the secretary might steal from Ratchett...Macqueen, the conspirator in Ratchett's murder has absolutely no reason to do so, or even pretend to do so.)] (#spoiler). The worst part is that these scenes take away valuable time from the film which could have been used to better service the actual plot. Instead, we get Poirot's rushed deductions about some of the suspects right at the end of the film, where it comes across a little as him being psychic, rather than having actually deduced something based on evidence and reasoning.

-The cinematography and direction was outstanding. Particularly the locations (both real and CGI). I kinda liked how some of the scenes were set in the surroundings outside the train. The indoor surroundings tended to get boring after a while in the original. (That's another thing I loved about the 2001 version, which also had them wandering outside the train a little). The scenes in Istanbul and Jeruselem were great too. I loved the black-and-white flashbacks. But the one piece of shooting I didn't care much for was [the flashback to the actual murder. It seemed confused and frenzied, which I suppose was more 'realistic'...but I always loved the murder scene in the original film where they come in one by one, state their reason for killing Ratchett, and then stab him.] (#spoiler).

-And now of course, we come to the moral aspect of the ending. [It occurs to me that, while the original novel barely, if at all, touched upon the moral aspect of the story, the various adaptations have all created their own frameworks to give the story a moral theme of some sort. In the original '74 film, it was the idea of Ratchett being put on 'trial' by 'twelve' conspirators. In the Suchet version, they leaned heavily into Poirot's Catholicism and how it influences his perception of right and wrong. Here the emphasis was also on Poirot's perception of right and wrong, albeit from a less religious perspective, and more from a point of view of 'perfection', and whether it can ever be achieved when it comes to justice.] (#spoiler) Personally, I found this film's handling of Poirot's feelings about the decision he had to make a welcome middle-ground between the original film's cavalier attitude towards the ending and the overly angst-ridden interpretation in the Suchet episode. I particularly liked [the 'test of character' Poirot administered on the suspects in the end...as predictable as it was. It shows that he did base his final decision on some due consideration on the moral complexities of the case.] (#spoiler)

-Two smaller peeves that didn't ruin the film for me but just bugged me. One was [Poirot's lover in the photograph, who didn't at all exist in the books, and had zero relevance to the plot.] (#spoiler) The other was [Poirot having been in touch with Colonel Armstrong before the latter's death. Yes, the payoff with Poirot writing the letter replying to the Colonel in the end was suitably poetic - but if you really examine this subplot, it just seems to come out of nowhere (which is true enough). Isn't it *too* much of a coincidence that the detective the group avenging Daisy Armstrong comes up against is the same one who her father tried to hire years earlier?] (#spoiler)

On the whole, a decent enough adaptation that certainly kept me entertained...even had a bit of a wow factor for me. But certainly not among the greatest of Christie adaptations.",0

26220,"I visited this thread after I watched the film and I've been enjoying much of all those insightful comments from you (e.g. I totally missed the foreshadowing in a comment that said the maid eats food enough for two persons).

And I noticed several people seem to be curious of the reason why the children of Mr. Kim failed to enter a prestigious university, so I'd like to share my thoughts on this matter, as I hope I might be able to give a new perspective as a Korean myself.

In South Korea, the competition among the high school students to get into a good college/university is quite brutal, so much as to make several of them to commit suicide each year after the entrance exam season.

As such, it's often the case that it's not just the student but his or her whole family is involved in the competition and needless to say, more affluent families tend to enjoy a clear advantage over the others which are less well-off.

A glimpse of this phenomenon could be seen from how both of the children of the Kim family are involved as private tutors for the children of the Parks, even though they are still quite young to worry about the colledge entrance exam.

In South Korea, children of a wealthy family often get all kinds of support (e.g. expensive private tutoring, studying abroad to learn English, and so on) from an early age which helps them getting ahead of others from poorer families by allowing a higher chance of getting better education and a better paying job, thus effectively making the gap between the wealthy and the poor a permanent one.

I believe this could be one of the many aspects of 'the line', which metapor being repeatedly used in the film to make its audiences to acknowledge that it's not really individual morals or personalities of either Mr. Kims or Mr. Parks that do matter, but it's such a line that system has drawn between the rich and the poor that constantly forcing each of them in a crash course, and make them lose their humanity in different, respective manners (e.g. becoming a criminal vs becoming insensitive/ignorant of the sufferings of the lower class).

That was how I interpreted that particular aspect of this film.",1

I was getting into it during the second act when the actual papers part of the story came into play and the journalists doing their job came into play, but they stretched the good parts way too thin over the entire runtime and filled it in with dramatized historical fiction tropes. 

The movie ended up becoming so cheesy in the end, where everybody not on Bradlee's side was a cookie-cutter bad guy. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge proponent of journalism (having been one myself professionally), but I hate the pat-on-the-back style movies where it's set up so smugly. Hindsight is 20/20, and the legal threats were very serious. Journalism is never cut and dry, and there's always doubts about doing the right thing, which I don't think they handled as well as movies like All the President's Men and Spotlight did. It's why the Newsroom grated on me so much.

Not to mention, they through in way too many cheesy moments, especially at the end, to the point where they were treating the viewer as dumb. ""Oh hey, just in case you can't tell you're the protagonist, we're going to have an aide for the opposite side of the court case come tell you she believes in you and you made the right decision."" ""Oh hey, in case you didn't realize the significance of a woman in power making a decision and getting a major victory against men, let's throw in a bunch of women clapping close up after the fact."" I was able to understand that fine without the cheese factor, thank you.

Also, John Williams' score was way too cheesy.

I do agree that they share some basic plot similarities but there is a huge difference between plot and story. The story John Wick tells is very much a revenge driven fantasy. The story Pig tells is way more introspective and focused on the actual feelings one reckons with when a loved one is gone.

If anything, Pig fully subverts the vengeance wish fulfillment fantasy that audiences have come to expect from films like this, which pushes it even further away from Wick territory.",0

Maybe I need to chew on it for awhile, but it might suck to say as a cinephile that his movies aren't my taste with exceptions to Boogie Nights, Punch drunk love, and There will be Blood. 

I was actually rooting for the leads to breakup and leave their separate ways, so the ending didn't really come off as sweet or emotional to me. As a montage of scenes and moments, their great on their own, but it never really came together for me.

The pressure to be perfect, to the point of suppressing your true self and doing things you don’t want for the sake of your family. The self-doubt that comes from having to live up to the achievements of the rest of your family. Literally right before this movie, I had dinner with my friend where we talked about her boyfriend (both Asian as well) and his relationship with his mother and her high expectations and how  “he would never be good enough for her” — a sentiment that was also expressed in this movie.

She woke up and what did she said to Chiron? ""You don't love me no more..."" that's a bloody hurtful thing to say to someone who is doing the exact opposite thing. 

If /r/raisedbynarcissists gave their advice they'd say that he should've just her cut off completely and never look back, she's poison. I thought Chiron will never forgive Paula when he hung up on her the first time she called him... He listened to her voice message, and before the call with Kevin the first time he said something along the lines of ""ma I'll come see you tomorrow, I promise"". That implies that they may had more than one conversation on the phone... He still couldn't cut her out completely. 

And yeah, he still met her at the rehab, and still he talked to her respectfully... His mom said something along the lines of ""you don't have to love me, I know that because I knew I never gave you the love you needed. But I want you to know I love you.""

I think I would've liked it more had I been more interested in trying to figure it all out from the get-go, but I did find myself pretty bored for most of it once I realized this was just gonna stay pretty bizarre throughout. 

I like the idea that the woman is just imagined by Jake and he's just placing her in different situations in his life like a science experiment, imagining how his parents would act, what they would talk about on the drive, etc. Explains her clothes and what she's studying changing constantly, as well as how he can seemingly read her thoughts and always conveniently interrupts her as she's about to say ""I'm thinking of ending things."". As it all goes wild in the end, it's as if his idealization is crashing down on itself as he follows it to its logical conclusion. Does that make any sense or am I just being deliberately obtuse? I don't know.

I'm not a huge film buff, and the only other movie of Kaufman's that I've seen is Being John Malkovich (which I loved), so I just felt pretty outta my depth watching this.

Despite enjoying the film, I was buying into the common complaint thrown at it that (due to the anthology nature) it lacked the emotion of Anderson's previous films. But jeez, that last segment with Roebuck hit me like a goddamn train, proving me quite wrong.

His moment with the chef that he deemed ""too sad"" and his explanation for why he loved the dining experience were honestly beautiful in how it portrayed what it was like being alone in a foreign place (not to mention the extra layers of his homosexuality and race), and finding comfort in the place one might least expect.

I see evidence of both since Susie seems like a naive and vulnerable girl in the beginning of the film.  But, her mother also repents on her death bed for her youngest daughter which makes it seem like there was some witchy shenanigans going on back home in Ohio.    

Also it was pretty early on that she walked into the back room and found the bewitched police inspector and she didn't seem all that bothered by it so that is probably more evidence that she was always more than what she seemed.  ",0

27701,"In the final scenes of the movie, when Jojo is flipping through his book, one of the pages is illustrated with a key and a caged rabbit. After seeing the page, Jojo decided to free Elsa, so arguably the caged rabbit symbolized Elsa. The beginning of camp showed that Jojo was not capable of killing a rabbit,  foreshadowing his inability to betray Elsa.

However, the film is called ""Jojo Rabbit,"" Jojo had been ridiculed as JoJo the rabbit, and even the imaginary Hitler friend tells Jojo to embrace his identity as a ""rabbit."" What I took away from the movie is that the rabbit symbolized childhood innocence, full of friendship and love.

Jojo is only 10, and despite his efforts in trying to be a Nazi, his innocence prevents him from killing the rabbit. His imaginary Hitler friend, although at times supportive, is corrupting Jojo's innocence; he is told that the rabbit is cunning and vengeful. Jojo doesn't know how to tie his shoelaces (a process in which Rosie described as making rabbit ears), a skill expected from a child at his age.

When Jojo witnesses the death of Rosie, he tries to tie her shoelaces, but couldn't. Only in the final scenes, when Jojo decides to free Elsa, and evicts imaginary Hitler from his mind, does he bend down and tie Elsa's shoelaces. Jojo embraces his childhood innocence and shares it with Elsa.",1

Two absolutely unnecessary action scenes are added. They don't hurt the story overall but they feel like something that somebody thought they HAD to have or the audience would get bored so they forced them in.

There are a couple other changes to the story that either don't hurt it or actually end up benefiting it:

- The change from a blizzard to an avalanche isn't much different and it allows for the characters to go outside instead of just spending the whole movie on the train.

- Dr. Constantine is excluded from the movie but his character and role are split between a couple other characters so nothing is lost there.

40256,"I thought it almost worked in spite of itself.

My favorite moments were whenever Queen was playing/singing. Queen is my second favorite band (Beatles) of all time so any chance to hear them in a theater was delightful. 

Recreating LIVE AID in its entirety was sublime.

The foursome actors all did a good job conveying their respective musicians. The men playing Brian May and John Deacon in particular were spot on. I loved the running gag of Deac' being the butt of the jokes. 

But the actual ""movie"" in this movie was really lacking.  The whole thing felt stale and safe, moving from moment to moment without any real sense of urgency or excitement. 

As to the historical inaccuracies, there were a ton, but they break down into two different categories for me.

On the one hand are the simple timeline mixups, like Queen developing We Will Rock You far later than actually happened, and Fat Bottomed Girls coming years before it was recorded. 

On the other side are the changes that actually affect the ""story"" of the band; their history. In that case, the biggest sin of the movie was making Freddie the villain of the band during the middle act. 

According to the movie, Freddie got swept up by Paul Prenter and decided to go solo, leaving the rest of the band to go without him. After coming to his senses he returns to the group and begs them to take him back and let him record with them again. They do and this coincides with LIVE AID and the band's miraculous ""comeback.""

Yeah, but no:

Queen never stopped recording. They recorded together from the time they formed to the day Freddie died (and beyond, with the surviving trio recording a swan song album with some old Freddie recordings). Yes Freddie released a solo album but so did the rest of them...BEFORE Freddie. 

And then there's Mercury's personal life. The movie would have us believe that Freddie was a wild drug and sex-addicted hedonist. And of course, he absolutely was...but so was the rest of them.

Well, maybe not John Deacon.

Brian May was arguably more sex-addicted than Freddie. The man wrote Fat Bottomed Girls from personal experience for crying out loud. But in the movie the trio are all family men who don't have time for Freddie's partying ways. 

And it's fine if the movie wants to take liberties. It's a film, not a documentary. But in that case let's not call it a ""biopic."" The bio(graphy) part has been cast aside in order to concoct a narrative that the writer and surviving band members thought would be more cinematic.

And therein lies my biggest problem. The movie was made without Freddie's input, obviously. John Deacon has been retired for twenty-five years (not coincidentally he's the aforementioned butt of the jokes) and Freddie's been dead for almost thirty.

Brian and Roger carry on, however, and they were the creative gurus on the film. Not coincidentally, they come off the best. Roger is witty and Brian is measured, meanwhile Deacon's a dork and Freddie a self-destructive time bomb. It just rubs me the wrong way that Freddie wasn't there to say ""hey that's not how it went down...""

For a band that, in their final years, decided to credit themselves as a group on all their songs, it's sad to see such a slanted view on screen, slanted in favor of two of the four.

But the music is great, I can't deny it.

As to the direction, Brian Singer was infamously fired for failing to show up to work(!) but his name is kept on the credits due to DGA regulations. Despite not finishing the movie, the film retains his fingerprints. There are flashes of cleverness---a cutesy angle or an interesting camera trick---that stick out from the sea of blandness. There's little else to say about it. 

From a filmmaking standpoint, I'm far more intrigued by the Elton John movie, ROCKETMAN, coming next year. That looks like the anti-biopic, mixing in elements of fantasy and the surreal. The music should be great too; like Queen, Elton John has a great catalogue of hits to pull from and a wild ride of a life to put on screen.

I just hope they don't turn him into a villain in his own movie the way this one did.",1

I could tell the animators put in a ton of time to make their characters as detailed as possible in the movie posters and trailers but in the movie they take it even further. Even tiny stuff like Mr. Otterton's graying hairs, the various canines' nosepads, or even stuff like when Nick was playing around with Bellwether's hair, the movie is just bleeding with fine-combed detail. Not easy when you have just about every single kind of mammal represented.

Even then the locale and huge range of scale within the city of Zootopia is amazing, especially since the vast majority of the film is done on Judy's and Nick's level so people like elephants or Bogo all the way down to hamsters gives the feel of such an impressive scope to everything around them. Even cooler to see how Zootopia accommodates everyone due to that fact.

As everyone else has already said, the characters feel real in their personality, the story is a little cliche but well executed, and overall it's a solid film.

37339,"I remember seeing one of those ""behind the music"" type documentaries on the making of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", but apart from that I didn't really know a lot about Elton John.

I knew his name was Reggie... something, when he came out as gay everyone was like ""no durr"", he was in giant shoes in Tommy, and that was one of his least flamboyant outfits, he at least used to hate his mum, and re-wrote Marilyn Munro's song for Princess Di.

I did really enjoy the movie, and Taron Egerton knocked it out of Dodger's Stadium with his performance and singing.  Apparently Elton John wanted Justin Timberlake to take the role.  I think that could have worked really well, but anyway.

The film really felt like it was set in it's time period, and inclusions of fairly faithful renditions of characters like Dick James really built the world.

With Elton John being so closely involved in the story, he didn't stray too much into the making himself look great.  I wouldn't call it ""warts and all"", maybe ""tarnish and all"".  This is most obvious in the complete glossing over of his marriage to... that woman... Renate Blauel

A full on gay sex scene in a major Hollywood film is a refreshing break.  Good on them for showing it.

Where the movie kind of fell flat was that it was ""too real"".  There were complaints about ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" for not being accurate to real life.  Here's the thing.  Real life doesn't often make for real good story telling.

Why did Zemo send the Zimmerman telegram even though that was completely contrary to their goals? Where even did the final fight take place? Sure as hell wasn’t Scotland but they never said where his secret barn lair was.

I also felt that they didn’t utilize the time period very well.

The other kingsmen movies got bonkers, I would have loved to have seen them battle on top of a zeppelin about to blow up the queens palace or something. This movie doesn’t care about any other historical accuracies or details, so why not.

- they cut a heart to heart scene between Peter and Miles that happened on a roof - I believe it occurs after Aaron dies but its been awhile so I could be getting the timing wrong. For the life of me I don’t remember exactly what they were saying but I remember being moved by this scene so I was very upset they cut it. It actually kind of affected my viewing experience this time around because I kept waiting for it to come on. I’m pretty sure peter was apologizing for being a shitty teacher and ruminating on his mistakes with MJ but it’s pretty fuzzy in my memory. (Edit: someone in the comments reminded me that this is the scene where Peter says “you don’t have to save the whole world, just focus on saving one person”)

- they also cut a lot out of the sequence where the spider crew sneaks into fisks gala. You know the line where they go “it can’t be that easy”? Yeah, the joke in the test screening was it WASNT that easy because the henchmen basically immediately realize who they are and say something to the effect of “do you think we’re stupid or something? Obviously we’re not gonna fall for the fact that y’all are waiters” I can’t really remember how they end up escaping - miles may have rescued them? I honestly can’t remember though since it’s been so long. 

- Peter porker had a lot of his best lines cut which I was DEVASTATED about because they were some of my favorite parts. There’s a scene where he talks about one of his family members dying and he describes the smell as singed bacon. It’s hard to describe but the shock factor of that line was sooo hysterical. He also says fuck at one point, but it pops up as a bunch of “f*^%#!” symbols in the speech bubble that appears so it’s just implied. 

- the end scene where adult Peter reconnects with MJ wasn’t there, in the test screening I saw it just shows him calling her at the very end. I like this change a lot better because it’s a more satisfying resolution for him. 

- in my test screening almost the entire climax was in storyboards so there’s a ton of stuff they changed from that - but it’s way too many random little things for me to remember. 

If I remember anything else I’ll update this. And if anyone else was in a test screening and remembers that Peter/ Miles scene on the roof, please let me know because it’s killing me that I can’t remember exactly when that scene took place. ",0

24548,"I feel like they *did* repeat a lot of twists for the second movie and in so doing they have created a formula.  Simply put, the formula is that in the 3rd movie, the “girl next door” will trade places with the “babysitter” so that while she appeared entirely evil in movie #2 she can find redemption at the end of #3 while the “manic pixie” girl from movie #2 takes over the villain role for movie #3.  The “manic pixie’s” deal with the devil will likewise not be revealed until movie #4, allowing her to redeem herself then.   Meanwhile they shuffle in a new love interest for Cole and do their damnedest to make you think there is no way she could be a satanic cult leader.

Felt like Wright and Cairns didn’t know what their message was by the end though. Or that they were trying to juggle multiple themes and couldn’t stick all the landings. The criticism on how we fetishize the past was great. 

But the film spent the first two acts highlighting the plights that women faced in the 1960s and the struggles within an abusive relationship. And then cheapened the strongest character’s arc by turning her into a serial killer. In a different movie with a different first two acts, maybe that plot would have worked.

28794,"So I finally watched the movie and I'd like to share my opinion, even if it might be unpopular. I really, really did not like it. So many things are wrong with it. 

Let's start with Amy. Oh my god, do I even need to say it. When a girl who is supposed to be 12 in the early parts of the book looks older than all of her sisters and sounds like an adult woman with a low, slightly hoarse voice, that just doesn't work. She doesn't seem to show any emotions other then sulking and disapproving, her apology to Jo after she burns the book is so far from sencere that I wouldn't forgive her even after the near drowning. She looks out of place at school and she's just not a good fit to play young Amy. Maybe if she was at least voiced by a different actress in her young years that would not sound so off-putting, but as it is I winced every time she spoke in the ""past"" bits of the film. 

Jo. Why is she nearly blond?? Jo is supposed to be brown haired. Otherwise not terrible.

Why does Meg look younger than all of her sisters other than Beth? She's supposed to be the oldest... She definitely doesn't give a sense of a girl who is trying to act like an older sister. Generally her character wasn't developed at all, I wouldn't see anything more than a pretty girl in the film character if I haven't read the book and didn't know what she's supposed to be. Very flat, shallow portrayal of a character. 

Mrs March, I didn't like her at all either. She didn't give the impression of a warm, calm, cosy and strong mother of a family. She just looks like a hectic, slightly hysterical woman. And ginger for some reason... 

I was disappointed with the portrayal of the scene of Beth's illness. For me, in the book this is one of the most powerful moments, when they wait, at night, when the doctor said that if she makes it through the night, she'll live... Laurie's sudden announcement that their mother is coming, that he sent for her. The tension of the wait, Laurie disappearing to fetch their mother, the dawn, the arrival of their mother, Beth finally sleeping peacefully. It always gave me goosebumps. Here they just brushed over it... Blended it into the story of Beth's death. 

I didn't like the patchiness of jumping back and forward in time. I didn't like the casting for the most part. The ending takes away some of the atmosphere by being too obvious and too dramatic. Overall, this is definitely not my thing... 

From the good/ok parts - Laurie was ok, Meryl Streep is amazing as always but there isn't a lot of her so it doesn't save the film. The atmosphere of the time was recreated well, beautiful costumes, nice music.",1

I'm surprised that the movie did this well on a Reddit community poll. And I'm someone who considers the movie in a favorable light. I gave it a 7/10 (good, not great) and wasn't expecting to see it hit an 8 for Mean and Median, and 10 for mode.

I generally liked it and was glad to have gone see it. But with all the controversy over the historical revisionism of P.T. Barnum and accusations of the movie's songs being a bit on the bland/uninspired (it's true, there are better musicals out there with better songs), it's still a little surprising.

I'm glad some people really enjoyed it and hopefully Hugh Jackman knows that. I get what the critics have an issue with when they say that P.T. Barnum was probably not the most deserving person to have a musical made after them. At the same time, I think no-one was honestly expecting this to be a faithful biographical recount of Barnum's life. That certainly wasn't the expectation I had going in, and I only saw the trailers, I didn't do much reading into the real-life Barnum until after I saw the movie.

I saw an interesting suggestion in a comment thread here on Reddit (not sure if it was this megathread) where someone suggested they should have ditched the ""based on a true story/real person"" fictionalized biography gimmick and just made up a story about a man who gets fame and glory from creating a circus for the ""outcasts"" of society, maybe with some inspirations from real-life but nothing explicitly based on a single person like P.T. Barnum. That probably would have been a better to approach the creation of this film, from a narrative-construction and story-telling point of view.

This being said, I'm trying not to hold it against the movie too much because it's clearly stylized. Though it seems like such an easy fix, if they had just called the main character ""B.T. Farnum"" or something like that, then all the criticisms of the accuracy of the story go away and it would have freed up some creative potential. I think most people who liked it, didn't really give a shit that it was about P.T. Barnum, they liked the ensemble of characters, and the themes and arc of the story.

My negative digs at this movie:

* Odd pacing, but it's a musical where all the big plot points have to happen in 5-minute song and choreographed dance performances, so I guess that kind of comes with the genre.

* It's short. I guess it didn't bother me that much, the story didn't feel like it was dragging on but at the same time you sort of get to the end and go ""Oh... that's it? Ok then.""

* Would have liked a bit more of a real down-turn for the Barnum character. There's moments in the movie where his character is at a low point, but (and maybe this is also an issue with lighting and the stage set), they they never really *felt* like it. I know it's not meant to be a dour film but I would have liked a little more sadness or despair(?) to even out the happy, peppy, high points. And Jackman can do it, it's just that the script and the way it was shot didn't really seem to emphasize the point, they just briefly dwell on it and then quickly move on.

* Would have liked better development of the ensemble cast of characters. At least one song for every one of the main ones. The film is a little bit lop-sided in this regard.

* Passage of time, maybe? It felt a little bit weird that it appears the main events of the movie take place in about a year, with no discernible passage of time. His daughters are roughly the same age as when he began the circus, as when he ""retires"" from it and passes the baton to Philip.",0

I work with the homeless, including some families and people who, like Halley, make poor choices again and again. There are many reasons the make those choices, the most common being having few life skills because of the ways they were raised. A history of extreme abuse and neglect can make one constitutionally unable to care for oneself, let alone a child. People also have untreated mental illness, history of head injury, even low IQ/ cognitive delay. I feel like ALL of my patients who are chronically homeless (and living in a motel counts as homeless) have at least one, sometimes all, of these challenges.

Some people are hardwired to rise above a rough childhood, others aren’t born that way. There’s no obvious reason why sometimes.

I think it’s important to see that the mom, for all her flaws, loved and protected her daughter. Halley was careless, but she was also fun, sweet, and took real pleasure in Moonee. She was a good a mother, and as good as she could be. That doesn’t mean that Moonee shouldn’t have been removed. That is the tragedy.

24973,"Throughout the entire movie, there was this one thought niggling at me. Usually in a movie that’s a thriller or psychological horror, there is always the voice of reason. There is always something bizarre and unsettling happening, but there is always a character(s) who voices and acts as the person the viewer relates to. In ‘Get Out’ it was Kaluya’s character who knows from the beginning that there’s something unsettling about it all. In ‘Midsommar’, Pugh’s character is thoroughly freaked out initially.

But in this movie, ‘Lucy’ seemed to be just as complicit in the weirdness of the narrative as the rest of them; Jake, his parents, etc. You can tell that she’s nervous, but she’s never entirely surprised. Even when the mother gets nervous ticks during their dinnertime conversation, even when the old version of his father hands her a nightgown with a stain on it, even when she sees her supposed paintings on the wall in the basement. She’s low-key weirded out, but never stunned or shocked. 

Then I realised that this all comes from inside a single head. She _is_ complicit in the weirdness of her narrative.

Also, Jake’s mother seemed like someone who neglected and constantly mocked him for his low intelligence, who he gets back at, in his fantasy in which she obsessively makes comments about what a ‘good boy’ Jake is and about his diligence pin.

48989,"Who was the third robber? Does it matter? For a second I thought they would reveal it to be Miles Miller  but we never got an explanation.

&#x200B;

Timeline doesn't really make sense but reasons I thought it was going to be Miles.

&#x200B;

1. Miles thought he knew the priest from somewhere in the beginning of the film. But Bridges said ""no"", maybe they didn't know each other by face during the robbery maybe just had masks and Jeff knew Nick because he was the brother.
2. When Nick gets killed, right at the beginning of the movie, it may have been filmed. Miles works at the El Royale because management has dirt on him. Why wouldn't he just leave that shitty job right? Maybe he was the third robber and they have evidence of him killing Nick and are forcing him to work there?  He doesn't know where the money is because he didn't know the contingency plan?
3. Maybe management didn't have dirt on him, but he works there in hopes to discover the lost money.
4. I thought ""the Kid"" in the mask looked a lot like Miles.

Number 2. messes up the timeline of the movie, because Miles was in Vietnam which means he would have first killed Nick then gone to Vietnam. If management had dirt on him they would've employed him from the start (or maybe he was drafted and forced to go).

\- Carey Mulligan flinching when Alfred Molina made sudden movements toward her - god knows how many dangerous situations Cassie had been in with other men, I thought that was a realistic reaction

\- Ryan calling Cassie a ""stupid bitch"" when telling her he loved her was a little jarring on first viewing, even as a cute lil joke... Made total sense in retrospect. Comments like that made by men, even when unintentional, even when packaged in a cute way, give affirmation to misogynists. Just like the character of Ryan as whole. Ofc women and queer folk have reclaimed words like bitch and slut for themselves, but I can't really get behind straight men saying them. Until they become fully gender-neutral terms, at least.

\- Alison Brie bordering on breaking the fourth wall while walking into Cassie's parents Weirdly Baroque sitting room. Seems like production just wanted to shoot on a cool-looking set and was like, fuck it, we don't need to explain it",1

So I was in a really small theater and directly in front of me was a mom and her probably 13 year old son. As the previews began they started going back and forth arguing because the son wanted to get popcorn and the mom was telling him no. This went on for what seemed like 5 straight minutes as he kept persisting and it got to the point where she just goes, “I will drag you out of this theater right now if you don’t stop and watch the movie.” Needless to say he was pissed but finally gave up when the movie started and I just laughed to myself.

Fast forward to the end of the movie, and we obviously just sat through this very deep and emotional story centering around a close mother-son relationship. As soon as the closing credits started rolling, I look down and see the boy leaned over tightly hugging his mom. 

It was a small thing to witness, but I just found it really touching to see how the story clearly moved this boy.",1

Something I wanted to talk about was this movie's effortless case for why Representation matters. I talked about this with someone after watching, but have you ever seen a movie where there was a big dinner table scene that featured a bunch of people just talking in sign language? Those scenes in particular I found to be quite beautiful in their modesty. I loved the scenes with the deaf community -- both with the kids at the school and the adults at the house. So many moving & incredibly powerful moments. This cast also was quite racially diverse, too, I must say, with of course the lead of this movie being Pakistani.

Representation matters. Diverse opinions and diverse groups could lead to some diverse & incredible storytelling. Sound of Metal is a clear result of that. Bravo to Darius Marder and team.",1

The ending of the movie was so perfect, anyone could wear the mask.

But I have to say I did not find that to be the case. Perhaps my expectations were lowered because of the discussion surrounding the film but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Sure the stakes are lower and its not pushing any boundaries creatively like Inside Out or Soul but its much closer to Pixar’s usual quality than something like Good Dinosaur.

The lighthearted, warm kids story with a strong message worked really well and the smaller scale and stakes made it much more relatable and whimsical to me.

Some of the comparisons to Call Me By Your Name are fair but to its strength I think.

I cannot gush about this film enough, as I've already seen it twice. It managed to find the perfect balance of switching between making me laugh and making me cry between the scenes. Most noticeable example: THAT scene followed by Sam Rockwell dancing to ABBA. Because that's just how life goes. No big emotional send off, just life going on. Not to mention that Sam Rockwell has one of the best character arcs that I've seen in a long time. I just loved how everyone was just in this morally gray area (except for maybe Woody Harrelson's character who I initially thought was going to be a total dick.) 

But my absolute favorite scene: Mildred falling to her knees as she tries to put out the fires. It felt very Sisphyian but it solidified what her ex had told her earlier in the film how the billboards wouldn't bring back her daughter.

This is all gossip column speculation, but it's just... I don't know. PTA said he was inspired to write this story while he was bed-ridden and his wife, Maya Rudolph, took care of him to an almost Annie Wilkes degree, and while that's probably true, I suspect Apple's got some sort of role in this movie.

After all, in *Rebecca*, on which *Phantom* is loosely inspired, both the movie by Hitchcock and the novel by Daphne du Maurier (if you read it, you will find SO many lines, phrases, and overall similarities to the whole of *Phantom Thread*), the second wife of Mr. Maxim de Winters is haunted by memories of his first wife Rebecca, just how Reynolds Woodcock compares Alma to his mother and previous lover.

But in the end, I think the movie is about closure. Not just with Daniel Day-Lewis' retirement (I doubt it), but how Reynolds and Alma end up settling themselves in their own unique situation.

She fondly describes him as tender and like a baby.](#spoiler)

[For me, the ""Phantom"" refers to the figurative ghost of Reynolds mother. And the ""Thread"" is how that relationship now ties Alma and Reynolds together. He wants to be infantalized and cared for. She wants to mother and care for this weakened being who can be so harsh, distant and overwhelming in normal life.](#spoiler)

The phrase ""carry your cross"" is not meant to be taken literally (and can be interpreted in different ways by different christian circles) -- but essentially, it means to suffer, deal with your burdens, figure out your problems, etc. I thought that showing Paul carrying a literal cross was to demonstrate how he worships on Sundays in his own way, and to possibly foreshadow that the Yi's were about to suffer (more). ",1

Atleast John wick had Avant Garde Action Spectacle that offset the basic script and motivations. This film kinda wanted to be that John Wick Action and be 'something more' with the Family/Self Respect angle, but in the end it ditched both those objectives it seems. Those goofy talking to dying people explaining his expostion was so ffffking lazy.

Part of the spectacle is how Lee chose to film the show: there are some cool weird angles and unexpected zooms that really complement the whole thing.

Even the climactic victory of getting a suffrage vote passed had to be done by proxy, via the Viscount. Empowerment takes more than just a can-do attitude, it requires real systematic change.

His dad is gone, he needs/wants something to replace that person. So he's picked the most important person in the country, unforunately shitler has some pretty shit opinions, but when you have that unformed worldview like you mention, you end up taking on the beliefs of you parental figures.

So with hitler as the substitute father figure, he ends up buying into beliefs that would make hitler happy. Because he want's to make his father happy.

And without anything to make him question those beliefs, he has no reason to push back against his father figure in the way a boy might. But as he develops his interactions with Elsa, there is a greater separation between him and his hitler father figure.

There was some dolly shots that were great very fluid and not distracting. For a director known for amazing camera moves, it's fascinating how Cuaron brought life through framing and blocking rather than crazy camera moves.

It reminded me a lot of one of my favorites of all time Andrei Rublev, which often has these insane scenes of violence or insanity with very little camera movement. I definitely think it was a purposeful rule for Cuaron (who was his own DP, that show off) and it creates this excellent ghostly, observational feeling to the whole thing. Just so well done.

Also how did he make a dolly shot that went OVER the ocean?! It's crazy enough to build a dolly on sand but holy shit.

14662,"What I find really interesting about the movie, and what I keep thinking about, is considering whether or not what she learns is actually beneficial for her. She learns to let go of her possessions and attachments - both lessons that can be seen as positive. But she does so by isolating herself from people who care about her, hurting them in the process and reinforcing her internal narrative that she is independent and doesn’t need anyone. Meanwhile the film shows us over and over again that we need other people in our lives or we’ll get lost - quite literally in the scene where Ferg goes out in the rocks and Dave has to find her and bring her back. Ferg is frequently relying on the goodwill of others to get by (and in turn helping others as well). 

She’s able to finally deal with her grief, but I’m not sure if she’s learned to live in the present. I’d argue she’s afraid to live in the moment and instead runs from it. Menial labor, traveling, and survival are distractions she gives herself so that she doesn’t have to deal with herself as a person, her own flaws, and the difficulty she has maintaining meaningful relationships. I think there’s an argument that this movie glorifies the nomadic lifestyle, but I actually think it does the opposite. It really shows how isolating it can be, and I think that, like Dave, she’d ultimately have been happier if she settled down surrounded by people who loved and cared about her. It would be harder for her, and she’d have to put real, emotional work into it in order for it to work out, but she’d be happier for it.",1

6906,"This is what I found interesting, a plot leak from like January:

>James Bond and Madeline Swann are attacked by SPECTRE during their honeymoon in Italy. Bond thinks Madeline betrayed him and leaves her.

>Five years later, Bond is recruited by Felix Leiter and his partner Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen) to help the CIA rescue a scientist from SPECTRE in Cuba.

>Bond meets MI6 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch), who replaced him as 007.

>Bond and CIA agent Paloma (Ana de Armas), Felix's protege, rescue the scientist from a SPECTRE gathering.

>Ash betrays them, kills Felix and Paloma and attempts to leave with the scientist, but Nomi rescues him.

>Bond rejoins the MI6 to avenge Felix and Paloma and learns that Madeline is working for them, and that they have a daughter, Mathilde.

>Bond interrogates Blofeld, who reveals that SPECTRE’s new leader Safin (Rami Malek) is obsessed with
Madeline and wants to use a bioweapon made by the scientist to wipe out the human race.

>Ash kidnaps Madeline and Mathilde and take them to Safin's lair on a private island so they will survive his purge.

>Blofeld helps them find the island. Bond and Nomi join forces to infiltrate it in the stealth plane.

>Safin killed Madeleine's mother when she was a child in a failed attempt to kill her father, Mr. White, and young Madeleine shot him.

>Safin saved young Madeleine after she fell into a frozen lake trying to escape and has been obsessed with her ever since.

>Safin has used genetic engineering to maintain his youth, and now plans to use it to reshape humanity to his image.

>Bond disables the bioweapon and kills Safin while Nomi kills Ash and rescues Madeline and Mathilde.

>The four escape as Safin’s lair explodes, and Bond retires to be with his family while Nomi returns to the MI6 as the new 007.

Interestingly it gives a bit of explanation for how Safin looks young (which I found interesting) and some motivation (even if it's weak). I'm fairly sure this may have been an earlier cut of the film or something. It's too accurate. Interesting that they didn't plan to kill Bond at that point.",0

Though the head of *Grewishka* (I mean the ape-like one who gets a fist to the eye) looks fuzzy, like a Gears of War character (the first game).

2 hours is a longish movie. Yet it felt rushed, like a too-closely-edited teaser, and a montage at times, with still reflective moments cut short - even the music seemed cut! At the same time, threads are unfinished. Testament to the source material, I guess!

Overall, great graphics, great characters, great story - but justice wasn't done to them. Maybe Jim can remake it after Avatar *n*.

EDIT it feels like it was edited for length, so a director's cut could be good. Unfortunately, because CG is so expensive, probably most of the cuts weren't fully rendered, so it wouldn't be straightforward.

The script is incredible. I read the short story it was based on when the anthology came out and it left little impression on me but this film manages to flesh it out so well. And it's such a wonderful acting showcase. Takatsuki's monologue in the car might be the single best piece of acting I've seen all year. I'm really glad I caught this one in a cinema where I could just sit and allow the narrative to watch over me instead of pausing and getting up to get something or check my phone like I often do at home. And I barely felt the length. I was just along for the ride. I really loved the Korean couple. The scene with the two actresses in the park is also a highlight. So moving and emotional. 

I will say that I found the cathartic scene at the house to be the only stumble for me. After being quite spare and understated, the dialogue suddenly becomes very heavy-handed in a way that I found clunky and unnecessary and the acting doesn't quite carry it off either. But outside of that, it's pretty much perfect.",1

53310,"I loved this movie. One thing that stood out for me in this film was how realistic the dogfights were.

Here are a few details that I loved about the air sequences: 

- The aircraft didn't shoot 100% accurate laser rounds that cause planes to explode violently after one hit. Also they were firing in short bursts. Finally a dogfight in cinema where pilots are actually being cautious with their ammo consumption. Similarly monitoring things like fuel, manifold pressure and engine.

- The difficulty to get guns on target was so well portrayed. It took patience and skill to get those rounds to hit and it really showed in these dogfights. 

- The maneuverability of the aircraft was realistic. You could see them pulling G's and the planes weren't turning on a dime (even though they are Spits) or doing aileron rolls every 3 secs.

- The sounds of the aircraft in flight was phenomenal. I have been in a warbird myself and immediately recognized some sounds. Things like the prop stutter and the creaking and shaking metal. These are small details but don't go unnoticed and really add to the feeling of being right there in the cockpit with these guys.

There were some stellar shots and sequences (when Hamm's character first discovers the hidden windows, with Erivo's vocals in the background, that was truly spectacular).  Loved the usage of character's reflections in the mirrors, both their own and when somebody was looking through to the other side, that was extremely effective.  Visually stunning use of sets and colors and costumes.  The end didn't drag as much for me as it did for others.  I definitely get the Tarantino influence but that's what I felt it was...an influence rather than copying...Goddard used flashbacks and dialogue heavily just like QT but made it his own, and I thought both the dialogues and flashbacks had a lot more heart than Tarantino's which are usually solely for exposition and stylistic choices (and I say that with no disrespect, I am a big fan of Tarantino's work), and his command of some of the more adventurous sequences shows that he has vision of his own.

That's up to your tastes, but I don't think ""it wasn't surprising"" detracts from anything else you praised it for. 

And there were parts I found surprising. The reveal that Danny was gay was edited so nontraditionally, I found it really incredible. They didn't linger in that moment at all, it didn't feel cinematic, they cut it how that moment would feel in real life. That was very interesting to me, and I think the film made lots of interesting choices like that. Maybe you went in too hyped, the 100% RT score and all that. But if every single critic gives something an 8/10, that's a pretty goddamn amazing feat. It's a 9 or a 10 for me, but even so, I think coming out feeling negative about it just because other people felt so positively about it is the wrong way to think about it. ",1

In particular, Rose's monologue (""I been right here with you!"") spoke not only to the sacrifice of marriage in general but actually forced the audience, like Troy, to realize that there just wasn't any consideration of a woman's dreams or desires (above and beyond marriage). You're thinking of the story, the struggle, from Troy's perspective, his lament of his great unfulfilled potential as a result of poverty and marginalization until you're forced to see that, even though Rose bears the same burdens, her personal tragedy isn't as obvious because a woman's potential was simply not considered or valued. I think that Rose's enduring commitment and love made her a living reminder of Troy's 'soft' side and the primary reason that his children could forgive his flaws/failings.  ",1

22774,"I think Nolan is just terrible at writing women with any semblance of traditionally female motivations... they often get the worst lines in his movies. 

Brand’s emotional bit about love in Interstellar springs to mind.  A group of elite scientists, and the one woman on board has to be the one to make the highly emotional argument.  Brand allows her identity as a wife to outweigh her identity as a scientist.  And I GET what Nolan was going for, her monologue is the crux of the message of the movie.  But the way it’s written, and the fact that they made the only female on board deliver it feels like he uses her womanhood as a crutch. She forgoes science for love.

Similarly, Kat’s character identity is largely centered around being a mother.  Her love for her son motivates her. This is a very realistic motivation but clearly Nolan struggled to write her in a way that seemed natural and balanced.  And so we get weird lines where it feels like he wanted to remind the audience that she is a mother who loves her son... yanno, just in case we forgot.",0

I thought the movie was essentially all about .... what I want to say is femininity, for lack of a better word. More like receptivity and the female polarity. Some of the ""facts"" of the movie were so strange -- you could never fill a bathroom with that much water -- but the emotions were so real that to me I didn't feel cheated by the logical questions. It wasn't a logical movie. I thought the ending was great because it just put the whole story in lens of it being a fairy tale. It's not supposed to be a story where the facts make sense. It was about the emotion. I read some of these descriptions and have a way different viewpoint. Eliza wasn't lonely at all -- she was a happy person. The monster wasn't lonely.

But also the bridges in Portland should take it fine, and they've even already made adjustments to some of the bridges to accommodate for the earthquake.

I also loved the ending, beautifully crafted by the director so that the audience realizes what’s happening as the people close to Mr Rogers reflect during that minute, and us in the audience reflect ourselves.

Nobody in my theater stood up immediately. I think it’s because nobody wanted to leave the comfort of Mr Rogers’ neighborhood and go back into the divided world we live in now. But I think this documentary came at a perfect time, because we could all learn a little from Mr Rogers right now.",0

2) Was GWB really like Cheney's puppet? The movie portrays Bush as kind of an idiot and like he's being manipulated by Cheney at many important moments. Was this accurate?

I watched the movie with my girlfriend. The trailer had piqued her interest. Her parents divorced over a decade ago. Both of us were balling all throughout Charlie and Nicole's explosive argument. She said that's what happened with her parents during their tough times but on a daily basis. This movie is good at showing the ugly side of divorce and what happens when the legal system gets involved.

The movie was clearly written by someone who has had an extremely personal experience with divorce. I've liked a lot of Baumbach's films. He just continues to get better.",1

I thought she wrote/directed them perfectly.

I was so pleasantly surprised by it.

Overall it was much better than I anticipated it to be, and even my perceived shortcomings like the lack of actual fighting and morphing so late into the film aren't enough to make me dislike the film in any way.

It was fun, cheesy, and it was wonderful to actually see them really come together. They're all kind of misfits in some way (though Kimberly's backstory was a little weak compared to the rest).

I also really enjoyed the mostly subtle colour coding for each character, like Kimberly using pink-handled scissors, or Trini's dingy yellow beanie.

56269,"I was absolutely blown away to be honest. I had high expectations, and they were exceeded. There were just so many individual elements I absolutely loved, but it still came together to be more than the sum of its parts. It was visually stunning. The score was intense and engaging. The characters were so memorable. Big spoilers ahead. The final fight scene in the waves and the ships was my favourite movie scene of the year so far, it was incredible to watch. The scene of him making love to Joi and the real girl at the same time was completely mesmerising.

My interpretation: I loved the ultimate message of the movie. K was just another replicant, sharing some of the same memories as so many other replicants. But the circumstances of his character, as a detective/officer, were such that he was the first replicant that ever ended up in the same setting as the memory of hiding the horse. He was the first replicant who had the opportunity to test whether the memory was legitimate, by trying to find the horse (which is also why the horse was still there). The ""miracle"" that K ""hasn't witnessed"" (as per the dialogue at the beginning where K retires the replicant in his home) is that a replicant can be born, with a soul. Once K sees this miracle (and believes that he may be the first one) he starts to run and disobey orders. But in the end, he was wrong, he wasn't born and the memory was implanted. But by that point, it didn't matter - just like K, we completely believed that since he was born, he was as human as human could get, and we sympathised with him totally. 

In the end, it didn't matter whether K was a plain old replicant or a ""born replicant"" (human?): the only thing separating K from having a soul, so to speak, was his and the audiences shared *belief* that he was naturally born. He broke the ""wall"" that was spoken about by Robin Wright's character at the beginning, without even knowing it.

The final frame was beautiful, I am so glad they ended it there, and I hope there's not a sequel. The world is so rich and even more developed after watching this that I feel like I spend hours imagining what might happen next, and I love that. I also love that we still don't know whether Deckard is a replicant or not.

I'll be thinking about it for days. Absolutely one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had.

Interesting. The overall feel about the movie starts off less than good. By the time you get to the most recent takes on the film, people are positively raving about the film...

I don’t know. I just thought I’d comment on that.

Oh and...
The one thing about the climate of the conversation in regards to the movie that really sticks out to me is the mention of this being a “black culture cash grab”. I was pretty shocked about that viewpoint. While this is a fabrication of what happened that night and the conversations that could have occurred, I thought the point was one worth making. The point wasn’t to necessarily nail down how these people would have acted with each other that night. I think the point is you have presuppositions about their viewpoints based on having some proof of what their real lives were like through other mediums which, sets the stage for depicting different viewpoints. There’s plenty of people that are superfluously gauging current racial conflicts to have one similar narrative driven particularly by the media (and soaked up by many might I add).  This movie was for people like that (who I admit might not ever watch a move like this). 

My point is the point was not to depict what we think actually happened in some fantasy fanart but to show the nuances of human experience. Notice I didn’t say Black experience. But I think assuming all black folks are going to have a similar take on events occurring right now happens more often than not. And this movie seemed to really flesh out the myriad of ways the Civil Rights Movement affected people and how they perceived the events of the time.",0

It's likely Mickey would be that pissed that Dry Eye approached his wife in any way, not necessarily just because of a sexual assault. 

In either case, the movie has a second layer of unreliability once it's shown Fletcher is pitching a movie to Ritchie. So it's impossible to know how realistic anyone's portrayal is throughout the film if you play by its rules.",0

>Super refreshing to have a smart, capable protagonist in one of these movies.

  
I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but smart and capable isn't what I'd call our protagonist.
  
He had a variety of weapons at his disposal.  He could have used the pop bottles ((un)broken), plate ((un)broken), lid of the toilet or even metal rods from inside the toilet.
  
When The Grabber was sleeping, he could have smashed his skull in with that ceramic toilet lid and then stabbed him with any broken pieces.

37353,"For context, I enjoy Elton John's music quite a bit, but I'm not super knowledgeable about his career or his music beyond the biggest of the hits.  With that in mind I enjoyed this movie a lot.

What I liked: Taron Egerton is great as Elton, and Jamie Bell kills it as Bernie as well.  I hope that the Academy keeps Egerton in mind when Oscar season rolls around, but I don't have a ton of faith that it will. The music was obviously great. I liked the way this movie was stylized in comparison to other music biopics. Slightly petty, but I like that it ended with I'm Still Standing, which has always been my favorite Elton John song.

What I didn't like: I could have used like 10 minutes less of child Elton. And I thought that Elton's mother wasn't written particularly well.  Because of those two things, the emotional beats of the ""forgive yourself"" part at the end didn't really hit for me. 

This was my introduction to quite a few Elton John songs, and one of my big takeaways coming out of the movie was that I wish I had been more familiar with his catalog. Overall it's a 4/5 for me. I think we're going to get a classic rock biopic basically every six months for the foreseeable future, and I thought this was a much better example of the genre than *Bohemian Rhapsody*.",0

We thought it was supposed to be partial commentary on how deaf people experience the world around them without having the same information as hearing people.

> I gotta say, as someone who lived in New England for many years, the landscape felt like a character to me. I know lots of films are shot on location, but there are just so many things that make me feel ""New England"" that I don't find other places. It's a combination of the density of houses, the hills, the foliage, the white salty/grimy windshields, the rocky coastline, the tar patched roads, the angles of the power lines, the frequency of graveyards (although this was also a plot device and not just setting), etc. I really felt the presence of the setting and it really made me feel like the characters were ingrained Massachusetts working class Catholics.

I've lived several other places and have traveled all about the US and that mix of scenery is uniquely New England to me. The landscape shots really helped me identify and understand the characters because I kept feeling like ""I know these people!"" and the people and scenery were all accurate. 

The band scenes were really attention grabbing to me.  I'm not sure if I loved them or hated them.  They definitely made me feel like Patrick is just a sorta shitty (aren't we all at 16?) kid.  It also reminded me that Joe's death wasn't omnipresent for Patrick like death seemed to be for Lee.",1

As a motorsport nerd; it's *pretty* good. Up there with other good motor-racing films (of which there are very few to be fair - Le Mans, Grand Prix, Rush). Sure there are some anachronisms like certain cars not from period in some scenes, and my pet-peeve from all motor-racing films is there: namely that apparently if you want to go faster than the other car, you press the throttle that bit harder and you sort of just, go faster; so they do the same; so you do it again. Really, really annoying. Or even worse, that you somehow change a gear *up* to accelerate away.  But it's loud and brash and beautifully shot, and the crux of the storyline is true. Not quite up there with Rush for me for its handling of the material, but solid.

As a cinema-goer it was fantastic; Hugely enjoyable, fun, riveting, and the sense of speed and sound is intoxicating. The cars are just gorgeous and so well filmed. Bale is his usual phenomenal self and Damon is great too. Some subtle performances from the supporting cast were also very good.

All in all 8/10 - would watch again.",1

They honestly could've made this film so similar to Wolf of Wall Street, which actually pisses me off. I don't mean Wolf of Wall Street in the way of, drugs, money, etc. But, Belfort and Barnum highly remind me of each other, but in two different time periods who scammed in two different fields.

They could've easily started the film (which they did...) Showcasing Barnum's early struggles, slowly, and slowly later building up like they did in Wolf of Wall Street, then introducing Michelle's character, then bring more depth with only those two for awhile, then, bring in other character's like Zac Efron's which could've been the Jonah Hill piece, then Rebecca as the Margot Robbie... Playing out that that affair, showcasing how BAD he truly is...But they didn't. IF they had went with something like this (IN the sense of a MUSICAL.) It would've showcased Barnum's REAL LIFE portrayal and would've showcased beyond captivating depth and a strong plot twist (and IF they ended it with his 'empire' all collapsing like Belfort's) 

But no.... They decided to cheese out for the sake of appealing to all audiences, and made it way to fast pace with a short movie length time and decided to make the plot paper thin.

I don't normally type out comments about movies, much less on reddit, but I feel like I need to express myself. 

This movie is dull, not like, your father is watching an old western on the couch and you decided to sit down for 30 minutes and try and engage yourself in between the Viagra commercials dull, but somehow worse, because you're sitting in a theater wondering what the fuck happened with the budget. 

Every single character aside from Hercule is paper thin, i realize this is a contingency on the running time, but for fuck sake, this is Hollywood, i feel like we can cut the traveler numbers in half and develop someone worth watching, especially with this level of starpower. How the hell do you make Judi Dench into a literal crusty old bat who's largest character trait is her dog. The black character is essentially ""the black character"".

During the opening sequence in Istanbul, you're going to be greeted with what i can only describe as low-polygon CGI in between nonstop bouts of in your face exposition. The main character is the smartest and greatest person in the world at what he does, and the plot falls into his lap in the way that only an episode of house could rival. 

As far as the plot goes, you won't get your twist, you won't get that feeling that you're looking for when you walk into a mystery. There is no point in playing along, thus, there is no point to get invested into the plot, which rivals the side characters in terms of how little depth it's working with. 


The one good thing I can say about this movie from the get go and throughout is that whoever designed the costumes and some set pieces know's what they're doing. I wanted to become engrossed in the setting, but its a pretty picture at times with nothing else going on.

In many ways it is an anti twist because you expect Blanchett to be somehow linked to something in Cooper’s past. But the reveal is that it’s nothing. Her ego was hurt because he spoke about her mother and revolver. I think the simplicity of the reasoning makes the film even more powerful (at least for me).

Another round does a lot of the same. I love how it depicts alcohol. It shows our complicated relationship with it, and as someone with a complicated relationship with alcohol, I appreciate that. You can have great times with it, or it can be your worst enemy. It’s not bad or good, it just, is.

Watching this also made me miss my buds, can’t wait til we can get back to some form of normal.

The movie has a lot of funny moments intertwined with the drama, I think it’s a good balance. All the cast is great too, but mads really elevates this film. What a talent. That dance number may be one of my favourite scenes of 2020. I do think the movie drags a little at times, and I could have done with less of the mads and his wife subplot. Though I think it’s a different film without it.

It’s hard to talk about this movie without mentioning the tragedy behind it. The director’s daughter died during the filming of it in a car crash. She was even supposed to play a part in the film and the movie is dedicated to her. I can’t even imagine what that must be like, and to finish the film still?

I find your analysis of the movie somewhat effortless, maybe the film just didn't resonate with you somehow. 
I found the raw humanity of this movie in a subject that many people dont like to deal with very enthralling. Lonergan was interviewed on Fresh Air recently and he said this, “People don’t want to move on from their feelings of loss, my father passed away this year and you don’t want to leave them behind, you don’t want to get over it and feel great about it, you feel like you owe it to the people you’ve lost to carry that pain around with you in some form.” This statement was so profound for me.

551,"As someone familiar with the stage show, I loved the movie for all its artistry and heart and even the things it added. I am a bit disappointed, though, about a couple things they removed.

I understand why they switched around the reveal of Abuela winning the lottery for the adjusted storyline, but expecting the tension of that reveal and then not getting it was a jarring letdown (though it seems it worked fine for those who weren’t previously familiar). Knowing every word to the original songs didn’t help with that either.

My main issue is the removal of most of the conflict between Nina/her dad/Benny. The conflict with her dad got resolved way too quickly; I think adding back his song Inútil would have helped flesh this out. There was essentially no conflict between Nina and Benny, which I think made their characters seem rather flat (particularly Benny).

In the stage show, they’ve never really been a couple because Nina’s dad doesn’t like Benny (largely because he’s black — as others have pointed out, this other aspect of racism could have been good to touch on). They have a huge fight at the club, but then make up overnight during the blackout. They sleep together and sing a phenomenal song (Sunrise), part of which discusses breaking the news of their relationship to Nina’s dad.

Without this conflict and resolution, Nina and Benny seemed like side characters, when in the stage show, it’s honestly Usnavi and Vanessa who are less prominent (though not by much). They also, like I said, fell a bit flat for me.

Also, without Sunrise, the line in Carnaval del Barrio about them rolling in the hay doesn’t make a lot of sense. In the stage show, that’s when the cat gets out of the bag. In the movie it’s like... well yeah? They’re dating? Why should that be shocking to anyone? Not really a “no me diga” moment.",0

Lawrence is good in it, although I think it suffers a little through no fault of her own because her character is so unrelentingly stoic - she gets to play a good badass, but since she's keeping a poker face in enemy territory for most of the film we also only get little bursts of emotion and personality from her: the character loves her mom and periodically breaks down crying behind closed doors, and that's about it. Lawrence and Joel Edgerton were also a bit of a ""meh"" combo casting-wise, again nothing awful but no especial chemistry between them.

I've always l Ioved Hugh Jackman in this role, and he finally got the chance to do something beyond just growling and making faint references to the pain he's in. I felt so bad for Wolverine in this movie (and Xavier, and the kids!).

The action was so intense because it all felt real, you really felt every stab or gunshot he took with his lack of healing. And that part near the end when he went full berserker was just fantastic. 

The thing I really loved was the character moments. They actually took the time to slow the movie down and really make you feel for every character. That entire segement with the family on the farm was something i never expected from this movie. When Xavier said he didn't deserve that good day, I felt so bad for him. When Wolverine was dying and finally felt what it was like to have a family, I cried. 

I could keep going but it'll turn into an even bigger wall of text than this already is, Logan is a fantastic send off to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. It's emotional, intense, has the type of action you've always wanted out of Wolverine, and was never boring. I can't wait to see it again.

58863,"Going from what the film showed it appeared the Aborigines have a greater respect for nature, a stronger sense of community and teamwork, and they had fewer possessions and individualistic approach to life. 

Most of the white people in the film are the antithesis of this. Vic is happy to exploit everyone around him in order to secure future gains even though it's painfully obvious that future will never come. When Andy waves towards the campfire family, their first response is to hide and threaten Andy. Etta is basically sitting in the dark surrounded by useless medicine. Even Andy doesn't seem to care too much about anyone outside his immediate family until he gets to know Thoomi.

I have a lot of conservative Christian friends (who are normally all over this sort of thing) and I don't think I saw a single person even mention it on Facebook.

13898,"I saw this last week and absolutely loved it. I just read other comments observing the last line is different in the book (""I was *made* for this"" rather than the movie's ultimate line ""I was *born* for this""), and oddly enough while running this morning I listened to Marc Maron's podcast interview with del Toro where the director talks about how there are circles throughout the film in design and background elements, and how it all connects to the 360 Stanton does with the gimp.

It gets pretty heady-- the narrative focuses on grifters and cons, and how people want to believe in the supernatural and that want is used to exploit them (us), but there's simultaneously this notion of fate that underlies all the worldly cynicism. Yet another reminder why Guillermo del Toro is my favorite working director, as if I needed one! Dude isn't just passionate, he's also meticulous with fleshing out his ideas. What a master.

NA is lengthy, and I was kinda tired seeing it so I had a hard time in the middle, but that said I don't think it was too long per se, my being tired is on me. We NEED more decadent movies like this that aren't box-office friendly, the increasingly profit- and formula-driven nature of the industry is plainly strangling it to death.",1

But yeah it’s a psychological thriller about a woman going insane so you can’t have it be a bottle of gags but it definitely was good.

I had a giant ass grin on my face when Kyne brought out the hooks. I wish I had a recording of my face going from ecstatic to horrified when she died; what a great tease. 

I was really disappointed the dinner scene didn't make it in but also understand how hard a scene like that would be to convert to film.

I liked this film, but did anyone else feel the messages throughout were detracted by the absurdist poke at folks ideologies? In my theater, I think the film lost a lot of sway in messaging Cheney's abuse of power when folks felt like their political beliefs were being insulted, rightly or wrongly. I guess I just don't think you can get a point about power across by making an audience feel stupid at the same time. ",1
25073,"I had mixed feelings about the film. On a first viewing I didn't really like it much at all, I thought it started strong but lost me from the long car conversation onwards. I thought the pacing was pretty bad, like I said the aforementioned car conversation for 20+ minutes slap bang in the middle of the film just seemed so indulgent and unnecessary. I thought the ideas could have been communicated better than through a long rambling conversation. It seemed so self-indulgent and really tested my patience.  And the end confused me - more on that in a second.

It reminded me of a few things - Eraserhead, with the awkward meeting with the parents at the start. Except in this it seemed to be more about anxiety surrounding relationships than becoming a father.

Also reminded me of the Todd Solondz film Dark Horse, with the theme of a loner character who has wasted opportunities he's had - and fantasises a lot about what's happening in his head.

And the last thing it reminded me of was the game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. It takes place during a snowstorm, you end up at a high school and there's a twist about the games plot being a collection of fragmented memories. There's also a change in character perspective at the end that makes you rethink things.

I read a review saying the whole film is from the perspective of Jake, not the girlfriend, which is never made very clear. I like surreal films and odd narratives but that just seemed willfully obtuse in a way that was off-putting, which can be said for a lot of the film.

Having said all that though, I do want to watch this again. I think it's a really interesting film and I'll probably watch it with a totally different perspective the second time around. I keep thinking about it.

On the other hand, I dunno. It seems to be a super depressing film about a guy looking back on his life and imagining what could have been. It just seemed like an excercise in bleak nihilism, I don't know what else I'm meant to get out of it.",0
