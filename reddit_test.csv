173," Well, I thought it was one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile. Granted the first half was better than the rest. Absolute stupidity at every turn and I loved most of TJ Miller's lines. It's just what it said on the trailer. ""Rape *and* incest? That is dark!"" Karan Soni seems to be in a lot of stuff this year. This, Ghostbusters, and Deadpool. He also showed up in Goosebumps...where the hell did this guy come from? it was really funny. Michael made everyone switch presents when he got a crummy handmade oven mitt When a movie makes you cringe hard enough that you have your head in your hands, it's not a good sign.

It's dumb fun that delivers one of those promises: being incredibly dumb. The entire film felt like a giant commercial with memes and David Bowie jokes thrown into the mix. It rehashes pretty much every joke in the ""R-rated party movie"" book, it reeks of corporate advertising (do NOT get me started on the Cinnabon or Kia Minivan ""jokes""), and with most of the jokes being about Tinder, 3D printing your own cock and balls, Snapchat, being PC, Grumpy Cat, Fast and the Furious references and the early seasons of Degrassi: The Next Generation, it's destined to age horribly.

Almost forgot: When Aniston's character is leaving the VIP lounge, she's got a copy of The Girl on the Train. Seems to me like Amblin Partners needed some cross-promotion to boost revenue... Hey comedy directors, physical comedy is not funny if it's obviously bad CGI.  ""Canadian Television Theory with a concentration on Drake"" was my biggest laugh. Other than that, it was decently funny. T.J Miller and Jason Bateman are just likeable af  Pretty safe R rated comedy but I don't regret it. My biggest problem though is all the current pop culture references it kept making that will age it like cheese in 10 years. I liked it. Fight me /r/movies  T.J. Miller was the heart and soul of the film, everything else was the quintessential definition of meh. I know people are gonna be like, ""It's dumb, but just like turn your brain off"". But wouldn't it be better if it wasn't so unbelievably dumb? Like no one says ""the food is bad, but you can eat it if you hold your nose shut"". Like the movie is so actively dumb it takes me out of it, and not in a way were the dumbness is the joke ala Jackass, it's just noise to fill a few empty hours of the day. I love Jason Bateman. I love Rob Corddry. I did not love this. ""here's a wild Christmas party. throw in a bunch of comedy actors and let them say lines. make a few sex and drug references, that should be enough""  
the scene that defines this movie for me is when jason bateman and olivia munn get trapped on the roof. nothing happens, they go up there to smoke a joint, are locked and then.... nothing. there is no escalation of their attempts to get untrapped, there is nothing happening that they are desperately missing while stuck, the situation does not get worse and worse, they are just like, ""darn, we are stuck here now"". no comedic tension is built. they sit there, have a serious talk a bit, but nothing to get truly invested in either a comedic or in a non comedic sense, and then are almost immediately let back into the building by a guy opening the door to pee.  
still a few highlights, i especially liked tj miller, jennifer aniston and kate mckinnon's characters. too bad they don't have much to do except what you already expect them to do.  I got exactly what I expected: a few good laughs and no actual plot. I don't need to rewatch the film, or own it, but I didn't feel like it was money wasted.

But then again I don't get angry about product placements, or references like it seems this sub does at times. ""Holy shit they said Cinnabon, guess this movie bows down to their corporate sticky bun masters!"" The ending felt a bit deus ex machina. ""This revolutionary gadget comes in at the last second to save the day!"" You could also see the climax scene coming from a mile away, but I liked the movie! Even though it does have a 5.7/10 on imdb and it is a bit cheesy it was a pretty funny flick.  With a title like ""Office Christmas Party,"" I wouldn't expect much. Kate McKinnon's had a terrible movie career so far. She's like the new Dana Carvey. ""Why is that car on fire? Did the Bears win?""

That was the only genuine laugh this film got out of me. Such a talented cast wasted on a piss poor script. I guess wait for this one on Netflix?  This is one of those strange movies. Designed by committee to cash in on Christmas time and product placement. It's not even really designed to be watched by anybody. It's just mindless noise.

This is a movie sixteen year olds go to in order to get away from their parents and fingerbang in the back. Or to have on in the background of a party. Or put on by some frat boy when he's trying to get up in them guts.

What a piece of shit. Too many funny people I like for this film to be so average.  Fuck it I enjoyed it. It's no masterpiece but the cast were great fun. You will never think about this movie ever again once the credits roll because nothing actually feels like it has an impact. :(  As much as I love going to the movies to watch some low-brow comedy to pass the time, this is just a noisy bore. I damn near forgot I had even seen it until I saw this Official Discussion post. If you truly have nothing better to do, I suggest getting through that Netflix queue you've built up for yourself that you've been meaning to watch instead of this. ",0,Office Christmas Party
140," This is one of those instances where I don't really need a plot for the movie to work for me. I just want Hugh Jackman showboating, and I'm getting my money's worth. Hugh riding that elephant to his daughter's recital was so extra.  This film was quite enjoyable to me. 


Score and musical numbers all wonderful and expertly shot (the director did previously work in music videos so I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise.)


Jackman is wonderful, Zendaya is wonderful, Efron is wonderful, Rebecca Ferguson is passable (although don't miss that her singing is not her - it's Voice finalist Loren Allred). Michelle Williams is sweet enough, though she seemed uncomfortable and out of place at times.


The biggest issue for me (and it didn't ruin the movie) is that the subject matter is not correct. Barnum was no wide-eyed dreamer who longed to shelter and nurture the misunderstood. He was a conman who would do anything to make a buck, at the expense of people with genetic deformities and animals. The issue for the viewer is choosing whether or not to reconcile movie Barnum with real-life Barnum.

Altogether, the wisest decision this movie should've made would've been to make this movie about someone else- a fictional showman. That way the ties to Barnum for the viewer could be cut. And let's be real, here - the movie would've been just as memorable without all those ridiculously CGI animals (whose only purpose was to heighten an already-mind-numbing spectacle and, ironically, remind the viewers that Barnum was a monster to animals.)

A solid B- of a film - worth a popcorn watch and I'd probably buy it on DVD. I loved this movie! I thought the music and choreography was awesome. I don’t really understand the hate it’s getting. I know some people are upset it isn’t historically accurate, but we went in for a show and we got one.  I have been listening to the soundtrack on repeat since I got it. I really like it FAR more than i had thought I would. 

The singing was fantastic. The choreography was amazing. I want to see it again just to watch that. 

The pacing was great. It didn't feel like it dragged anywhere. The subtly of the ""Never Enough"" scene was breathtaking. The singing, the framing, the back and forth between the actors (facial expressions) was so moving and telling. 

I'd see it again. 

My favorite part (and there were a few) was the ""The Other Side"" with Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron. One of my favorite dancing parts. It's a fun, feel-good movie if you don't think about it too much and don't expect it to be historically accurate. We all need that sort of movie every once in awhile! I enjoyed it and don't regret seeing it.  It works as a fun family movie for the Holidays. Yes I would love to see an actual period drama based around how bad of a dude he actually was too, but let’s not bash this film because it never was going to be that in the first place.  Enjoyed this a lot more than I expected to going into it. The costuming and set design were incredible, and Jackman gave a great performance. Even so, I found Zac Efron and Zendaya's scenes to be the most compelling.

I'm definitely going to look into P.T. Barnum more now, because I know that the story they told wasn't incredibly accurate. Sounds like I'm in the minority, but I really enjoyed this movie. Hugh Jackman is great as always, and the songs were very enjoyable. The story wasn't completely predictable and even though it was his first feature, the director showed he has a great visual style, the movie looked fantastic! I'll always be one to support original musicals, I won't let that genre die! I'm...learning a lot of new things about P.T. Barnum in these comments.  That was the cheesiest movie I’ve seen all year and I loved it. The extravagant musical numbers were fun, and I appreciated the creative camerawork and choreography. Yes, the script was terrible, but the acting was on point and everyone was unwavering in their commitment. That’s impressive in itself. This feels like a Broadway production that doesn’t translate well to screen, except it was made into a movie first. I think they knew what they were making. If the music is up your alley and you don’t mind that it COMPLETELY shits on history, you’ll have fun. I'm probably the perfect audience for this film because I love Hugh Jackman, love musicals, and don't give a shit about PT Barnum or know anything about him.

I loved the movie. Thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout. I liked the songs, thought the choreography was great, and enjoyed the fluff themes of family/acceptance/whatever.

It's a musical and a far from perfect one. It's not a biopic. I don't know why people are treating it like some kind of propaganda film to drum up support for Barnum or his now-defunct circus. You people need to lighten up and let Hugh dance. I really enjoyed it for what it was, an uplifting musical with catchy songs.

I know it's not historically accurate, but I just pretended it was about Hugh Jackman himself in a past life. Who cares if it wasn't historically accurate?! It was a fun time!! He obviously was trying to make money off of these outcasts when he's stretching the truth with them. But you gotta take it for what it is, a fun musical. At least I have a new soundtrack to sing to in the shower! That opening number from Hugh was on point. ""Ladies and gents this is the moment you waited for"" how can you not have a good time with that?
Also was a nice break from all the star wars brouhaha.  Went it worried I wouldn't like it because the music felt too ""modern"". Turned out there wasn't a single song I didn't enjoy. Picked up the soundtrack on the way home. Might go back and see it again with friends, time permitting. 

Solidly enjoyable film. 

And I don't even care if its not ""historically accurate"". Its a musical...not a biopic. 

Also the Bartender in the ""Other Side"" number was amazing. bad time for a pro-circus movie Surprised they went with This Is Me as the submission for the Oscar, there are five songs I would have gone with before that one. I loved the scene where PT Barnum bought an elderly slave, toured her around the northeast claiming she was 160 and helped deliver George Washington as a baby, filled her up with liquor, and when she died, sold her to a surgeon so he could perform her live autopsy on Broadway. How much of the hate for this is because it is not the most historically accurate vs it being a bad movie? I mean, its a musical, they aren't exactly known for being historically accurate. Wow, I'm happy so many people enjoyed it!

I can't count myself among you but good for you all. I thought it was just a far more expensive Disney Channel Original Movie with all the lame and predictable ups and ""downs"". I didn't feel any risk or anticipation because it's hellbent on being feel-good instead of being interesting. If you're going to lie, make it interesting. 

I did enjoy the visual choices and the songs Never Enough and Other Side. Saw it last night....Its the most fair movie I have ever seen. Stuff just happens without consequence. Someone almost dies? They are fine the next scene. I lost all my money? Now I have money! My wife hates me? Not any more! It felt less like a story and more like Shakespeare in love for a topic you are not familiar with at all. The movie was a 65 it passes. There was moving pictures on screen and  you can tell a lot went into this movie but that is about it. The music is very forgettable. The acting is good but not amazing. The story is good but just lightly explores the world without going too deep into anything. Everyones accents are all over the place and that is really it.        This was a fun movie.  Critics seemed like they wanted a historically-accurate representation of Barnum's past, which it is not.  But if you want a fun movie that follows history loosely filled with incredible, spine-tingling singers, then this is for you. I loved this movie. The choreography and songs were amazing. The bar scene with Zac and Jackman was fantastic, with the bartender included.

My only complaint is that the movie went from Jackman being poor to being super rich in the span of 5 minutes. My boyfriend said I was literally smiling the entire time. That movie was magical as fuck! Who gives a damn if PT was really a shitty person. It was a great movie Idc what anyone says  It's just so big and bright and.. And... Happy. I just smiled the whole movie, I even teared up in parts. 

I know it's not true to life and didn't even have time to bag on the movie for having modern music in a movie set in the 1800's because the opening number was just so impressive. 

It kinda clicked for me that this was a representation of how the circus felt for people of the time: the wonder, the spectacle and the largeness of it. I didn't even care that it wasn't true to history, I just had a hell of a good time.

I wish they'd tour this live. The music is so good, and it's totally not my normal listening style. While I was walking my dog I was listening to the soundtrack and choking up, it's just that powerful. 

Such talent on screen and off, I can't believe people are hating on it, but different strokes for different folks. 

Maybe at a different point in my life, I'd have felt differently about it, but at this juncture if I'm going to the movies, I want to be entertained. I usually wait for serious movies to come to streaming before I watch them, *if* I watch them anymore. 

Not that this was a silly movie, it just didn't have an agenda or a major societal message. Just the ""follow your dreams/heart/etc"" one we grew up with via Disney movies. ",0,The Greatest Showman
41," FINALLY!!!!!i have been waiting for a discussion for this film on this sub for soooooo long. i’ll echo my comment on r/truefilm on the bonfire scene, which has been steadily becoming one of my favorite scenes in movies of all time. the use of acapella to build tension. the way the scene climax when they *finally* make eye contact. héloïse’s dress catches on fire; they realize theyre in love. héloïse looks down and sees her burning dress and does nothing but accept it; accept their love despite all the implications that comes with it. she ignores how incredibly inappropriate their love was at that time and how she already knew it could only end in pain. i love it so much and how it reuses old clichés of fire = passion/love and make something that feels completely new in how well made it was. 

theres this haunting image of héloïse in her wedding dress that appears more than once after they kiss, and not only is this as a callback to the tale of orpheus (héloïse disappears every time marianne turns around to look at her until she finally does disappear for real and their love is lost forever) but it is also a heartbreaking reminder to the both of them that they’ll never be happy even when theyre together due to the looming dread of her eventual but certain marriage. its the acknowledgement of their unhappy ending by the character herself that breaks me. 

im so fucking happy that this movie exists and really do feel like its a once-in-a-generation kind of film for me. The last scene is going to stick with me for a long time. 

The most effective part is it's not just pure sobbing. She smiles for a moment, even as the tears pour, she's feeling every emotion as she listens and remembers. It just breaks my fucking heart, even weeks after having seen it. Man - the acapella at the bonfire spooked me when it first started. I purposely didn’t read anything before seeing the movie and I was worried that it was going to take a hard left into Midsommar/The VVitch territory. 

Phew! The complete lack of any score made every single musical moment hit hard. Damn. Loved this! When Marianne saw the painting with Héloïse's finger on that page.... I lost my shit bro. That scene with the armpit and the drugs... The cool thing about this movie is that it's a fucking masterpiece This movie be out here making me cry about a fucking page number. Like damn. Finally able to share my thoughts with a wider audience now that the discussion is live. I caught this early January.

As a straight male, this movie resonated with me in ways unimaginable.

I don't think its recency bias in the slightest, but as soon as the credits started to roll, wiping the flood of uncontrollable tears, I thought to myself: *""Yup. This is one of the most beautifully moving films I have ever experienced and an immediate Top 5 favorite of mine.""*

So much is said without anything every being said; the film is its loudest, most loving, and most intelligent in its quietest moments. The scenes between Marianne and Heloise during their sessions, especially the one where Heloise questions ""And who do I look at?"" were magnetic despite being such tender, whisper-soft moments.

There are several scenes that are still imprinted in my mind that I cannot shake, but, above all, those final 10 minutes, but more so those final 4 minutes, during the orchestra, as the music swells and we see a range of emotion play out on her face...it's unreal.

This film was beautiful, and everyone should really do their best to experience it. >""Why doesn't she smile.""

> ""Perhaps because you aren't funny.

>*next time Marianne and Heloise are together*

>""So do you think your sister wanted to die."" 

Damn I need to step up my flirt game. The scene where Marianne and Heloise kind of taunt each other by informing the other of their tells is a great new example of an incredibly hot scene with no sex in it. I went into the film expecting it to primarily be about the relationship between Marianne and Héloïse, and it mostly was. But I was also pleasantly surprised how big of a part of the movie Sophie was. The abortion scene with her lying on the bed next to the little kid was utterly gripping, and I loved how much of the film was centered on the interactions between all three of them. When we were zoomed in on Heloise at the end I half expected Visions of Gideon to start playing. Like yeah queer movie where they don’t end up together but same guy punch that hurts so good Not to brag but.... Héloïse and me were doing the exact same thing as the music played at the end... I read somewhere that the director said she wanted to show consent with their first kiss. But openly asking for it wasn’t that romantic and break the flow of the scene for people. So she made them cover their mouths. Lifting the covers meant they were giving their consent. I’ll try to find the article.

Edit: I couldn't find the one I read but found these:

>“[R](https://www.advocate.com/film/2019/12/19/portrait-lady-fires-female-gaze-fight-against-convention)[egarding](https://www.advocate.com/film/2019/12/19/portrait-lady-fires-female-gaze-fight-against-convention) eroticism, it was all the eroticism of consent. The first kiss scene is shot like that. They both unveil their mouths. They're both saying yes to this, and this is new and sexy,” Sciamma says. “This is not like the usual scene. Each time somebody touched somebody, they asked.” 

&#x200B;

>[And](https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/19/21137213/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-celine-sciamma-interview) also, the movie is fully about consent and how consent is also super erotic and super sexy. Sophie, even though she went through this, she’s being asked what she wants. And each time they touch each other, they never touch each other without asking first. We tried to make it very mutual. I was wondering why the didn't choose to be lovers above all else and just abandon everything. The move answered this. She asked her to turn around at the end, they chose the ending of poets not lovers. I had a strong initial reaction that Celine Sciamma made a mistake with the ending. I really believed she should have cut the movie off after Marianne turns around. So many movies seem to meander and linger long after the emotional weight of the climax has completely dissipated. The Coen Brothers often feel like the only directors that understand abrupt endings are incredibly powerful if done right.

 Seeing the movie again I now realize that reaction was wrong and bad and Sciamma is smarter and a much better writer than I am. “Turn around.” That scene where Marianne finally sees Heloise in the wedding dress in real life is going to haunt me for a long time. I absolutely love how every single frame of this film looks like it could be a painting. Sciamma has an amazing eye for that. This falls into my exact favourite romantic genre where >!the last 10 minutes are a devastating timeskip that makes me want to die.!< The slow-burn investment into their relationship is so worth it. There were several times where I think I just straight up stopped breathing. This is one of those amazing films where I thought it was okay but then the more I thought about it the more scenes just kept replaying in my mind and now I love it. The image of the faceless portrait, burning from the heart. The musical chant and the fiery dress. The haunting image of Heloise in her wedding dress. The tender kiss.

Of course the best thing is the way the film pays off so brilliantly in the final two scenes. I can't believe a page number in a portrait could make me cry but the film has earned that brilliant catharsis. And of course the final shot, insanely acted by  Adèle Haenel but also a beautiful portrait of the way art that has informed our lives changes the way we interact with it.

Goddamn what an incredible movie. They just gave the Cesar to Polanski instead of Sciamma. End me. France really fucked themselves over by not submitting this for Best International Feature. It's far superior to Les Miserables and I think would have been a worthy rival to Parasite.

Gorgeous film through and through. Beautifully somber, subtle screenplay about forbidden love. The performances are breathtakingly good - that Adele Haenel is straight up angelic in this. The cinematography, production design, costume design were all top notch. One of the best directed movies of 2019, everyone should see it at least once! Seeing the ending of this film in theaters is an experience I will never forget. I became so locked into that last shot, that at some point I had gotten tunnel vision and I realized I wasn’t breathing. And when it finally cut to black there was this amazing moment where I noticed that no one else, in a packed theater, was breathing either. Complete and devastating silence resonated in my ears and when the credits finally appeared, I broke down. I’m a straight male, and I never felt anything like that before. This is one of those films that transcends its own sexuality into a universal message of memory, regret, passion, loneliness, seclusion, etc. I could go on, but I’ve thought about this film every day since I saw it three weeks ago. A masterpiece. Fucking loved this.  

My soul left my body when they showed the little 28 in the new portrait.  We're watching Marianne come to terms with her regret and her heart breaking all over again when they decide to flip it on us.  It honestly made me feel shit. ",0,Portrait of a Lady on Fire
159," This summers been all about disappointing blockbusters, remakes, and reboots. Nice to see a movie that is well written, has actual character development, and is patient and nuanced. Probably the best thing that Chris Pine has ever done, and I quite like him in the first Star Trek,

 It's my favorite of the year so far. I'm probably going to go again soon. Couldn't recommend it more My two favourite scenes/moments:
- Chris Pine visibly nervous, trying to keep his composure as the cop checks his license at the road block.
- When Chris essentially challenges Jeff Bridges to a duel on the porch, Jeff subtly inches his fingers toward his gun before the truck with the ex-wife and kids pulls into the driveway.
Just excellent, small details in their acting that drew me into the story better than any movie I've seen in theater this year. Most of what I liked about this film has already been posted. One thing I haven't seen mentioned: NO LOVE INTEREST. I was dreading it first when the waitress was all flirty, then when the girl approached him in the casino, then with his ex wife, but nope. It made the relationship with his brother all the more powerful, and it was enough that he was going through all this to break the cycle of poverty with his kids. Did anyone else get the idea that the blonde brother was a veteran? It started with the first scene with the graffiti about veterans troubles, made me think that the director wanted us to think about that. When I saw how he taped his clips together I thought ""that seems like an army trick"". And when he took out his sniper rifle and started making great shots, it kind of clicked for me.  My favorite part of this movie is how utterly absorbed -everyone- in the theater was.  When Alberto was sniped near the end, almost everyone there let out a collective gasp.

That, and Jeff Bridges as a cowboy. I think this film was a perfect example of translating the Western into the modern world. People are trying to hold on to the way things used to be, but you can't outrun the trains of ""progress.""

I guess Chris Pine's character ""won"" in the end, but at a terrible cost...and regardless of what he did, he can't stop the change. His kids aren't going to work the ranch, and the banks will keep taking advantage of the locals. 

I'm not really sure there's a ""Bolivia"" left in the world to hide, even for a time. 

Great, great film. Great story, great writing, great performances. Head and shoulders above anything else I've seen this year.  Does a movie like this with such strong brother relationships resonate strongly with any one else?  We don't see any flashback, just an old photo of the two of them, but the dialogue is so descriptive that we can make out what their lives had been before.  


The second casino bar scene really got to me as a person with a sibling, as in the first we see Tobye just patiently waiting to cash out, anxious for the next job, before he interacts with another women.  However he is ""saved"" by his brother and you see how the two of them are different but there for one another.  And then when Toby hears the news of the shootout on the Tv and it just fades out and we see him curl up around the chips and put his brother's hat on and just cries.  Man that was such an emotional scene fore me and I think every actor and actress in the movie really gave amazing performances.  I think that the actors show the characters pain and different issues so realistically, and the writing is still so dramatic and captivating.

Ben Foster as Tanner was so calculated.  His brother reminds him to ""slow down"" but the reply is ""I'm not speeding"" just foreshadows how ruthless and and prepared the older brother is.  He killed their abusive father,putting an end to the dangerous situation.   He doesn't hesitate to kill two armed civilians to protect Toby.  He is constantly lugging around ""his livelihood"" much to Toby's protest but when it looks as if they are going to be run down by the militia, Tanner effectively and efficiently disarms the situation he saw coming.  I don't remember exactly what his last lines went, [I am the master of the plains, this is who I am].  Which mirrored the Native American encounter earlier in the bar, is then brought full circle.  When Jeff Bridges character, winded and tired, claims the kill to avenge his fallen partner.  

Man I loved this movie, I felt so lucky to watch it the in morning, very empty theater, the only downside was that the screen was flickering the whole time, distracting from the brightness and what was happening on screen.  I'm curious as to what other people thought about the cinematography and if I should see it again in a better theater.

  The showdown between Pine and Bridges at the end is my favorite ending to any movie i've seen this year. Edge of my seat throughout the whole thing.  I can't give this film enough praise, my favorite scene was the exchange between Tanner and the Comanche in the casino.

""Comanche means enemy of everyone.""

""You know what that makes me then?""

""An enemy.""

""A comanche.""

And then it's called back on the ridge, ""Lord of the plains.""

Taylor Sheridan is really knocking it out of the park, I hope his next film continues the trend Absolutely **love** how this movie used violence through its later half. As you're watching the initial robberies, due to the lack of (extreme) physical harm, you start to think, ""ohhh they're harmless, nothing *too* bad is really going to happen..."", but during the final robbery when they shoot and kill? Completely shocked! Caught me with a bat right across the head and reminded me that these are dangerous situations and that no, you can't just rob a bank with zero consequence. True Fact Mr. Pibb is for Assholes I went in to this movie expecting to laugh exactly 0 times. I left the movie having laughed more than I did watching Suicide Squad.  I love how the movie puts so much effort into developing the characters that you eventually do care about their fates. Like when Jeff Bridges' partner was shot in the head, I was shocked and a little upset. What don't you want?   Hands down, best movie of the summer. The scene with the waitress had me cracking up for awhile This is definitely in my top 5 of the year so far.

Fantastic acting from Pine, Foster, and Bridges , superb writing and direction and  great music.

It was funny when it needed to be, tension filled the screen when it should have and the ending was pitch perfect in keeping with the tone of the time. I recommend everyone who has a chance to go see this does. This film was absolutely fantastic. Most of the positive comments cover what I loved about it. 

But I'll add that this movie shows that the western is not dead but is still very alive. The genre offers so much and I hope to see more in the near future.  In a movie filled with memorable moments, the most amazing to me was Jeff Bridges' ten-second bit of acting after his character shoots Tanner (Ben Foster). Going from temporary joy at getting revenge on the man who killed his partner, to horrified sadness at the thought that he did, indeed, just kill someone. A perfect summary of the complicated morals of the film, all conveyed through Bridges' performance.

Brilliant film. Great movie.  Great performances by everyone.  I love a Nick Cave and Warren Ellis composed score.  Always pleasing.

And again, I don't know how the hell Hollywood has done Ben Foster so wrong.  The dude deserves more roles.  He acts circles around his peers.

Only complaint: They didn't need to beat you over the head with the bank message.  I would have got the message well enough with the plot, and maybe one or two trips down a highway littered with 'For Sale' and 'Debt Management' signs.  And, again, you know, the plot.  They were a little heavy-handed with driving that point home.

But still, enjoyed the movie very much.  Girlfriend is listening to the soundtrack as she cooks supper this very moment. That last bank sequence was amazing. So fucking tense. I loved the way Ben Foster ordered the bank tellers to take out the money in unison like a drill sergeant. And then when they're trying to escape, more civilians are shooting at them outside. 

Moral of the story: Don't rob banks in Texas While neither the themes (the financial crisis) or the films that really clearly inspired *Hell or High Water* (*No Country For Old Men, Dog Day Afternoon*) are subtle, they don't have to be.

When you lead with graffiti that bemoans the economic downturn from the perspective of someone who did three tours in Iraq, an older woman in a threadbare dress smoking her last cigarette before opening a small town bank, and a 1988-1992 era Camaro ZR2 in present day--you know this is a poor area. And you feel it. The desolation permeates every single frame.

Nearly every scene is filled with the poor, people living from paycheck to paycheck, people who have settled into their lives and don't want to change. Even the bank management, who are by and large the villains of this film, are clearly in a situation where they know they can't get ahead and will take any measure to defend what scraps they can get.

So when you get levity in Jeff Bridges' near-retirement Texas Ranger and his partner played by Journeyman B-Movie Needs A Native American actor Gil Birmingham, or the few spots of brotherly infighting and fun between the bank robbing duo of Chris Pine and Ben Foster... It's well appreciated.

Then again, both of these pairs find their own strains, their own failures, and their own parallels as the plot moves forward.

And all of these things tell one story.

Everyone in this movie had something taken from them. Everyone loses a major piece of themselves. And that's just what happens, sometimes.

Here's to the first Obvious Frontrunner for the Oscars. Jesus, Jeff Bridge is AMAZING in it. I loved his Texas Ranger performance.

Ben is also solid, but I think I liked Pine the better. Never saw him doing a role like that.

What a great plot, really interesting. Really happy I saw it.

 Fun film glad i watched it. Chris pine was so good looking it ruined the experience  no homo The [gas station scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4s5Ld0Dpdc) was amazing. My favorite scene in the film.

I saw this pretty awesome observation in the YouTube comments: 

At 1:17 you can see Tanner's arm move as he reaches for his gun after the punk tries to intimidate him

At 1:56 you can see Tanner had his gun ready to shoot﻿ ""I love you, Toby.""

""I love you too.""

177," Hank is the epitome of Reddit I think my favorite part was Dory's dads receding hairline.  Gerald and Hank stole the flipping show! Just found out I missed the post credits scene. I'm mad as hell. They took Dory's quirk and turned it into a heartbreaking rendition of mental illness and its effect on the entire family unit.  Every line that tiny Dory said killed me a little more.  Her poor parents! You know what's hilarious?

Had Dory swam down when Marlin was yelling at her early on in the film after the squid scene, she would have found her family. The sea lions absolutely stole the movie for me!  This is the movie that The Good Dinosaur should have been. Same general plot, but this was far better executed. Ed O'Neill was fantastic and Ellen showed more range than I expected her to have considering she hasn't acted in years. 

The short was fantastic.  The whole Sigourney Weaver thing cracked me up.

I thought it did a good job not having the same plot as the first movie.

It was sufficiently funny.

The new characters were enjoyable. Very nice movie. For a second, I thought Dory's parents counting down would lead to them leaving her behind. Thankfully, Pixar gets dark, but not THAT dark. Did anyone else think that the sea otter cooperation at the end was out of the blue? Perhaps a scene was cut out showing them interacting explaining why they'd listen to em?  Also, I feel like I've been watching that Secret Life of Pets trailer for like three years. Sigourney Weaver's performance as Sigourney Weaver was phenomenal.  The new characters were wonderful! Also, I was in stitches at the van falling off the cliff with Louis Armstrong playing in the background.

Edit: Btw, the animation for Hank was AMAZING. My  whole theater let out a collective AAWWW when baby Dory showed up on screen. The most unrealistic part was believing that anyone actually wants to go to Cleveland. Who played that clam in the Tide Pool. I was dying that part was hilarious!  When baby Dory sadly sings ""just keep swimming""........goddammit Pixar ! The recurring Sigourney Weaver jokes were brilliant.  When they panned up to show all the shell pathways; the tears started to flow. Great job, Pixar! I love the fact that octopuses are always trying to escape captivity and Pixar twisted it so that Hank was only trying to escape so he could be kept in captivity.  Can we talk about how great that short at the beginning was? I enjoyed Idris Elba as the seal the most I think the movie did a fantastic job of calling back to the original, but not over doing it. The perfect amount of old jokes. 
They took Dory and instead of constantly beating you with ""remember how funny it is when she forgets things!"" for an hour and a half they made it have a purpose. They did a really good job at turning dory from comedic relief character to the main character without sacrificing the quality of the movie. 


The fun fact octopus three heart jokes was hysterical.  Young Dory is the cutest thing I have ever seen in my life.

That is all. ",0,Finding Dory
109," But really though, do u wanna build a snowman... papa can u hear me... is Ryan Reynolds the first to point this out??  My favorite callback was the bags of coke next to the cure for blindness  Never thought Dolly Parton could be the perfect soundtrack to violence. Using the song from the Logan OST at the end when wade was dying was a nice touch.

He was really dead set on getting that wolverine moment lol. I can’t even explain my favorite part; I just loved it so much. Cable was badass, the references were a hundred fold, the X-Force almost immediately dying horrible deaths was hilarious, Juggernaut was awesome, the X-Men cameo was hilariously unexpected, just.. everything was fantastic in my eyes.

Edit: that end credits scene too. That had me rollin’.

Edit edit: How could I forget the joke about Rob Liefeld not being able to draw feet? I swear I was the only one who laughed at that one in a packed theater. Its been a great year for Josh Brolin. Cable was fucking incredible. Juggernaut vs Colossus was fantastic, ""I'll melt you down and make you my cock ring"". I was not expecting the actual X-Men in this. That was fucking hilarious. The James bond intro was fantastic. Can’t get over when he signs the kid’s cereal box Ryan Reynolds  Holy shit that Post Credit Scene  The X-Force was a better Suicide Squad than Suicide Squad. It's the motherfucking JUGGERNAUT, bitch!

But seriously, awesome surprise villain cameo, with a nice dose of foreshadowing I think the biggest laugh in my theater was the Baby Instinct leg cross. ~\*~\* Bye, Yukio! \*~\*~ The version of ""Take On Me"" used in the movie was really fantastic... Honestly quite an emotional scene bolstered by the beautiful music The X-Force dying after the high winds parachuting was honestly the most hilarious part of this movie. Juggernaut totally woke up at the end right? Jokes aside, I appreciated how many surprises were left in the movie and how little we got out of the trailer. The trailer focused on the X-Force team which made their sudden deaths hilarious. We had no idea Juggernaut was in this. There were even scenes in the trailer with Morena that weren't in the movie so even though she dies right off the bat I was still guessing if she'd come back some how. 

I love to be surprised at the movies and this was full of fun surprises. When Wade hugs the guy that just killed his girl, simply because he needed a hug. That shit was heavy af

Then he rolls him into an oncoming truck

   Brad Pitt being vanish was the most unexpected thing ever haha loved the movie.. it managed to recycle some things from the first yes but still keep so much charm and hilarious jokes at every scene, so some of the repeated jokes didn’t even matter. It’s just a badass hilarious and one of a kind super..vigilante movie  The parachuting scene killed me Kudos to the marketing. There was a lot of misdirection in the trailers. Like, in a surprisingly good way. Deadpool going back in time to kill X-Men Origins Deadpool and Ryan Reynolds is seriously one of the loudest laughs I’ve had in a theater!  Was the scene with Juggernaut being thrown into the water a big pun?? Cause they shoved a Cable up his butt and threw him into a Pool?? ",0,Deadpool 2
143," It's a shame the actress who voiced the animated Belle, Paige O'Hara, or the first Broadway Belle, Susan Egan, didn't get cameo appearances in the film.

The stained glass windows telling the prologue in the original was nice, but seeing it actually happen in this version was a good idea.

The objects losing their human forms at the end was just heart-wrenching. Beast can snowball with the best of 'em 

Edit:

https://youtu.be/nVHhPJVcBlI I liked the references to the upcoming French Revolution. The excess shown in the beginning. And of course the part where the candle stick says.... This is France, and then chops some food as though he was operating a guillotine  Belle: ""Romeo and Juliet is my favorite play!"" 

Beast: Omg what a basic bitch.  Belle never gets to eat her dinner during ""Be our Guest."" They keep pulling it away from her. I'm still thinking about this.  Biggest laugh of the film for me was when Maestro changed from a piano to a fucking mini gun. I thought it was pretty solid, and did the original justice. 


Making the prince older when he got cursed makes a whole lot more sense than cursing a child. 

Then saying it was magic that made the town forget the castle was nice. 

Having the enchantress basically heal and change the beast back at the end made more sense than him magically recovering from his injuries in the original. 

I'm also confused as to what the openly gay scene people freaked out about was.

Was it during Gaston's song when LeFou had him hug him from behind? The dance at the end? If Disney hadn't said something, I wouldn't have had a second thought since LeFou always came across as gay to me. 

 Oh poor Philippe had to go back and forth the forest so many times!! He barely escaped the wolves that many times too! Scariest scene in the movie= that doctor's plague mask Literally just sat up in bed because I had an epiphany.

So in the beginning when Belle is singing the opening song, she runs into that one villager and asks him ""Have you lost something?"" and he says ""Yes, but I can't remember what."" 
We later find out at the very end of the movie that this villager is the husband of Mrs. Potts and the father of Chip. In the prologue of the movie it is said that all of the guests that were in the castle at the time of the curse were driven away from it and made to forget everything.

THAT'S WHAT HE FORGOT. HE FORGOT HE HAD A WIFE AND KID AND THAT HE'D BEEN TO THE CASTLE YEARS BEFORE. 

Ugh, I hate when Disney makes me feel things. I need a moment. Sir Ian McKellen is a treasure.

""Back into a clock! Back into a clock!"" All I want in life is that library. I'm glad they changed the scene about how Belle and Papa escaped the ""prison"", breaking the lock makes way more sense than Chip on an axe choppin machine. I wanted to see it happen, but that would have been so so off No one seems to be mentioning it but I absolutely loved what they did with Maurice. In the animated version he's this silly, bumbling, almost mad-scientist character, to the point where you can almost sympathize with Gaston for wanting him committed. In this version though, he's given a lot more backstory, his motives are a lot clearer (moving to a small village to protect Belle from plague, putting her first so much that he stops to get her a gift even while running away from a haunted castle). I thought Kevin Kline brought the perfect combination of wit and Mr. Fischoeder eccentricity to the role. In a story about intelligence and exposure to the outside world, I'm glad they didn't make Maurice a punchline. Gaston was clearly not eating 5 dozen eggs.  Anyone else noticed The Hunchback of the Notre Dame theme playing when Belle and Beast visited Paris? Plot Twist! Belle and her father get the plague from the rose rattle her plague infested mother kissed. This was fun.  I was worried about Dan Stevens voice for the beast before going in, but I was pleasantly surprised!


Luke Evans did a great job, and Josh Gaad has a habit of stealing the scenes he's in.


I liked the changes made to most of the songs.
I also forgot how much I love ""The Mob Song""

For the bad . . . I wish they hadn't auto tuned Emma Watson and Dan Stevens so much. It's pretty obvious next to the rest of the cast who doesn't need it. And if you are going to auto tuned, do a better job. 


They did not improve on the original film, but they did a good job in trying. So, at the end when Chip tries to jump off to find his 100 year old mother before they all turn inanimate, the saucer breaks.  Was that actually part of Chip, or is Chip just the cup, and the saucer was actually another object?  Was the saucer a dude?  Did we just watch a butler die? Is there a post credits scene that hints at a Kingdom Hearts Cinematic Universe? I was actually pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed getting to know the back stories of the characters, as well as seeing a lot of the glaring plot holes fixed. I especially loved how they humanized LeFou (and his joke about illiteracy was one of the funniest in the movie).  But honestly, I'd love any movie that features a singing Ewan McGregor... I have figured out the Disney live action remake formula that works:

1.) Cast someone from Downton Abbey (We'll call this the Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast Rule)

2.) Cast someone from another fantasy franchise (Harry Potter in the case of BatB; Game of Thrones in the case of Cinderella)

3.) Don't mess with the plot (Mostly Maleficent, also Alice)

4.) Don't cast Johnny Depp (Alice Alice Alice Alice) Just saw it and would say it was a positive movie experience. I knew if it was anything like the original it would be, at the very least an ok movie. And while it did stay true to the original it also added some new interesting moments that gave the audience more of an understanding with some of the movie's characters. The new added material was all great IMO and the only flaws lied within the recreation of some source material. 

Here are some thoughts I wrote down shortly after seeing it.

Could have picked a better belle but Emma has star power and that's what sells. I like how her father was a little less quirky than in the original and the explanation of belles mothers death added a layer of emotion we haven't seen from our favorite Disney princess. Aside from giving belle(whose first love is reading) a ""spectacular"" library, beast also was the reason she finally understood why her father left Paris. Due to beast opening up that enchanted book, it provided the audience another reason Belle continued opening her heart to beast. Also the flower pin she got from where her mom died was a plot device used later in the movie to open the asylum carriage.. small details like this can often be the difference between good and bad movies. I like how they included the organ and he had a happy ending unlike in the Christmas movie haha. I thought Gaston did an excellent job and other then Lefeu's spelling of ""GASTON"" (which felt awkward and out of place) Gastons song was second only to Be our guest. Ewan hit all the right notes in what to me was the most visually spectacular scene in the movie. Maybe the only time in the entire movie where I didn't question whether it was real or not because frankly I didn't care, I felt like I was one of the guests. So overall beauty and the beast was an above average remake of a timeless Disney classic. It had a couple scenes that were really amazing and just a few heads scratchers. Recasting unforgettable characters is tough and Disney did a great job providing us a handful of performances that were just as good as the original. ""Everything's alive! What's your name?""

""Belle that's a hairbrush"" Ouch, they didn't have the iconic line ""Marie! The baguettes, hurry up!"" 0/10 just for leaving out that.

No, but seriously it was really good. Josh Gad as Lefou stole the movie for me. Every scene he was in had me cracking up. He was just naturally charming and funny. And I gotta say I love the Beast's song. All in all a really great adaptation of the original.  ",0,Beauty and the Beast
147," I really enjoyed it. Don't get the hate. I noticed a lot of the mannerisms that characters made when they were caught lying and I think it would be fun to watch it a second time and look for more.  I like to think that Willem Dafoe' s character showed up to the gig doing the accent and no one else knew he was gonna be doing it. One plot point I completely missed, why did Johnny Depp's character kill the child? I just got back from this. I liked it. But I didn't enjoy it the way I feel whodunnits should be enjoyed. I wasn't invested. I was never trying to figure out who did it. I was just watching and not observing. I enjoyed the performances and it was shot really well.  Did anyone else wonder if the person whose seat Poirot took (remember he got a place on the train because someone didn't show up) was supposed to be in on the murder? I kept waiting for that to be the last clue.  Two specific shots stood out to me.

The first when Poirot boarded the train, and then walked to his room. Wonderful introduction to the setting and a nice way to show you the layout of the train.

The second was the top-down view when the body is discovered. Like the other, this was made to look like a single shot if I am remembering correctly.

Both these were really great. Maybe I'm reading into the movie a little bit but it seemed to me the scene with the uneven eggs and Poirot's willingness to accept it nicely foreshadowed the ending of the film.

""I do not blame you, I blame the hen."" The main thing I got from this movie is I'd love to go on a classy train ride like that.   So Poirot never even reaches London to solve the original case, and then takes another in Egypt? One thing at a time, man. [There was a polite collective chuckle of acknowledgment in my theater when the messenger told Poirot there had been a death on the Nile.](#spoiler)  Johnny Depp’s casting is perfect. What was the exact dialogue when Poirot first catches Mulqueen?? He says something like ""whats the american word for????"" Then he shouts FUDGE!!!  Did I really just sit through a whole movie thinking Ewan McGregor was playing the lead the whole time I wasn’t a fan of Branagh’s direction for Thor, but I appreciated a lot of the camera flourishes here - the top down-perspective of Depp’s cabin, the not that subtle split-glass face shot of Dafoe, the long tracking shot as Poirot first boards the train. Good stuff. 

The real star of the movie is the sleeping protector for the mustache. I wasn’t sure if they’d switch up the ending, but the staging of the final summation was a great scene - especially the victim’s-eye view of the murder.  I enjoyed this film a lot. Made me want to go back and watch the original! The cinematography was quite good, but I do believe the star of the show was (as usual with this guy) Branagh himself. I felt like his Poirot was a ton of fun. I enjoyed his performance so much. I think part of the charm was that in a film where the rest of the characters were played so straight and serious most of the time, down to earth as it were, Poirot's larger than life personality was charming and energetic. And, importantly, it was not so overblown that it was jarring or overly unbelievable. For those who don't love slow mysteries as much as myself, I think it will be little draggy in the middle, but, as someone who has a soft spot for any kind of murder mystery, I loved it. 

 I enjoyed it but there was something off about it. I kinda felt like the Armstrong story came out of nowhere and then it was barely explained at first.  How can Poirot sleep next to a cabin where [12 persons come and go and he doesnt hear them?](#spoiler) when you consider he doesnt seem in a deep stage of sleep (he woke up prior to that) Should have left out the detective's dead lover (added nothing to the story). I feel like perhaps subtracting two characters (like Marquez) would have allowed for a better character story. A lot of people seemed confused about who Linda Harden was in the theater listening to comments after.
 
Average film that should have been more given the cast. It looked beautiful, the cast was great, but ultimately I found it underwhelming.  The score was especially lacking. 

Brannagh embraces the character of Poirot (and that mustache!) but with so many characters and less than two hours to tell the story, instead of a heavy focus on a couple people just about everyone got not quite enough screentime.

Overall I'd say if you're a fan of the genre, check it out, but there are better versions of this story out there. Overall a very enjoyable film! I came in expecting a murder mystery And thats what I got! Although I will say I wish it had more clues for the audience to find. We kept getting details as the plot progressed. I didn’t really feel like there were hints for the audience to look back at and go, “ooooh, I can’t believe I missed that!”

I also felt that the ending’s culprit, (spoiler all of them) was very weird, but when Poirot did his monologue while walking through the train about people loosing their ways and how one crime had turned into many, I came to terms with it.

Overall, I enjoyed what I saw, especially since movies like this, a classic whodunnit are very few and far now a days... How's Daisy Ridley? To the people complaining about the plot, this is typical Christie - Poirot's 'methods' are 90% guesswork which he calls 'the little gray cells', there's very little actual deduction in her books either.

e.g. one character says she teaches geography, another makes some vague reference, so of course the 2 must be the same person, never mind the incredible odds. This kind of stupidity is there in the stories as well.

The movie is good for what it was - great visuals,  set pieces and CGI. And the music in the 3rd act is incredible, that for me was almost worth it.

In the end, there will only be one David Suchet, the rest are pretenders. But I'm glad films like this still get made. It made me sad to go for a 9.30pm show and the theater was completely empty (there were only 3 people including me!) in a major metro area. Had to leave my theater 10 minutes into the second act because some snot-nosed kid pulled the fire alarm at my theater. I'll be back tomorrow after I see the rest! Personally I thought this was one of the worst movies of the year and Branagh completely butchered the story with his disregard for the genre. My biggest gripe is that it is poorly paced and doesn't do any of the detective work that is to be expected of a story like this. As many people have noted, the film wastes too much time focusing on irrelevant points and shoehorns too many things (like an ill-conceived racial commentary and a random chase scene in the snow lol). It completely forgets that you have let the audience in so that any tension is build up with the audience trying to solve it as well or else its just a bare crime thriller. Characters are poorly introduced and developed, where some of them are just mindlessly neglected and only appear whenever they are needed. For example, the film is so lazy that it causally puts a montage scene for some of the characters despite the fact the audience should feel everyone is a suspect, but the film spends too much time on Daisy Ridley and Josh Gadd. 

The film really falls apart by the final third where it feels like Branagh is just rushing it with rapid-fire interrogation scene and the mystery is never let to simmer. Perhaps one of the most egregious part is where [Michelle Piffer's character gets stabbed (a change in the book) but the film never addresses this again and immediately cuts to the next scene despite being of vital importance. Similarly, where the doctor later shoots Poirot, the next scene is immediately the denouement without any consequences for the doctor](#spoiler). This has to be by far the worst denouement put on screen where there little flow and reasoning to how Poirot in this film got to his conclusions. Instead, it puts this bizzare moral thesis that is hard to believe given that the 'smartest detective in the world' surely isn't dumb enough to see the world as black and white... 

I immediately went to see the 1974 Lumet's version and fell in love with that. That is how it should be properly done with the mystery being the forefront and every character given the appropriate screen time. The 1974 manages to put the Armstrong side story at the forefront making it make a lot more sense in the context of the film which the 2017 version completely butchers. I love this genre of films and seriously hope more would be made (including a revised Sherlock Holmes), but this adaptation doesn't give me much hope unfortunately.  Johnny Depp was as Johnny Deppy as he always is, Kenneth Branagh's Mustache was fantastic as well and Daisy Ridley was good too... Overall a very enjoyable film.  ",0,Murder on the Orient Express
25," Okay but heart fucking broke when I saw Bruno’s table setting. That has to be the most quietly heartbreaking things I’ve ever seen in a Disney movie. ""We Don't Talk About Bruno."" Proceeds to have the best musical number in the film about Bruno. So the cousin can't keep a secret for 5min at dinner but has been hearing Bruno in the walls for how many years and never bothered to mention it..? mirabel’s gift being bringing her family to reality was such a great peaceful resolution, but i really wish we saw what kind of room casita built for her! after all that work repairing generational trauma she deserves all
the sewing machines and skeins of yarn she wants. I just want to mention the yellow butterflies. They are an iconic piece of One Hundred Years of Solitude that have become a symbol for Colombia and magical realism, meaning the occurrence of life and joy in the middle of grim circumstances. I had a big smile when one of them showed up in the river by the end of the movie, it was kind of the same story told once again.

But the first time we saw a yellow butterfly was when they show Mariano in love with Isabela, resembling Mauricio Babilonia’s character in the book, who was always followed by yellow butterflies when in love.

Edit: my first award! Thank u! They really, really captured Colombia. Down to the father saying ""miercoles"" as a euphemism. The entire time the family was singing “We Don’t Talk About Bruno,"" all I could think of was, “Silenzio, Bruno!” Crossover universe between Luca and Encanto confirmed. I haven't seen it posted already so I'll just comment this: Mirabel's skirt/dress is beautifully animated, and it really popped to me during The Family Madrigal. Can't wait to see this again, probably in 3D this time. I loved this movie. Surface Pressure was definitely my favorite song. Bawled like a bitch throughout the movie. I was happy that there was no real villan. Its true the grandma was a huge fuckin asshole, but I wouldnt classify her as a villain. Just a dick. And once she had her eyes opened to how her dick behavior had negatively impacted her family, she changed. I do wish she had a more over time transition though. Kinda seems like she just got slapped in the face with the consequences of her actions and then was like ""oh shit what have I done"" and that was that. Otherwise, I had a great time seeing it and Ill prolly get it on dvd when its out So, I don't know if I'm crazy here, but everything on the internet is stating that there is ""no physical antagonist"" in this movie and that the antagonist is more thematic in terms of ""generational trauma"" but....Abuela Alma is like, ABSOLUTELY the antagonist here right?  Like, just because she learns her lesson doesn't make her behavior less downright toxic to the other members of her family for a healthy chunk of the movie... Just saw it, loved it. Some observations:

- The shape-shifting cousin had chameleons on his poncho. I didn't notice this til the end, but what a nice detail.

- Of course Bruno's visions are glass panes. What is glass made of? Sand.

- Recognized Abuela's voice from In The Heights immediately, which was cool. Didn't realize til afterwards that Mirabel was in the movie version as well.

- All the musical sequences. I'm a slut for musical sequences in animation and these were all incredible. We Don't Talk About Bruno is of course the stand-out one. Can't wait til that's on Youtube to rewatch it and soak in more of the animation details.

- Speaking of Bruno, I did think his character design looked a little young, which was kind of odd? I remember seeing shots of him in one of the trailers a few weeks ago and thinking ""okay, that guy's gotta be our love interest character"". Oops. My family and I have been singing ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" nonstop since last night.

Such an earworm. Question, Mirabel was basically ostracized because she didn’t have a gift and in her Abuela’s eyes could not help their community. But who the hell was Camilo helping with his gift? How can shapeshifting really help anyone? Honestly, I really loved it which is why it's shortcomings were so pronounced to me. The visuals were gorgeous, and the notion of having it set essentially in one house is a concept that I loved. The powers were all very cute and interesting. But the plot pacing was so, so strange. One major instance I can remember was >!the fight between the main character and the grandma!<. I feel like that should have happened halfway through the movie, but it happened like 85% in - it was resolved essentially immediately after. Or how >!the sisters can't stand each other, but after a short song they are completely in sync!<. The begining and end felt so brief, but the middle was really long. Don't get me wrong, it was the best part of the movie, but the pacing was really not doing it for me. I also felt that the music was tired and really unremarkable. The songs didn't push the plot forward much and felt like a desperate attempt to reach the top 10 charts. I know it's to be expected at this point, but it still was upsetting to hear. I can't remember a single song - even if you played it to me, I wouldn't be able to tell you it was in the movie. Bruno is a perfect character Kinda gets easily overlooked but can we appreciate the fact they actually had people of different skin tones in the family instead of easily making everyone white or the same tone. Accurate for Colombia. Did anyone else feel Pepa (aunty tied to the weather) was a subtle representation of mental illness? It seemed she always had clouds and was battling her anxiety throughout. I quite liked that it wasn't made into a big deal - it was (and is) just part of life. I realized something while watching this movie and it’s that I’m not a fan of how Disney animated their musical numbers anymore because of how many cutaways they have to something that doesn’t exist. Old Disney movies used to use songs to broaden the world. For example, One Jump Ahead in Aladdin making the streets of Agrabah come alive, A Girl Worth Fighting For from Mulan showing the Chinese countryside and the citizens that the army was protecting. The Circle of Life is probably the best example of this, showing us just how impressive the lions rule over the pride lands is and setting the stage perfectly for the rest of the movie.

Meanwhile, in modern Disney movies half of the songs don’t even take place in the setting they’re being sung in, characters are transported off to mystical dreamscapes where they fall through clouds and interact with metaphorical representations of what they’re singing about. See: You’re Welcome in Moana, Summer in Frozen, and Surface Pressure in Encanto. I dunno, I feel like it makes the world feel more shallow and thin for a few quick gags Lin Manuel Miranda's songwriting is so tied to his singing voice that I honestly couldn't listen to any of the songs in this movie without hearing his voice in the back of my head. What is happening at Disney? All their films recently feel like messes. Full of great ideas, great characters, beautiful imagery - but meandering stories struggling to link these things together. Is the plot an afterthought in development? I’m colombian, this movie was amazing. the fact that the family was displaced by violence is not something id ever see in a disney movie. Colombia has been in one conflict or another for like 100 years and most of the books that come out of Colombia are heavily related to that, is unfortunately, a huge part of what Colombia is. 

Also, i felt that the ashes were a reference to Armero, but that might be a stretch. 

Overall I’m severely pleasantly surprised, this was beyond my expectations and we’ll see it a few more times 


My fav song was dos orugas, tho it felt just so relatable because of my recent breakup. The grandmother scene where she explains her origins was just heartbreakingly beautiful. Not a dry eye in my theater i realized: does abuela have a gift? her central role is to act as the leader of the family without any additional assistance of magic guiding everyone else in her influence. if anything then mirabel wasn’t the first one to not be granted a direct power. she as herself is enough to lead others with love - she takes after her grandmother in this regard. her grandmother puts so much of their family’s success squarely on the magic thinking of herself as  not enough to take care of everyone depending on her without the magic. as much as the movie is about mirabel understanding she is enough the grandmother is enough as well. they are both worthy of the love of others without condition. This… wasn’t a good movie, it was ok at best.  It looked great, but the story and songs were just all off.  Nobody is going to be singing these songs like any of the 90s Disney classics. It's so beautiful to see my country represented like this, specially the Donkeycorn ",0,Encanto
78," I don't remember exactly what Jamie Lee Curtis said, but she mentioned early on how every daughter and father have their own game to communicate with each other, i guess for her it was invisible ink revealed by heat “🍩in a 🍩inside another 🍩” At the end when Daniel Craig was putting everything together I noticed that the knives behind the chair made a donut! And when he was explaining everything and sitting in the chair, his head perfectly filled the donut hole! I need to see it again but I think that when they were first interviewing people they never showed a camera angle where the person sitting in the chairs head filled the middle of the donut! The attention to detail in this movie was insane. Ana de Armas is definitely my favorite Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Uruguayan, Brazilian actress.

Edit: spelling ""She already ate the whole smoked salmon platter"" or whatever the line was absolutely killed me. Love unexpected old people jokes The best part of the movie is probably the end of the car chase when Marta gets away just by the skin of her teeth and the police cars have seemingly been trapped by debris or other things, and then we spend what feels like a full damn minute in the car with Marta and Ransom talking, and I’m thinking “Hurry! This is ridiculous if the cops don’t catch up!” and right as I’m thinking that, Blanc knocks on the car window with the rest of the fuzz pulling up behind him. So great I could listen to Daniel Craig talk about donuts and donut holes forever. The first time he said it, I laughed at how dumb it was. But he brought it back and it kept getting better. I really want a new series of murder mystery films with Daniel Craig’s character. He’s like the new, Southern Poirot. Was anyone else expecting a twist where Harlan would have been behind everything, orchestrating an elaborate suicide disguised as a murder, so as to leave one last mystery as his legacy? I called the medicine twist fairly early, but I honestly considered that he may have switched the bottles himself when he knocked the game board on the floor. Possibly as a test to see if Marta was as honest and trustworthy as he believed.

Thankfully, what we got was much better than any half ass twist I could come up with. my favorite running joke in the movie is how all the technology at Harlan’s House was extremely outdated. lmao he’s still rocking the ThinkPad with Windows XP, and the security cameras are all from the 80’s recording on 30 year old VHS tapes that cause the VCR to smoke

>”this security footage looks like a Japanese horror movie.. am I going to die in 7 days?” The whole Hugh/you revelation seemed like something out of Danganronpa. Loved how at the end she was standing above them all with the My House, My Rules cup. Briefly glimpsed The New Yorker on Ransom's coffee table during the scene in his house - great foreshadowing. Of all the funny lines the one that really got me for some reason was when Walt asked ""Like OJ Simpson?"" “I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you” might be one of my favorite lines. The scene where Walt is trying to manipulate Marta to give up the money by trying to make her scared of her mother being deported, and her then turning it around on him and saying, ""But you don't have any resources. I have all the resources. So I can use them to hire the fancy lawyers myself.""

*chef's kiss* My thoughts:

* Marta is a great main character. The quirk of her vomiting if she tells a lie is a great obstacle to throw at her and it does a good job of informing her character. My one issue with her character is that I wished we had spent more time with her family to give me some connection to them.

* The twist that Marta was the one who “murdered” Harlan would have been fantastic on it’s own, but combined with the twist that Ransom sabotaged her made me like it even more. I stopped considering the movie to be a murder mystery so I stopped speculating about the circumstances surrounding Harlan’s death and didn't think about how suspicious Ransom was. 

* I loved Thormberry family. The little interactions that reveal that they don’t actually care about Marta (not knowing what country she is from, all of them saying they wanted her at the funeral but that they got outvoted, Don handing her a plate that he was done with to take away) were perfect and I like the fact that their political affiliations didn’t stop them from being awful. Like Meg, who is the pinnacle of the ultra liberal Trump hating college student, is willing to blackmail her friend with getting her mom deported once her personal situation is threatened. I feel like Jacob was underutilized, but I think that with a cast this big someone was bound to get the short end of the stick. 

* Daniel Craig was fantastic, mostly because of his absolutely ridiculous accent.

* The humor was fantastic. The donut analogy and Ransom stabbing Marta with the fake knife, pulling it out and then slowly pushing it into her again were particularly hilarious gags that had the entire audience laughing their ass off, but even the minor gags like Blanc getting jumpscared by the grandma staring out the window were great as well. When Ransom and Marta are driving away 

>Ransom -  ""This may be the best thing that's ever happened to ALL of you!""

>Richard - ""What did he mean by that?

That fucking killed me holy shit. Jesus that car chase was so great and the way it ended was hilarious. Loved that Ransom calls her Baby driver I knew something was up with Chris Evans as soon as we first see him, because the dogs start barking at him. I mean obviously he's fishy but I knew there was always going to be another twist involving him. Earlier in the movie they mention that the dogs don't bark at Marta because they like/know her, and they don't bark at pretty much anyone else in the family. We hear dogs barking at one point on the night of the murder, and Blanc says at one point that dogs are a good judge of character. I know this is all super obvious stuff but... Yeah. I didn't call the twists, but I wasn't surprised when he ended up being the true villain. I will pay almost any price to see Daniel Craig doing a ridiculous accent and monologuing. DO YOU WANT DINNER NANA

DINNER? TO EAT? The theme of ‘building something from the ground up’ and the parallel American obsession with ‘old money’ (‘our birthright’) was so deftly done. They all profess to having achieved their success through their own grit but when the inheritance is yanked away they panic. It was also perfectly wrapped up by Blanc revealing that the ‘ancestral home’ was in fact purchased in the 1980s from a Pakistani businessman. *""I wanted you at the funeral, I was outvoted""*

10," Savant being portrayed as the focal member of the first team and coming across like a grizzled veteran, only to then cry, bail and be the one to get their head blown up was fantastic. There’s something just so funny about Pete Davidson playing the one to both double-cross the Squad AND be the first death as a result. We all knew Blackguard wasn’t gonna last, but Gunn used him perfectly IMO No one is mentioning Harley killing her fiance. I liked that bit. There were so many awesome hilarious moments but for some reason Polka Dot Man saying “oh fiddlesticks” was the part that really got me I love when bloodsport and his daughter were yelling about the TV watch she stole and she yells 

“IT DOES OTHER THINGS!” huh i just realized at no point did i go: oh king sharks looks fake. damn this movie's cgi is good I was hoping another character to be revived in the post credit scene.... Can we all acknowledge that the lady who knocked Waller the fuck out is a fucking hero. Taika Waititi only had one line but it still made me burst into tears Anyone else just fucking love David Dastmalchian? That dude is so good at playing outsiders and weirdos. Bummed we lost Polka-Dot Man but the plot of this movie is so wild I feel like there’s a chance we can see him again in the future. Polka-Dot Man's PoV is the stuff of nightmares, no wonder dude is batshit Pete Davidson going “ayo this a dog” still my fav thing That bit with Peacemaker walking by the sleeping dude and stabbing him a half dozen or so times was brutal. Cena is fuckin jacked My gf winced when the bird dies in the opening scene…


She had no idea what was coming next.. I was worried there like 3 or 4 separate times thinking my boy Nanaue died. ""Did anyone check on whether Weasel could swim?"" had me dying LOOOOOOL Milton didn't deserve to go down like that. Favorite scene was when the Squad is infiltrating the resistance camp and Bloodsport & Peacemaker are trying to outdo each other with flashy kills…just to find out they were accidentally killing the good guys the whole time. That scene was A+. [deleted] It’s a shame Flag didn’t make it, but we should have seen this coming when Katana didn’t join the squad, no wonder he died when there was no one there that had his back… RIP for my boy Milton. When he was on the end at the shot of the team walking through the rain I was rolling That scene where King Shark is goofing around with the jellyfish while everyone else was working on the important mission was great. My man Taika showing up with just one line to sum up ratcather. Man Starro being adapted to live action was absolutely horrifying ",0,The Suicide Squad
93," Oh this was wonderful. I thought the movie was great overall, but those last ten minutes were pure art The main character Jesper reminded me of Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove in good ways. 

Honestly, I think this film scratched an itch for films exactly like The Emperor's New Groove and to a lesser extent, The Road to El Dorado. Likeable characters, well-choreographed physical comedy, and gorgeous character animation. [deleted] I hadn't heard a single thing about this movie until I saw it on Netflix while I was browsing late last night.  I decided to check it out because I liked the animation style, and wow, I totally wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. A cute beautiful looking film

It's a shame it's not getting any buzz My favorite animated movie of the year.  The animation style is beautiful and the characters are very charismatic. Hope it becomes a Christmas classic with the time.
8.5/10 Best animated film of the year, hands down. You can’t get any better than quality hand-drawn 2D animation and a simple but effective story about redemption and hope.

Is it okay for me to say that this film felt more Disney-like than anything Disney’s put out in years? I know it’s because director Sergio Pablos worked on animation for some of the films during the Renaissance period, but still. It made me feel nostalgic in a way very few modern films have. I want more movies in the traditional style made. This was absolutely gorgeous! Pablos' work at Disney really shown through here. Beautiful movie. Maryu was the most adorable thing I've ever seen. With the PG rating is there anything that would spoil Christmas for the kids who are still believers? The wife decided she wanted to watch a Christmas tonight and thought here we go again, another movie i've seen umpteen times then I remembered this came out today. Showed her the youtube clip and so glad she said yes,

Twas myself, wife and 6 year old and then my 15 year came in after 15 minutes to watch it. Was surprisingly good and could watch it again nearer Christmas. As an ex-animator, i can safely say that Klaus has some of the most beautiful and spectacular looking animations, environments, characters and effects i have ever seen. The mix between 2D traditional animation and 3D CGI Lights, really give a stunning aesthetic.

The story is amazing, other than a few clichés (You'll know when you see it), the characters are lovely, although i would have liked a bit more development about them in some occasions. You will laugh, cry and love this movie.

9/10 Animation and lighting in the film is just incredible >!The little girl on the bridge as Jesper's boat leaves nearly broke me I swear!<

Great movie! Like many comments say; it seems like it might be boring but it will definitely catch you by surprise. Had some kuzco vibes with the main character The little Sami girl is so fucking adorable. I can't handle the cuteness! Animation

10/10. Beyond 10/10. This movie is a work of art.

Storytelling

8/10. Charming if a bit typical. No significant plotholes but nothing new or surprising, either.

Music choice

5/10. Shit was wack.

Overall

8.5/10, recommend as a MUST WATCH for lovers of all things animation. In terms of a movie itself, it's alright. You'll probably see the plot beats coming a mile away but they're all executed so well it doesn't even matter. Every character is endearing and it really gets to what the Christmas spirit should all be about, good will towards man. 

I have a soft spot for movies about people just being good to each other out of the kindness of their hearts and I shed a few tears watching this movie because of it (I'm also kind of a whimp to be fair). 

And on top of all that, the jokes pretty much all land, the animation style it truly gorgeous and the voice acting is top notch. This is right up there with Arthur Christmas as one of my favorite Christmas movies that I will be watching every year. 

Also side note, WATCH ARTHUR CHRISTMAS PEOPLE!!! It's unfortunate that movies like this no longer get a theatrical release. I get why they didn't release it in theaters, no way could it compete against the monster that is Disney (Frozen II in Nov and Star Wars in Dec). It's a shame though as this movie is a million times better than anything Disney has put out in years. Disney better watch their backs if Netflix can keep delivering animated stuff of this quality. [deleted] Such a good movie. The animation was gorgeous and the little girl Margu stole the show with her cuteness. I hope the lighting SPA pioneered with this film gets picked up by other studios. Christ the ending had me blubbering. I just finished it 5 minutes ago. I did not expect myself to be crying from the last 10 minutes. The animation is amazing as well. The plot isn't something new, but it's still good enough to watch. I hope we get to see more 2d films. I loved this movie. 9/10 Well, that was lovely. Overall I’d probably give it 8.5/10, it’s definitely going to be one of the better, if not *the* best, Christmas thing netflix puts out this year. The animation was lovely, particularly the backgrounds though I loved the character design, and the writing felt fresh and clever, surprisingly, managing not to rely on tropes too much. Also, I felt like the latter parts of the movie had better pacing than the first parts, but maybe it just took me a little while to get used to the art style and let myself get taken in by the whimsy. Every actor was also great, but the fact that they were famous definitely took me out a little (that’s a nitpick though). And oh fuck, that last scene broke me. The writers are excellent. 
  
My two main gripes would probably be music and general plot, though to me both of those stunk of executive meddling. I’ve found that when I’m watching or playing anything, I have a stronger emotional response to the music than others so perhaps this didn’t matter as much to others, but for me the use of music definitely wasn’t as good as it good be, though ranging from tear-jerking to generic to just straight up out of place. In fact, I’d say that sometimes the music contributed to the bad pacing in the first part of the movie because the later I didn’t feel that same tonal dissonance. The movie first truly gripped me when the first kid got his toy and they had that lovely moving shot... and then just after they played “How You Like Me Now” and I was just like O-O. Though I think the later use of pop songs was better (though not the best),  particularly when Margu got her sled. Then there were occasions when I felt like the score could’ve been from literally any movie and it took me out as well, but similar there was some great stuff too. Again though, it’s not like the *screenwriter* was the one who *desperately* begged to have How You Like Me Now, is it 🙃 
  
My second gripe is with the plot. Now, like I said I think the writing is excellent, but there were just some times when I felt like there were tropes where there didn’t need to be, for example Jesper’s 6000 blowing up in his face. See, I still feel like that must’ve been notes from higher up tho, because the writers just had too many amazing moments for that to be them, imo. Like I said, the ending, but also things like the kids’ relationships, and Alva’s storyline, and Klaus’ backstory, and Margu getting her sled etc.  
  
Despite how much I just wrote about those two things (lol) I still feel like this movie was great, they’re just minor gripes. I would pay to see this movie in cinemas and not be one bit disappointed, which is saying a lot considering what Netflix typically produces. Strong recommend ",0,Klaus
12," “You’re projecting a lot of misogyny for a future women’s march organizer.” 75 minute long anxiety nightmare. Loved it. The music was really something Thought this movie was fantastic. Reminded me of Uncut Gems but with just a completely different setting and scale. Gasped a few times as complications were piled on (getting the phone back was brilliant!). Kinda want to rewatch it just to soak in the tension. Shiva Baby is a GREAT debut! Shows some everyday realities of being female, college-aged, and belonging to a “liberal”-minded, but still quite overwhelming, Jewish family niche in the modern world. And I think it shows the insular world of this particular tiny slice of humanity—Jewish-American college girls, so well. 

Even small, very subtle details, like, for instance, Danielle’s straightened hair at the beginning of the movie with Max, vs her natural hair, for the rest of it, are a punch. Straightening hair (read: damaging hair) is a rite of passage  in “coastal elite Jewish-American girl” culture. Many Jewish girls have naturally curly, unruly hair, coming into conflict with what society, especially younger society, thinks female hair should look like. The fact that Danielle had specifically straightened her hair for her sugar daddy date already shows me her mentality: nobody wants a sugar baby with curly, “unsexy,” “Jew” hair. It tells me that Danielle is the type of girl who desperately wants to feel beautiful, and is also the type to conform to society’s standards in order to do so.  All that, and more, from the first 5 minutes of the movie. 

To paraphrase Jon Frosch from Hollywood Reporter, it ain’t “The Hours”-deep, nor is it prolly really meant to be, as a comedic horror movie. Notwithstanding, really enjoyed the nuanced ways the movie brought up different themes, even if it didn’t explore them as much as I’d have liked to see. And it does play on stereotypes quite a lot. But, in the end, the actors are so great in their stereotyped roles, you’re left remembering your own “shiva baby-like” family encounter, no matter if you pronounce it “rugelach” or “arugula.” impressive debut feature This was great, so funny, tense and awkward. Can't wait to see more from this young director “oh so you can run marches, like with the pink pussy hats?” Not watching this ever again. It just made me feel sick.  


Great film though. The best way I could pitch this film is that it's Noah Baumbach meets the Safdie Brothers with the Judaism somehow doubled. Pretty great actually. My only complaint would be the compositions are so whacky, floaty and hand held that sort of diminish the effort a bit as a whole. I know they are thematically tied to the anxiety inducing vibe, but I've been noticing that a lot of filmmakers utilise the technique in many new films, basically for the same reasons, and I'd argue that there are other much more exciting ways to convey chaos through composition. 

There's certainly an argument to be had that there isn't a single memorable shot in the film, and, considering we are talking about the cinematic medium, that's a little unfair to an otherwise great story, with focused performances. Enjoyable quick film, funny and cringe. Felt old when they referred to  Dianna Agron as old lol Super good dialogue. A bit of it hit a little close to him so I don’t see myself watching again. Some of the camera work was really shaky especially in the beginning. But the main actress was fantastic. I know this movie is getting heavy praise particularly for it's bisexual representation, but for me, I loved it for it's Jewish-American representation. Just everything about it perfectly captured the vibe I always feel at extended family events that I don't really wanna be at because I barely know anyone.

Everything from the decor of the house to the food on the table brought back memories for me, and the whole ""Jewish family gathering edited as a horror movie"" really felt relatable. >""*Did I say this was a love story? No. It's a horror movie*."" - **Deadpool**

This film is as chaotic and stress inducing as '**mother!**' minus the supernatural fantasy elements and metaphors. Cringe, but in a deliberately fun way. I see it described everywhere as a young woman encounters her ""sugar daddy"" at a shiva. Even since the short film that had been the pitch.

But is there any setup for it actually being a ""sugar baby"" type scenario? It just seems like she is a prostitute and he is a client. That was great. Not many movies can pull off the couple of hour time frame without feeling forced. Good acting and good direction. Mazel tov! Thoroughly enjoyed it, the dialogue was very Baumbach-esque. The entire movie felt like Mother! meets Frances Ha As a neat freak person this film was agonising to watch. No personal space.. everyone needed a good shower.. I wanted to go out and get some air. Made me appreciate my not so close ties with my family. Good movie indeed I don't think I've seen a movie that so accurately reflected my own personal anxieties of growing into adulthood than this. All those expectations of family and even family acquaintances and feeling like all you're going to do is disappoint them. I love how the director was going to take what in other instances would feel like a result of a small budget with the really tight handheld camera and make it a stylistic choice that adds to that stressful tone of the movie. 

I'm glad this seems to be getting such a warm reception cause I really want Emma Seligman to have the opportunity to make more stuff like this that has such a strong sense of purpose and voice. It was a great movie but one part has me baffled. What was Kim going to give Danielle when she asked her to hold the child. Apparently it seemed important because she didn't want max to have the child either. Kim gave her back her phone. I assume Kim saw her sugar daddy business popped up on the phone also, so was she going to assist her? Give her tips? I'm really surprised that scene didn't continue.

Any suggestions? Another great social anxiety simulator. Not quite on the level of 'mother!, but close at times. Just loved the performances and the constant escalation. I just watched the film yesterday. It was great! The tension build up was amazing. I loved it!!! That is not correct pronunciation of ARUGULA I'll watch this just for having the guts to use unconventional but still attractive woman as the lead, but everyone knows the a real sugar daddy usually looks like Fred Melamed or close to that.

Older rich *attractive* guys either have mistresses (who cost more) or trophy wives (who cost A LOT more). ",0,Shiva Baby
70," One thing that gets overlooked is Pheonix gives and creates 2 iconic laughs during this performance. 

His laugh he's self inflicted with that comes up when he's distressed (which is amazing, especially how he ends up almost choking on it) and his other psychotic laugh that he forces when he thinks he's meant to be laughing at social cues (even though he doesn't actually know why he's laughing) like at the comedy club and when his co-workers are making fun of the little person.

SOO GREAT!

[Edit: my first silver! Thank you kind stranger] One small detail I loved in the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne- her pearls.  Every other time, the ripping off of her pearls has been done out of greed, because they were valuable.  But here, her killer rips them off out of rage and disgust, like ""fuck your ridiculous pearls, you fucking one-percenter."" Loved the fact that the Joker didn’t actually physically kill Bruce’s parents, but still caused their death. Really nice touch. Also really appreciated  how graphic the murders were. They were realistic to the point of being unsettling. 

The film made sure that viewers didn’t want to be the joker. It wiped away any sort of romanticism some people may have about “being crazy.” I always thought that the joker should not be a character people admired, and this film made sure that you didn’t. 

Bravo The flashback of Arthur’s mom at Arkham responding to the accusation that she had him tied up to a radiator, severely malnourished and beaten.

“He always seemed... so happy.”

Something about that made my heart drop. Because you just think of all of the scenes where he’s clearly in so much pain and misery, but he just can’t stop “laughing.” > I forgot to punch out.

I dont know why but I loved that scene. Anyone with a shit job has had that fantasy. > All it *takes* is *one bad day* to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. 

I only saw the film once so forgive me if I was wrong, but on Arthur's bad day he:

\- Lost his supposed father (Thomas Wayne saying he is adopted and not his son);

\- His mom has a  heart attack;

\- Murray, a father figure for him, mocks him on TV;

\- Discovers his mom is not really his mom, and that he was adopted and abused as a child;

\- Discovers he doesn't really have a girlfriend, and how much of a bad mental state he is.

All that topping an already mentally unstable and unmedicated man. The shot of him smiling while his boss is bitching him out about the sign was amazing yet terrifying. I feel like Clowns have to be Bruce Wayne's biggest fear in this universe, so one must assume he actually goes on to become Clownman Just got back from the theatre. 

Hot damn, give Joaquin all those freaking awards NOW—even if he doesn’t like them so much. I mean, supposedly they give those out for *the* best actor and if that wasn’t some fine acting then I don’t know what is.  

For me, Joaquin the actor disappeared around ten minutes in. He completely embodied this whole new identity throughout the film and when the Joker formally emerged towards the end, I swear to god I lost it. I got teary-eyed during his rant with Murray and even at the end, when he painted a smiley on his face with his own blood. 

Phew, I obviously have a lot to process still. Just...bravo to JP and the whole team behind Joker. Maybe this was mentioned already but did anyone notice the numerical countdown that was in the movie? I noticed the first number (9) as the platform number at the train station where he killed the last of the wall street guys. After that the ones I can remember were 8 for Zazie's apartment, 6 is the train platform when two detectives are chasing him, 4 on the wall behind DeNiro at the studio as he chats to Joker before he goes on, 3 was the camera that was focused on joker during the scene, 2 was one of the news stations reporting the shooting on all the TVs and I think 1 was represented by the ""Ace in the Hole"" billboard in the background after the crash and at the birth of Joker. The best part for me was watching Joker take notes about what other people perceive as funny because he doesn’t have the same associations. That and him immediately ending his laugh when he turned down the hall at work. ""Don't you have to be funny to be a comedian"" got audible gasps in my theater. That chaotic train scene chase was perfect and the best part for me tbh. Perfect example of the joker using chaos to his advantage This is kinda really stupid, but did anyone notice the wicker chair one of the joker protesters was waving around when Joker was on top of the police car at the end? I just kept focusing on the idiot that brought a wicker chair to a riot.. Sure I could believe someone waving a bat, hammer, or something else. There was just someone with a big wicker chair waving that thing around. I thought it was hilarious and wanna know did anyone else notice that? I feel like I haven’t seen Robert DeNiro have so much fun in a long time. He really sealed this film. Watching him and Phoenix verbally spar was glorious. Just wanted to point out, he never eats anything in the film.

Multiple times he is about to eat and then something happens that causes him to get more stressed and he immediately starts smoking a cigarette. If Joaquin Phoenix's shoulder blades don't get an Oscar for this film, why do they even have awards? The scene where he dropped the gun at the hospital had me rolling. And his reaction was just on point. Two things I was very happy about:
1. It’s totally unclear whether or not Arthur is Thomas’ son (and Bruce’s half brother)
2. Arthur/Joker didn’t kill the Wayne’s

I also like that the whole movement he inadvertently becomes the head off, was in fact, created by the media - very meta with (I swear) the media currently almost begging for someone to shoot someone in relation to this film so as to create a narrative . It's ok Arthur, sometimes I imagine that Zazie beetz is my girlfriend too... As soon as the the Wayne family walked out of the theater, I was like ""well shit, here we go again"". Joker was planning on killing himself when he was a guest in Murray's show, right? But he had a change of heart after Murray just made fun of him on live television? One of the primary event which snaps him completely was the fact that he initially wanted to suicide at the live show but because they made fun of even his ""knock, knock"" joke - his last joke which he wanted for himself, made him reaaaally lose it. Anything the Joker does after that fits so perfectly - he doesn't care if he dies, everything seems to be a joke to him. TDK and all other versions fit perfectly post the suicide joke gone wrong. Just love it Joker’s biggest nemesis won’t be Batman. It’ll be lung cancer. 

Edit: Punctuation i felt the reason he was sympathetic towards the midget is because he *understood* him, in the sense that the midget was seen as a joke within his entire presense of the movie, as no one took him seriously because of his height just like how people didn't take arthur seriously because of his mental illness (and his character altogether). 

this is further emphasised by how the midget couldn't reach the door lock, which appeared to be comedic to the audience, but to the joker he saw someone who was forced into a life of hardship with no say of his condition just like joker himself. ",1,Joker
108," I love how Miles copied the moves of the deceased Spider-Man at the end to climb the collider and the others are just staring, wondering who taught him that. It was an extremely cool callback to the beginning and oddly heartwarming. We complained about how many times we had to watch Uncle Ben die, and now we’re being punished by having to watch Peter Parker die twice in one year  I think one of my favorite parts of the movie was that while it managed to be hilarious and silly, but they never undercut the important moments with humor. The film took itself seriously when it needed to.  Doc Ock's design is RIDICULOUSLY thoughtful and wonderful. Her plasticky/rubbery arms move more like an octopus than regular ock's. And the hair in profile looks just like an octopus head. I'm so happy Liv exists. I loved that Jake-Spider-man was so experienced that everything was monotonous, but he had the skill to back it up, and I love that he was still supportive of Miles even while saying that he wasn't going to the final battle.

Like, as he grabbed him and said ""So just show me that you can turn invisible or use your venom strike on command or *something* to get by me."" This film had so many great moments:

* Each Spider person's history being essentially the same but still giving depth and background to each character.
* Everything Spider-Noir
* Pete and Miles relationship development. ""I'm so proud of you!... Do I want kids?!""
* ""*Sleeeeeeep*""
* The animation and montage when Miles creates the suit and swings through the city the first time

I could go on and on. This film is incredible. I really hope that people go and see it so that Sony Animation continues to make these as you could tell they really put some heart and soul into this one. Am I the only one that was kind of scared of miles uncle lmao his theme song when he was chasing him was scary I can’t believe they referenced the Spider-Man pointing meme ""That's all Folks""

""Is he allowed to say that? Like, legally?"". Just got out from the first showing at my theater. Really visually great and funny movie! I wish our latter three Spiders got showcased some more but this movie was pretty long as it is I guess.

I’d be all up for more inter-dimensional shenanigans in a sequel.

Stay for the credits! This movie deserves an Oscar  [deleted] Everyone is rightfully praising all the Spider-People, but I was so happy they got the villains right. Kingpin taking up the entire frame! Green Goblin being an actual GOBLIN! The Doc Oc reveal!!!  The Prowler would have to be my favorite though. I loved the animation of his movement. I loved the score that accompanied him whenever he showed up. And I REALLY loved that they made him actually SCARY - wasn’t expecting genuine jump scares in this movie. I’ll be seeing this a dozen more times. ""SPIDER-MAN POINTED FIRST, OBVIOUSLY"" Couldn't stop laughing at that whole bit. Best part: when they’re running out of Alchemax, Miles throws a bagel back at the scientists, and it hits one in the head followed by the little comic bubble saying “*Bagel!*” ""Ok one of us has to be responsible and sacrifice themself to get the rest home"" 

*all Spider-people simultaneously volunteer without hesitation*

FUCK these guys get it I couldn't believe they actually officially addressed the emo dance scene.  Drinking game for everything Kingpin shows up in: Take a drink every time he says VANESSA! Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had to pay the ultimate price and die for this film to be made. That 2099 tease. You whip out Oscar Issac to torture us? Sony should stick to this form of filmmaking for the Spider-Man universe and let Marvel Studios handle the live action adaptions. Stuff like this is super heartfelt and original, loved every minute of it.

Had me rolling with “I found out I was dead. And blonde.” Kingpin is an absolute U N I T Absolutely AMAZING. I swear I can make a poster out of every scene of this movie. It’s just stunningly beautiful. Love the characters. Love the humor. Love the actions and fighting sequences. I love this movie. 

(I can’t really believe this came out of the same studio that made the emoji movie.)

 Okay but how fucking amazing was that title sequence That after credits scene was pure perfection, I love it when the memes become self-aware. ",0,Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse
148," Charles told clone Wolverine about how that was one of the best nights he's had in a long time, but the real Logan never knew how much Charles appreciated that dinner. Wolverine's leap is the greatest shit ever  [removed] One of the best moments of the movie was when suddenly out of the blue, Laura started speaking Spanish and began fighting with Logan after being mute for more than half of the movie. You know I think that part where Logan tried to crash through the fence is the first I've ever seen that fail.  Normally the fence goes down like it was paid to lose. Magneto was right I loved all the subtle references that gave us a glimpse into the future; tigers are extinct, self-driving tractor trailers and the mass-consumption of corn syrup.  Patrick Stewart looked like he was enjoying the ""grumpy cheeky old bastard"" role so much, but Dafne Keen knocked it out of the park. Incredible acting.

Going to miss Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.   Yukio in **The Wolverine** (2nd film) 

> *I saw you die. A while ago. But it's not like I get a complete picture. More like looking through a keyhole. But I'm always right. All I can see is one part of a person's life... their death. And I saw yours.* 
*I see you on your back. There's blood everywhere. You're holding your own heart in your hand.* 

 Logan died on his back, holding his daughter's hand. [deleted] How badass was that hotel scene with Logan just stabbing the fuck out of the dudes while they were frozen? I also loved how the very first 5 minutes of the movie were just so brutal and opened with him saying fuck. It was like a preview of things to come. I thought one of the saddest moments was when they're leaving the casino with all the people on the floor and Prof X weakly says ""I'm sorry. I'm very sorry."" Loved the final moments of Logan's life, when they called back to him and Xavier's final conversation. I'm paraphrasing here but Xavier said something along the lines of ""this is what I wanted for us, to have a home, being surrounded by the people who love you, you should take a moment and feel what it's like Logan, it's not too late for you"". So when Logan, on his dying breaths said ""huh, so that's what it feels like"" I was absolutely crushed.  It wasn't too late for him, after countless years of pain and suffering he finally experienced love even if it was just for a few fleeting moments. This is the perfect film to show why it's important that not every superhero movie should be about saving the world. The stakes felt more real here than in the other big movies. They took a big risk having such a young kid play such a pivotal role and it totally paid off. Dafne Keen was absolutely *phenomenal*. And for such a young actress! I am totally ready for a Wolverine/Laura/X-23 spin-off starring Keen.

Nice spin on the Old Man Logan story where [Charles is the one who killed the X-Men](#spoiler).

I really enjoyed this. I'm sad to see Jackman go, but this was a good note to go out on. I'm curious to see where they go next. I think Patrick Stewart needs to be nominated for Best supporting actor.  I let out an audible, ""Holy shit,"" when X-23 was impaled in the chest with that harpoon gun.  I don't think I've ever seen such centerfold gore happen to a child on-screen for a Hollywood movie.  

Dafne Keen definitely brought the right level of ferocity and physicality to X-23.  Those blood curdling battle screams... When he was burying Professor Xavier and was having trouble speaking, I was about to lose it. Hugh Jackman is an incredible actor and captured that pain so perfectly. Wolverines story is a tragedy, and the way they portrayed that was perfect. He's been through hell, and you feel that. You really feel how tired he is. 

""So that's what it feels like"".

When he said that, my eyes watered up. He was finally happy.


Gosh that was a fucking beautiful movie.  Gotta comment again, holy shit it was so good.

Really interesting/terrible how they showed Xavier's decline due to whatever condition he had (ALS/Alzheimer's?). When X24 killed him, it really tore me apart when Logan was telling him ""it wasn't me"" when he was carrying him to the truck, knowing he was probably so confused. In the end he just wanted to get to the sea...

Also tore me up when laura finally called him daddy. Fuck...

Such great world building tho, really felt like an accurate, solid depiction of what 2029 will be, realistically. The self driving 18wheelers were a nice touch.

I could go on and on, but y'all saw it, y'all know what all I'll say lol I didnt realize this until a couple hours after I watched but Logan wanted the boat so he can take Charles (and himself) away from innocent people. If he has another seizure, there's no people he can hurt in the middle of the sea. I can't believe how incredible Dafne Keen was as X-23, I hope she gets the chance to play the character more.

Also, that opening with Deadpool was amazing!

Edit: I guess some theaters didn't show it, but there was a scene with Deadpool before the movie started.  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ezsReZcxU) the official version for those that missed it. The sequence where Wolverine stumbles through everyone being still because of Charles' seizure at the hotel was an incredible scene I went to the first showing today at the IMAX in Lincoln Square (NYC). They were only letting people in by groups of 20. Weird, right? I turn the corner and HUGH JACKMAN shakes my hand and goes, ""Hi - enjoy the film"" - he greeted every fan one by one as we entered. 


OH. AND THE MOVIE WAS SICK!


EDIT: Grammar. Patrick Stewart broke my heart. ""Our boat...""

Hugh Jackman broke my heart. ""So this is what it feels like...""

Dafne Keen broke my heart. ""Daddy..."" Favorite bit was that the real wolverine had genuine fear in his eyes when he realized he was basically fighting himself in his prime. 

Made you realize just how dangerous a real savage wolverine is.  ",0,Logan
122," I thought it was fantastic! I was tearing up constantly, particularly when he invited Officer Clemens, to wash his feet with him, then they showed the context of the chemicals being thrown in pools. The juxtaposition of that video with Mr Rogers’ pure kindness and care brought me to tears.

I also loved the ending, beautifully crafted by the director so that the audience realizes what’s happening as the people close to Mr Rogers reflect during that minute, and us in the audience reflect ourselves.

Nobody in my theater stood up immediately. I think it’s because nobody wanted to leave the comfort of Mr Rogers’ neighborhood and go back into the divided world we live in now. But I think this documentary came at a perfect time, because we could all learn a little from Mr Rogers right now. I found this pretty challenging honestly. I went in expecting it to be a retrospective and nostalgic look at how we need Mr. Rogers in today's divided culture, but the end it asks ""What are you going to do to carry on what he did?""

I found that really powerful. Mr. Rogers kept coming back to television later in his life due to a personal responsibility he felt. We shouldn't need Mr. Rogers to come back because we saw him teaching it all to us. So that we can be the change. 

Just something that really hung with me. Francoise's realization that Mr. Rogers had been telling him he loved him for 2 years, and saying that that was the first time he'd been told that by another man, was heartbreaking. For some reason, seeing them both as older men yet Francoise viewing him as his surrogate father really got to me. I really liked that Mr. Rogers wasn't portrayed as a perfect saint, they included his failures, depression, and self-doubt. The use of the footage of him on a Nantucket beach to portray him briefly succumbing to his self-doubt, then standing back up and continuing to move forward was very powerful. > After Credits Scene? Yes, Paddington recruits Mr. Rogers into the nicecore universe

A man of culture who reads David Ehrlich as well, I see I saw this movie the day the Koko the Gorilla died. A lot of people in my theater very audibly were touched a lot by her small part in the film. Absolutely incredible film  Started crying about two minutes in, cried through the rest of the movie. Just an absolute wreck. I know he wasn't a perfect man, but honestly, he was such a good man, and an important man. Watching this movie just felt so special and lovely. ""Was I a mistake?""

Cue the tears So many beautiful scenes. When Daniel asks ""What does assassination mean?"", I immediately teared up. You could just feel the tragedy behind that episode and how everykone felt watching it. Especially since they made such a point of showing that Mr. Rogers showed himself in Daniel -- he himself truly had trouble comprehending why someone would assassinate.

Also, the scene when Daniel sings about his insecurities of being ""a mistake"" and Lady Aberlin joins in with a song about how she loves him for who he is was amazing, sad yet beautiful. The harmony they formed was actually chilling. The scene where he looks straight at the camera and says something to the effect of “people are telling you what you need to be. And they are wrong. I will tell you”. Man. What a wholesome badass The one case of learning how the sausage gets made that actually makes you want more sausage.

I didn't want this movie to end. - Tissues were at the theater door. They knew.

- Mom left dry-eyed, but enjoyed the movie. She was confused at why I wanted to see this, having not really paid much attention to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood when I was a kid. I told her the best way I could explain it was that my generation tends to look for tangible moral heroes, especially now, and Fred Rogers is a famous example of someone we want to see more of.

- I didn't cry as much as I thought I would (the trailer made me tear up, so I was prepping to be a sobbing mess), but it did happen. Clemmons' story of his loneliness when coming out, Fred Rogers telling him to keep his homosexuality a secret, and then stating ""I love you"" for two years to him broke me. Did anyone else feel like they glossed over that just a tad? Did Rogers ever state his specific feelings on homosexuality?

- It astounded me that Rogers was still unsure if he was a good person at the end. 

- The main thing that made Fred Rogers the most relatable is how unsure he was about himself. He had done all this good, and felt he hadn't done enough. 

- I got a twinge of anger at the protest at his funeral and the jabs at his effeminacy. Like, just . . . why? It's also good for this movie to come out to show a registered Republican who was a Christian who saw the good in people. God, why can't we have that anymore?

- Oh Daniel. I miss you. >Your Tears as Constantly Happening

Great casting choice. When Daniel asked if he was a mistake, I lost it because that duet with Lady Aberlin was so beautiful and it was something I needed to hear especially since I suffer from anxiety and worry and when I took a minute to think about the special people in my life, I sobbed so so much. 

Thank you Mr Rogers for loving everyone so much There Will Be Tears  Ugly crying everywhere in my theatre by the end. Tried to hold strong, but between Fred Rogers  actually experiencing doubt after 9/11 and the story behind Daniel Tiger and a whole bunch of other stuff I just couldn’t. Beautifully executed documentary that ended up being the warm hug I need right now. Things are fucked up right now.  I bet Fred Rogers, Bob Ross, Julia Child, Steve Irwin, Jim Henson, Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo), and Sheri Lewis (And her friend Lamb Chop) are all having a friendly conversation and having alot of fun with each other in the afterlife.  All seven of them were childhood icons for each generation and makes me sad that kids of today won't experience these type of people again. Especially since they were all so kind and are hard to dislike and were all were one of a kind that's missing from today's television. 

Can't wait for the upcoming Mr Rogers movie with Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers.


 The news interviewer talking to Daniel, then saying something like ""that's really something"" was an unexpected little wholesome moment. His eyes were gleaming and he had a genuine smile, I feel like I saw his childhood self come back. While I find the movie amazing and definitely recommend it to anyone interested, it still hurts to see that even someone like Mr. Rogers didn’t know how to fully comprehend the magnitude of 9/11 when it happened. It really was tough as someone to watch that considering that’s the time when we needed someone like him the most. Spoiler: Mr. Rogers was a stand up guy.  Saw it Tuesday and it was an interesting look not only for television history, but American history as well. Between talking about Vietnam the first week on the air, Mr. Rogers and Officer Clemons in the pool, and Daniel Tiger asking about the word assassination, it was crazy to see how much was mature subjects were covered.  

Also, holy crap, that scene where Daniel references depression was a solid gut punch. Was not anticipating that and it really stuck out to me the most It really struck out to me that even Fred Rogers had his doubts on occasion. He wondered if he was making a difference, if he was doing a great job, if he could adjust properly. It goes to show that he too was human, and that we **can** strive to be like him even if we doubt ourselves. Wonderful film. Two observations:

I've been in many films where the audience spontaneously applauded at the end but I've been in very few where they spontaneously applauded at some point in the middle of the film, but when they showed the clip of Mr. Rogers convincing Senator Pastore to continue funding for PBS the audience broke out into applause.

I was previously familiar with the significance of Mr. Rogers sharing a pool with Officer Clemmons on the show but it was only when watching the clip and watching Mr. Rogers wash Clemmons' feet that I remembered that washing the feet of the apostles is one of the acts Jesus performs in the gospels.  I don't know if that's what Mr. Rogers was thinking of when he did that but it made me realize just how much he lived in imitation of Christ. If that last scene didn’t bring you to tears, you have no soul.  I love how people in my theater snapped in time with Mr. Rogers while he was singing ""It's such a Good Feeling"". That was heart warming to hear. 

Maybe it's the nostalgia, maybe it's the current political climate we're living in, or maybe it's because I've had a really rough couple of months (mentally and emotionally) but man, was I overwhelmed with emotions. 

Earlier in the year, I had a hard time convincing myself that I wasn't a failure. I would go into intense crying fits before going to sleep, repeating things like ""I can't do it, I can't do it"", and I was making life much more difficult than it had to be. So seeing these archived clips of Mr. Rogers' wisdom and songs just hit me right in the heart. 

I have a great supportive family and friends, but it was something else hearing this good man lend his encouragement and love. Selfishly, I really needed this and I'm so happy Morgan Neville made this film. I haven't had a movie experience like this in a long time.  ",0,Won't You Be My Neighbor?
123," Melissa gives easily the best performance of her career, one that is absolutely worthy of an Oscar nomination, maybe more than just that.  But Richard E Grant stole every scene and if he isn’t nominated for Supporting Actor I will fucking riot. The film is unbelievably good. Such a fantastic surprise. Also features a great Paul Simon song - Can’t Run But I was so surprised by this movie. It's not so much a biopic as a deeply empathetic look at loneliness. This is easily Melissa's best performance which is too bad because she's blown out of the water by Richard E. Grant. He nailed a certain kind of gay man that died off during the AIDS crisis. He was so lively yet such a tragic figure who wouldn't let that define him. And just in general it was perfect at representing the struggles of being older and queer and feeling the community leave you behind.

Also it was so interesting how Lee was the architect of her own destruction. That scene at the end of the date where Anna goes in for a kiss and she refuses her is so tragic. She knows she damages people but she can't help wanting to feel love. What a brutal character moment in a single scene.  Richard Grant was the best part of this movie, not that Melissa McCarthy wasn't amazing as well. I absolutely loved this film! For me, 2018 has been a highly disappointing year for movies (but I shouldn't complain, since 2017 was my personal favorite year in film). I have to say, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is my favorite film of the year. I really wanted to cry when Lee's cat died. Melissa is terrific, and I loved her friendship with Jack. Lovely cinematography and some comedy thrown in. Great film!!! This was a good movie, I really liked it. Mccarthy and Grant are amazing!! The scene where she finds the cat almost made me cry.  Both Grant and McCarthy have great chances of being nominated at the Oscars but especially at the globes. Best performance of McCarthy career and I'm not a big fan of her but I loved her performance. 

The whole cat part of the film made me sad :(. I'm not even all the way through but had to pause to tell someone how much I love this movie already.

The script really hits the spot, the acting is flawless, no masterful. I'm not quite feeling the pacing so far, but that's not all too much of an important thing to me anyway.

The characters, and their relationships are magic. Really authentic. Almost as if I'd been there myself.

&#x200B;

Kudos to everyone who made this such a special movie. Found this movie to be delightful! Reminded me of an old woody allen movie, and the writing of Holofcener was evident throughout.

Heller’s direction was wonderful here and she kept the pacing of the movie moving quite nicely.

McCarthy was fantastic, as was Grant. He might be my favorite for supporting actor. Both Oscar noms were much deserved! Holy shit that last scene between Grant and McCarthy. Grant in that scene. You can see the battle between his life’s charade and his current illness right in his eyes. What an enjoyable movie. The more I think about it the more I enjoyed it. I kept hearing how this was Melissa McCarthy's serious role, but I also thought the movie was very funny and witty.

I wasn't paying attention when she said the cat feeding directions. They focused on the cat food, did Jack follow the instructions Lee gave him?  That dinner scene between Lee and Anna really struck a chord with me. Can’t really explain why but it did. The scene that made me happiest in this movie was when she kicked her friend out of the apartment after she was told it smelled really bad and he still knocked on the door and offered to help clean up and that he didn't mind. It was very.....I don't l know, it just made me happy. Anyone knows name of the song sang by cross-dresser singer at the bar?

Great Movie, BTW, capture the lonely mood really well. This was decent. I could easily see Grant & McCarthy nab up a bunch of nominations (and maybe even a Golden Globe win or two). 

If anything, this is a reallllly good sign for the Mr. Rogers biopic with Tom Hanks next year. Marielle Heller's got insane potential. I loved this. McCarthy's performance was incredible, as was Grant's. The writing was great, too. Just delightful.  I've been wanting to see this, but our arthouse theater just got rid of it.  Damn!  That scene where she holds her dead can is fucking devastating. 

The loneliness in this film is so palpable from the first five minutes, when she gets fired I would have liked to know more about Jack Hock - where he lived, his life, how he knew Israel...he's sympathetic and enjoyable thanks to Grant but he's also difficult to like b/c we know he gives Lee away and is at least somewhat responsible for her death. 

I haven't read the book but I suspect he was even worse than Hock in the film, and much less charming than Grant. (Anyone who read the memoir know otherwise?) What did Grant mean when he said ""teeth are dead giveaway"" after he got his bleached?  Yeah this was the best acting I have seen from her, when she finds the cat awww.  I cried at this scene! ""Will you make me 29...""  He did. He broke every other rule, but he remembered to break up the pills in the food.  im with you here..  
the dialogue was spot on. i mean it was so authentic. im still confused if they were into each other or not and i felt all the insecurity and the questions and the what ifs and all that. amazing. Goodnight, Ladies. Originally by Lou Reed. ",0,Can You Ever Forgive Me?
34," The first twenty minutes of Anthony Hopkins performance should be enough to convince you of his Oscar. It seriously is on par with Silence Of The Lambs.

The movie is so unique as well, I have never seen a movie deal with declining mental health while intertwining intrigue in a respectful manner.

Shout out to Olivia Colman as well who was the glue to hold the whole thing together. There's a beat at the end where the nurse offers to take him out for a walk and I realised I couldn't say for sure that she's even the nurse. Maybe it's Anne, I honestly don't know. It's a really impressive indication of immersion when you've got the audience thinking like that.

Also, this is a more impressive and thematically appropriate distortion of time than Tenet, change my mind. No disrespect to Chadwick Boseman, but I really hope there's either a tie or Hopkins pulls an incredible upset. It's his greatest performance since Silence of the Lambs, absolutely broke my heart, and I won't forget it. Olivia Colman is yet again brilliant as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if she also sneaks in a few awards. 

But this is one fucking terrifying experience. Especially if you've seen a loved one go through this same experience. It also perfectly captures how horrible and frustrating it is to have to see it happen. 

Usually, in these types of films, we are looking from the outside in, but instead, this is more of a dementia simulator. The thought of losing my mind like that is horrifying and this film presents it in such a powerful and effective way that I haven't quite seen before. I loved it. Me, sobbing uncontrollably: ""Is that all you got, Hopkins"" This movie was absolutely fantastic. I wish more people would talk about it. Anthony Hopkins delivers one of his best performances of all time. That last scene from him alone is worth an Oscar. the central metaphor is placed on a watch, there is a loose grip of reality held by anthony as time is shattered fragmentation. he grows dependent on an object that is supposedly a reliable, tangible constant, but is unable to keep track of it due to dementia and time slips through his fingers quite figuratively and literally.

clever cinematography; the moving chamber effect inspired double takes at every juncture and led me, an able-minded and youthful viewer to grow increasingly dazed, confused, distressed. unexpectedly, i felt like i was watching a horror film, psychologically manipulated and scammed by false realities, leaving me feeling daft and dim. the father captured an inaccessible lens of the older generation, installing an unforgettable perspective that we often dismiss guiltlessly, without so much as a second thought. 

this film is a necessary watch for all. everyone has a parent, a grandparent, an elder in their life. corporeality can become so fragile and we will never truly comprehend the point of collapse until we witness it firsthand — and even then, we still only see a glimpse of the trauma, incertitude and fear real people face. however, while most of us can never completely empathize, but we could stand to gain from being more understanding. Can we talk about the production design for a moment? The Father has one of the most frightening use of set pieces, colour, and architecture I've ever seen in a film. It’s not inherently scary (compared to say how a horror movie would use darkness, spider webs, and such), but the way the flat changes throughout the film instills just enough doubt to make you question if it's actually the way you remember it or not. The emphasis on hallways and uncertain positioning left me with only small pieces of a mental map of the space, making it difficult to even know where rooms are relative to each other. It's almost a character, actively subverting your own memory. Truly incredible. So many great moments where the director just blindsides you. My favourite was the dinner scene, it caught me off guard and watching it all play again was something else.

That ending as well was something I wasn't expecting at all. Any other year this would be 100% Hopkins Oscar to lose right? Incredible film. Hopkins DESERVES that oscar This was arguably the best performance of Hopkins’ illustrious career and that’s saying something when his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter exists. It’s such a raw and authentic performance. Hopkins captures the downward spiral of his character perfectly. The last scene is equal parts horrifying and moving. He looks so vulnerable in that scene, you feel like giving him a hug. The bit about losing his leaves would have sounded absurd coming from any other actor but man, does Hopkins sell it. Masterclass acting.

Also Olivia Colman’s performance will probably not get as much attention, but she is incredible too. She does a really good job of portraying someone who has to come to terms with the illness of a loved one. This movie fucking devastated me.

I cried hot angry tears at the end. 

This movie is also a psychological horror film unlike anything ever made before.

Absolutely unreal. It rivals The Sound Of Metal for me, for best of the last year. A masterclass in acting from Hopkins. Excellent all around. 

One scene that I found very amusing was the scene where he kept asking about the husband's watch, and if perhaps he kept the receipt. I could also see this from the husband's side, it must be incredibly frustrating to deal with a person with this condition every day. I can't think of any other film where the narrative structure is so deeply intertwined with the editing of shots, it was absolutely insane to wrap my head around. I can't even imagine what it takes to write a story like this, much less translate it into film, but it was done so masterfully. Definitely one of my favorites of the year.! The ending in which Anthony breaks down and saying he wants his mother and that he only knows that he has the watch on his wrist was just so heartbreaking. Really couldn’t stop thinking about it for the past week. Fantastic movie. 

I haven't seen discussion yet on the chronology. I know this is really quite pointless since I know the point is that we really aren't supposed to quite know what's going on, but I'm curious how people are interpreting the events. I interpret the timeline as follows:

- Anthony lives alone in his own flat, has a quarrel with a caretaker named Angela (latest in a long line), which forces Anne and James/Paul to take him in (nixing the plans for the Italian vacation)
- Anthony lives (perhaps for years) with Anne and Paul (actually probably named James), but James/Paul's behavior escalates to abuse and eventually the couple divorce and she puts him in a nursing home. During this time, he also meets the caretaker Laura,  who looks like Lucy.
- Anthony lives for years (at least 5 because she's 5 years out from a divorce) in the nursing home, with Anne visiting regularly, but then she tells him she's moving to Paris 
-At the end, Anne has been living in Paris for months with a man named Paul

My thought is most of the movie is just jumbled memory, Anthony reliving painful events and supplanting faces, names and places, when he's actually been at the nursing home the whole time. 

The only thing I can't really wrap my mind around is how he's mixing up events that haven't happened yet, like telling the doctor that Anne is moving to Paris. I think maybe in the moment he said something confusing to Anne and then in his memory he's replacing it with the Paris bit. Thoughts? It’s there with Minari and Soul as one of my favorites of 2020. It scared the absolute bejeezus out of me. Everyone is rightfully raving about how insane Hopkins is — short of maybe Elephant Man, this might be my favorite performance of his — but can we talk about the production design and how every setting is the same set dressed differently to keep us in Anthony’s headspace, completely unsure of when and where we are? I felt my stomach drop so many times trying to make sense of it and realizing that part of the game the movie is playing is that there is no making sense of it. It’s an MC Escher painting; there’s no beginning and no end and no way to orient yourself, and that’s what Anthony is going through. Anthony Hopkins was far too good in this film to lose the Oscar to Chadwick Boseman. His performance absolutely blows the competition out of the water. This is a horror film disguised as an Oscar film. Jesus christ. I didn't think you could find a kindred spirit of ""I'm Thinking Of Ending Things"" this year.

It's acted wonderfully, the editing and direction is impeccable, the way that conversations and hints seem to repeat themselves is haunting, but...good lord, you are gonna feel like shit when it's done. Now having watched this, I find Anthony Hopkins losing the Oscar, or any other award this year for that matter, to be a sick joke. It actually makes me mad. I watched this last night and at the end my wife is sobbing uncontrollably. After she composes herself as we are lying in bed and asks, “why would anyone ever watch a movie like that?!” And though there are many ways to respond to that I decided to mention all the people that no one knows about who are dealing with those suffering from dementia. Specifically the nurse at the end of the movie. There are any number of people just like her all over the world walking in to rooms with an Anthony inside - losing his grip on reality, responding sometimes violently and sometimes inconsolably. People who have been asked to take over for guilt ridden family members who finally get to a point where all their sadness is overwhelmed by their exhaustion and helplessness. It’s these people that sit next to an 80 year old crying for their mother, holding them until they forget why their crying and decide to go for a walk. I never thought about them, never had a need to think on them, and I’m grateful they are there. Anthony Hopkins was phenomenal. He's my personal choice to win Best Actor this year (and I really hope he pulls an upset). I saw this a couple weeks ago so glad to finally see a discussion for it.

Of all of the Oscar nominees I've seen so far (which is all of them except Mank at this point), I think *The Father* has stuck with me the most, even if it wasn't my out-and-out favourite. The film is just incredible; it is not often I'm moved to full-on tears by a piece of media but dammit, it happened twice here.

Much is being made of Hopkins' performance, and for good reason - it is a towering achievement. I absolutely loved Ahmed in Sound of Metal and would be chuffed to pieces if he won, but Best Lead is 100% going to either Hopkins or Boseman. I'd be happy with either, personally.

However, the structure of the film is probably the aspect which impressed me the most - it truly is like almost nothing I've ever seen before. As someone elsewhere in the thread said, *The Father* stands out because of the way in which it deals with mental illness - we're not on the outside looking in, as is usually the case, but rather right there inside Anthony's head and experiencing everything as he perceives it. It is genuinely terrifying and the use of multiple actors to portray the same characters, heightening the disorientation, is an inspired touch. I have heard this film being called a horror movie and honestly, I can't disagree.

Back to Hopkins though, my god. Understated one moment then brimming with ferocity and outrage the next, this is yet another reminder of why he is one of the all-time greats. There will be some who dismiss his performance as showy Oscar-bait, but that would be doing a massive disservice to his work here. He is the anchor of the piece, the reason the entire film works as well as it does. His vulnerability and pathos are why this is ultimately such an emotionally affecting story, and why the ending is so utterly devastating. In a lesser performer's hands *The Father* could easily have been an overwrought, overly-saccharine drama with no punch at all; as it is, it is one of the best films I will never watch again. I think this might be the best work of Hopkins' career, which is saying a lot.

I'd give him the Oscar over Chadwick personally (great performance though that was).

Chadwick will 98% win but given that the film just hit VOD and the voting deadline isn't for a few more weeks I don't think an upset is impossible. I cried like a baby at the end.  My dad is at the beginning stages of something similar and it hurts so much when he tells me something he's told me multiple times before, or when I tell him something and he doesn't remember it anymore when I bring it up.

68," The last 30 minutes were so brutally depressing Pesci sat at the airport for 3+ hours in the car just hanging out. Boss move. The whole “It is what it is” scene was fucking fantastic. The restaurant scene with Hoffa and Pro has to be one of the greatest things I've seen all year. 

Absolutely wonderful film. We already knew that Joe Pesci was an incredible actor but to come out of a 20 year retirement and give that performance is some legendary shit. Harvey Keitel is a cool mofo. ""What kind of a man makes a phone call like that...?"" One of the most affecting parts to me was at the end when De Niro was telling his nurse about how most people don’t even know who Jimmy Hoffa was anymore and it seems like he’s about to launch into some starry eyed story time and she politely but flippantly cuts him off to take his blood pressure and as soon as she’s done she walks off. “You always charge a guy with a gun - with a knife, you run away. So you charge with a gun - with a knife, you run”

Pacino’s performance was incredible! ""Your lawyer's dead""

""Who did it?""

""Cancer"" What stood out to me in the film is the way that Jimmy gets killed. We know it's coming, and we know that this will be Frank's most affecting and difficult murder. But based on just how their relationship is built and plays out through the film, I thought that it would culminate in Jimmy suddenly realizing that Frank will murder him and saying something like, ""Frank, how could you do this? I treated you like family. I loved you!"" - something that's drawn out and wrought with angst and tenderness before the act. But nope, as soon as he turns to the door, Frank just whips out his gun, fires twice in succession, and it's all over in a second. Frank murders Jimmy just like he did with the numerous other victims we saw - quick and emotionless, like it's all just part of the job (emphasizing the military parallel). It's disturbing because Jimmy truly loved and valued Frank, and Frank is agonizing over what he will have to do, and yet, the way he carries out the murder of his best friend, someone he said he will always back, is instinctive. It speaks volumes about Frank's lack of soul (or at least, it being so numb). I can't believe I'm spending my thanksgiving depressed over jimmy hoffa People in my theatre in the UK were laughing in the strangest places

I heard people laughing when Pesci struggles to eat the bread in prison and his hands were shaking. 

Thought was rather heartbreaking tbh. I loved how they introduced some of the characters with a text description, including their names and when and how they died/got killed. I think it's the essence of the movie, taking away instantly the ""coolness"" and ""glamour"" of being a gangster, seeing how almost always ends bad and how sad it is. When Frank was telling Russ that he told Jimmy he would meet him at 2, fuck man that scene gave me chills. I also liked how De Niro insisted on sitting on that backseat even though it was wet, goes to show how alert and aware he was on getting wacked. Damn the whole part with Pesci in the prison was just heartbreaking. That scene when Jo is fired and she hesitates before starting her car is one of the most tense things I've seen on film in years. He really was asking too many questions about that fish It's a small scene but the one that really got to me was when they show how Hoffa's body was cremated in secret and then it cuts to Frank who says ""it was no more complicated than that.""

I love that so much. It's just so unglamorous. Of course the answer to one of those great 20th century mysteries would be so simple and so not extraordinary. And even if that's not what actually happened to Hoffa you know the real truth is probably just as sad and mundane. It plays so well with the dour final act. Saw this a couple of weeks ago and still can’t get that Pacino/Pesci scene out of my head. With those it’s such a surprisingly tender scene of Hoffa and Russell having a heart to heart. I about cried when Jimmy Hoffa knew he was about to get whacked, but he still didn’t know it would be Frank. Just the simple utterance of:

###“Let’s get out of here, Frank.”

Broke my heart. Great movie. Small detail- Hoffa was furious after waiting 15 minutes for Tony, but he waited 40 minutes for Frank and wasn’t even that upset. He really loved and trusted him. There was a nice jolt of recognition when I realized that the actress playing Hoffa's wife was also Lois, the cranky babysitter from Goodfellas.

Its also fun going though The Irishman spotting familiar faces from The Sopranos and Boadwalk Empire in the massive cast. The entire scene for the ceremony dinner at the casino banquet will be a thing of movie legend. Pacino eating his steak staring at them with menace. Deniro pleading with Pacino to wise up. Pacino and Pesci having a scene together for the first and only time in their careers (while a concerned Deniro looks on from a distance). Pesci awarding Deniro the ring. It’s so much and it’s so fucking amazingly done and acted. So much fun watching Ray Romano and Al Pacino acting off one another. ",1,The Irishman
138," ""This isn't real enough for you, Billy? *I'm* not real enough for you?
It was real enough for Georgie!""

Low blow, Pennywise. I liked how when Georgie laughed really hard at the pop! pop! pop! popcorn impression that IT does, like REALLY laughed and wasn't afraid at all for a second, IT just totally 'went offline' and stalled and one eye wandered. Like he entertained the kid a little TOO well and created joy and love and it shut him down for a second. one thing that took me by surprise tone-wise with this movie is that Muschietti really turned it into kind of a dark fantasy adventure movie instead of a gritty horror flick. it had a certain fairytale element to it that I thought was stupid in Mama but really worked in IT. just an immensely enjoyable film, tons of fun. The way the shot centered on Pennywise's face when he was dancing in the lair was so fucking unsettling. Of all the losers, the standout in my opinion was Sophia Lillis as Bev. She really nailed the interpretation of her I had from the book, that mixture of brassy confidence and maturity for her age with her, I guess, demons - an overly handsy father and her reputation as a slut (something not in the book, and a change I liked). The scene were she joins them at the quarry and the boys just stare at her while she suntans is great. And holy fuck, her father was so incredibly creepy. The scene where he locks her in their apartment and confronts her is just...there's no Pennywise (till the end) but it's so tense. I was surprised (and impressed) how far they took that subplot from the book.

Hamilton as Bowers was really good! His whole gang was underused, and I was disappointed with their being no payoff for Vic and Belch, and with Patrick just being a more...generic bully, but the scene were Bowers kills his father, being egged on by the TV, is outstanding. 

And finally, Skarsgård. He was amazing as Pennywise. He did his own thing with the character. He really nailed my interpretation of him from the book, that despite being a malevolent being thousands of years old he's a child in many ways, and a spoiled one whose had his way with Derry for so long. Watching him break down as the Losers fight back is so cathartic. He comes off as an emotionally stunted pedophile in many ways.  I like how Pennywise grabbed the kid with the broken arm and twice pretended like he was going to bite his arm off.  Georgie's death scene was a lot more brutal than I expected. Good Lord ""I need my bifocals. They're in my second fanny pack"" 

Line of the movie That garage projector scene was some of the most intense shit I've seen in a long damn time. I jumped out of my fucking seat when Pennywise popped through the projector  The television kids show sequences. ""Come play in the sewers!"" Good god, those were creepy.  Can we take a moment to appreciate how much effort they went to in referencing the book, even when it didn't serve the story?

They had Silver. They had The Black Spot. They had the Paul Bunyan statue. They had the turtle. They had the deadlights. There were just so many small details that showed a real love and respect for the source material. Seems like they kept Mike in the story just for that gun. Holy shit that weird tracking shot of Pennywise dancing that focused on his head was super wacky. My favorite scene was the part where Ben was flipping through the pages of the history book and the librarian was just lurking creepily at the back not moving at all. I expected her to transform into Pennywise any second.  That Lois Lane line was vile. The entire theater groaned at that one. The worst thing about this movie is that it's really hard to google anything about it because of the title. I love the scene where Pennywise is just casually eating a child's arm, stops, and then uses the arm to wave at the kids. ""This town used to be a beaver trapping camp""
""It still is boys, am I right??""  Bill finally realizing after the entire movie that Georgie is dead and there is nothing that he can do about it was crushing. A surprisingly heartwarming film about how a clown helps a group of kids overcome their fears and realize the power of friendship. Great for the whole family.  The jumpcut to close ups of the New Kids on the Block poster, the acknowledgement from Ben and Bev, and then the cut back to the ominous tone was so weird, yet I absolutely loved it.
 ""You'll float too. You'll float too. YOU'LL FLOAT TOO"" as Georgie's voice changes and his face decays. Nightmare fuel!  I loved the part when Henry insults Bev and Ben just screams at him like a maniac. Did not expect Georgie's fuckin arm coming off wtf New Kids On The Block poster scene >>> ",0,It
57," If the guy wasn’t good looking, this would be the most disgusting piece of trash ever. Imagine if a fat slob mafia dude was cast as Massimo. Genuinely the worst erotic film I have ever seen in my life. The dialogue is laughable and the soundtrack is unbelievably annoying. The director also fucks around with the camera way too much with endless pans.

This film makes 50 Shades of Grey look like The Handmaiden and I am glad Roger Ebert never lived to see this film. I never thought I would see a day where a movie made 50 Shades of Grey look good, but 365 happened.

This is hands down the worst movie I have seen this year and will probably stay that way.

The fact that this movie is making abuse, asssult, and Stockholm Syndrome look hot is fucking disgusting. That yacht scene was 😰
Terrible film and I cringe for my friend who ended up watching it with her MOTHER! the thing that annoys me the most about all the thinkpieces being written about this is how they describe the film as completely devoid of value except as masturbatory material.

i would actually go further and argue the film isn't even worth watching in that regard. people are probably gonna check out this movie thinking it's shitty but super sexy, and end up wasting their time when they realize it's about as arousing as watching grass grow.

aside from the sex scene on the yacht filmed with the drones, which is only notable due to the camera angles and how overlong the scene itself is, the sex scenes are nothing you haven't seen before in a Cinemax (Skinemax) show that airs after 11:30 PM. i actually found most of the passionate scenes extremely offputting given the film's propensity to frame the male and female lead as sexy bantering rivals rather than, you know, a kidnapper and his fucking kidnapping victim. I actually didn't expect anything to beat ""The Grudge"" as the worst film of 2020 but wow... this movie in a word... despicable.

99 out of 100 times, I don't have trouble with the subject matter of a film but with ""365 Days"" there were multiple times here I audibly questioned what I was seeing on screen. It's horrible! This girl gets kidnapped and sexually assaulted for an hour and then the rest of the film she pretty much has Stockholm Syndrome. 

The only saving graces from this film are the very few clever lines, the bad english, and honest to god, THE SOUNDTRACK! The soundtrack is ""The Room"" level bad and it makes every scene hilarious! I’m pleasantly surprised to see how few comments this thread has. It means most people’s time hasn’t been wasted in this utter steaming pile of shit. If it wasn't for Netflix, then this movie would have faded into obscurity as a *Fifty Shades* wannabe from Poland.

Netflix is to entertainment what Facebook is to information. On a scale from 50 Shades to After, it’s straight-up softcore porn. Unpopular opinion: It was STILL a way better movie than any of the 50shades. I think the chemistry between the two is what makes it work. The dialogue needs work for sure and if they continue, they need to stray away from the book ending. It's Anna-Maria and Michele that make the chemistry so fire that people enjoy it. I won't deny they didn't do a good job of setting up the plot in the script. It was all over the place, hopefully now that netlflix is involved it gets cleaned up. (Cleaned up meaning a more organized script....lets keep the steam LOL) I highly doubt anything is going to top this film for worst movie of 2020, and that includes Artemis Fowl and The Grudge! Of cours I’m old enough to know that not all movies should be about healthy relationships and two cutie pies falling in love. And I actually love a good erotic movie (Fatal attraction? Basic Instinct? Wide closed eyes?) and would like to watch a soft porn with a good storyline. But god this movie is awful just awful story is ridiculous the acting sucks (lucky for them and the audience that the leading actors are very hot) sex scene are very hard to watch and yes it’s rape and sexual assaults and the girl is making sexy faces when she suppose to be horrified. The leading man is telling the girl in a sexy romance voice that he will not force himself into her while he is actually kidnapped her and caging her for a year!!!! this movie was described for me by a friend saying “it’s literally 50 shades of grey without the cringe” but I would say this movie is even cringer It's to appeal the people who like 50 Shades. It's trashy, but there's audience for that, specially frustrated women who are too prude to watch porn or explore their sexualities and dream to marry an abusive bad boy billionaire. It's ficiton after all, some of the elements are closer modern fairy tale, but then we remember that real life billionaires aren't the nice guys and the prince charming in the movie is an assassin from mafia. 

**The good**: the actors were good looking and had chemistry. Also the luxury setting and sexy scenes are good to look at, the movie make itself from the visuals only. 

**The bad**: everything else. It glorified rape, sexism, the female protagonist was vapid, the male protagonist was a criminal, the narrative structure is messy and confusing.  

It did the soft porn better than 50 shades, since Dakota and Jamie had zero chemistry. But the plot managed to be even a bit worse. I gave 3/10 only because of the scenarios and the sex scenes looked realistic. I just came here hoping someone would shed some light on whether these sex scenes are real.  I tend to agree with all the criticisms but was intrigued by the occasional cock shaft.  Ftr, I’ve seen news articles from the actors saying they weren’t real but I don’t buy it necessarily. this was trending in so many countries. like there's just seriously no fate left in humanity. Very disappointed with this film.  The lead actors have more chemistry than the 50 shades actors but the dialogue makes me cringe.  How can Massimo judge a man for child trafficking but he himself is guilty of kidnapping?  My favourite erotic film will still remain 9 1/2 weeks.  Mickey Rourke was the bomb! To be honest, Michele is the only reason I 've watched 365 days. 365 dayıs [removed] Lol someone wrote on Letterboxd that if the guy was ugly then this would be a horror film. Then someone else (obv jokingly said), “I tried to follow his footsteps and now I got court next week”. Lmao. Well yeah, that *is* why it’s so popular. Gratuitous male nudity is something that isn’t seen very often in mainstream movies, and this movie has a LOT of gratuitous male nudity. This movie finds every excuse to get this man shirtless/nude as often as possible while the main actress is relatively clothed. 

It’s the only thing that this movie gets right, because *nothing else makes sense*. [deleted] > the soundtrack is unbelievably annoying.

I found that the soundtrack made it better. It reminded me of how bad ""The Room"" soundtrack was So it's basically most Hermione/Draco fanfiction but put in movie form? I can’t imagine a worse movie to watch with your mother ",0,365 Days
6," I'm not gonna touch on the story/world having the depth of a puddle or the paper-thin characters. But what even was the point of finding Sisu? She didn't do anything, just tagged along with Raya. She got new powers with each gem piece....and then she died and never used them to fight the monsters. Everything is solved by the humans putting the gem back together themselves. 

You can literally remove Sisu from the story and it doesn't change. Call it ""Raya's Journey"" or whatever. Raya travelling alone to collect the gem pieces. I mean she already knew where they were, she didn't even need Sisu to help her locate them.

Also I couldn't understand a single thing the big lunky dude was saying he was so mumbly and growly. Story would've worked better as a tv show. Events rush through and there's no build up to most of the emotional climaxes. 

Namaari clearly had an arc similar to Zuko from Avatar but it's so rushed it doesn't hit at all. The rest of the cast seems underexplored.

Also so much lore and setting that could be explored.

Beautiful movie though. I feel like this movie would have been WAY better of Raya and Naamari had switched roles in the story. If we followed the daughter of Fang who betrayed Heart for the good of her clan, and in doing so broke the world.  She then goes on the quest to find Shishu and save the world. She gets to spend the movie making up for her mistake in a world that doesn't trust her.

The film's message about earning trust by giving it becomes a lot stronger if it's Naamari who sets aside her fear and her need to ""do what's right for my people"" and leaves the stone in Raya's hands. Are you kidding me? Hey kids, you know that person who keeps fucking you over? Yeah give em another shot. Like I 100% get the message as they lay into it pretty thick, but damn how many chances do people get? Y’all I can’t emphasize enough how the “trust” theme irked the living hell out of me. It’s one of those themes that is so overwhelmingly superficial, that it’s actually toxic in practice. And it bugs the bejesus out of me that kids could definitely take the message the wrong way.

No, you do not have to trust people who abuse you. Trust is EARNED, Disney, it’s not freely given. If someone repeatedly hurts you, you are not obligated to trust them “because it’s the right thing to do.” It made me super uncomfortable because that borders on some gaslighting, abusive nonsense. Maybe it’s just because of my life experience (work in law enforcement, survivor myself), but I seriously cringed at that because adults who prey on kids often use that sort of reasoning when grooming victims. It seriously bothered me to see it solidified in a Disney movie. 

Parents, please talk to your kids about what *healthy* trust looks like. Your kids are not obligated to trust someone who hurts them just because it’s “right” or because they want to fix something that’s broken. That’s not trust, that’s the start of toxic codependency and abuse. Overall a really beautiful looking movie and pretty decent. This movie had a lot of potential so i do feel a bit disappointed. IMO doesn't come near frozen or tangled in terms of overall story quality. I also enjoyed Moana is quite a bit more. 

**What I liked about the movie:**

obviously the animation. it was incredible. 

The dragon. Both awwqafina performance and the design grew on me. Didn't think at like any of it based on trailers but it worked.

The side characters. Another thing i thought Id hate based on the trailer. I actually really liked the side characters and wish they got more fleshed out. Except for the baby. not a fan of the whole 'baby that can move and think like an adult' but it also wasn't as annoying as I'd thought. 

Raya. Loved everything about raya. 

The fighting scenes. wish there were more of it. 

**My issues with the movie:**

tl;dr: Bad writing. fast pacing. poor dialogue. too cheezy and the writers forcing themselves into dumb plot. 

Everything about the beginning. It was soo cheesy, way more than usual. I cringed more than once and i typically don't cringe like that during disney animated movies. Also, I know that it pretty typical of disney to rush through the intrs so we can get to the main story quicker, but this one felt way too forced. Everything happened so quickly and there were too many plot holes for me to ignore. a couple small plot holes are easy to ignore but when there are too many it really takes you out of the movie. Everything to do with the crystal made no sense. If this thing is so important why does it have almost no security. Also its got to be in the most obvious place. How did none of the other tribes realize it was in the big ancient mystical looking building on the top of the mountain? And it has no roof. Not like it mattered since it security was non existent, but anyone could have just done what the chief did and come flying in through the roof. 

Next the scene where rayas father turns to stone. There is no reason he couldn't have gone into the river with her. He sits there talking to her for 2 minutes before yeeting her into the river. He could have easily (and it would have been safer for raya) if he held her and jumped into the river with her. I dont understand why he just accepted he needed to turn into stone there except for the fact that the movie needed it to move the plot forward. Also why the fuck didnt all those people on the bridge just jump into the river??  

Also, I think the movie could have had more exposition about the dragons and the evil cloud things at the start. 


My biggest issue though is probably the pacing of the movie and all the missed potential. Disney created and amazing world here, but we barely got to see any of it. Going to the 5 lands and collecting the crystals should have been an amazing adventure full of world building. But it seriously felt like we got 5 minutes in each land and collecting the crystals was sooo easy. If these crystal parts are so important how has nobody attempted to steal them before raya? would have been incredibly easy for fang to take all of them. This movie would have really worked better as a mini series or even just 30min longer. This story was too big and amazing to be 145min movie and it suffered for it.

 The side characters where surprisingly good. Flesh them out for christ sake. 2min of backstory is not fleshed out and i will not care for them. add 10+ of character development with worldbuilding and the movie improves. 

My next big issue is fang and namaari at the end. Fang just betrays and backstabs throughout the whole movie but at the end it all somehow ok ? they never made a real attempt to show that they had changed. Even at the end its no namaari that takes the leap of faith, it ray. namaari should have been the first one to turn herself into stone. The moral of the story? backstab everyone and somehow everything will work out for you. 

The scene where Sisu dies is so incredibly frustrating. Again i think this was really bad writing. Its so obvious they didn't want to have any real villain in this movie except for the evil spooky clouds, but the film really suffered so much for it. Its so dumb that the dragon fan girl points her crossbow at a fucking dragon. How does she not realize ""hmm the dragon I've idolized and looked up to my entire life is working with my enemy and they say they want to fix the world.. am i the bad guy here? should i listen to them ? should i not point my fucking crossbow and the fucking dragon and think about pulling the trigger ??"". Susis death was 90% on namaari and 10% on raya. You cant blame raya after the constant betrayals from fang and namaari. She brought the weapon so her plan from the start was to betray them and shoot somebody if she needed to. 

Just quick thought of how they could fix it: Raya and namaari meet and then namaari gives the crystal and Susi comes out. all the same up to this point. But then namaaris mother comes out because she was following namaari (after that super obvious firework signal) and takes all the dragon crystals. Namaari didnt know about this and feels betrayed by her mother. Namaari then saves raya and they work together to help Susi. In the end the mother realizes she made a mistake and sacrifices herself to save everyone.

 Then the writers would have to think of a reason why fang putting the crystals together and having Susi doesnt fix anything. Because according to the movie it should, but then the movie plot would fall apart (again bad writing). I know this is also cheezy but its not as bad as what they gave us.

also the WATER dragons not being able to defeat the evil clouds that are weak to WATER makes no sense. make some fog. make it rain. there's no reason the dragons died except that the plot required it. 

This is way longer then I thought it'd be. I doubt anyone will read all of it but it was nice to vent about it. Still a decent movie thats worth watching for the visuals. “Sisus death was just as much your fault as it was mine.” 

Umm what the fuck no it wasn’t. The girl brought a fucking crossbow to a peaceful meeting with the purpose of stealing the dragon to take the glory for herself. Fuck off with that shit The girl from fang pissed me off so much! What does binturi mean? “Sisus death was just as much your fault as it was mine.”

How?  She was the one who brought a crossbow to what was supposed to be a meeting of making amends. Gorgeously animated, every frame looked so beautiful and the water effects in this movie are                                                                   some of the best ever in a cgi movie. I wish I could see it in theaters and not just on demand Me: yeah I can see where this is going 

*Sisu fucking dies* 

Me: ...oh

Great movie. Just finished watching it. What really lingers with me is that I don't think the animation has ever been this good in a Disney movie, the colors and art design is just out of this world! Whether you like it or not no one can deny that this movie looked gorgeous. No one pointing out that the ending was a play by play of Guardians of the Galaxy? I really enjoyed the movie though might’ve worked better as a Disney+ limited series so that we could have spent more time in each kingdom. What we got though was pretty great, I especially love the idea that the dragons fly by running on rain. It makes for such a great visual I genuinely don’t know where 3D animation goes from here. I guess we’ve been saying that every year since Toy Story, but the lighting and textures are fucking insane. Regardless of the rest of the movie’s quality, the animation was perfect. Of course Alan Tudyk voiced Tuk Tuk. hahahaha Traveling on the river represents the Mekong River.  

People in Lao/Thailand call the Mekong River, Mae Nom Kong.  This means mother of waters. You could see how many different countries/cultures rely on the River for survival.  This is a theme in Raya. Am I the only one confused about how Raya is riding on Tuk Tuk?

Tuk Tuk is rolling on the ground, but the saddle isn't rolling with Tuk Tuk. Does Tuk Tuk have a hole bored through them that the saddle has an axel attached to? Is it just positioned perfectly so that the saddle is attached to Tuk Tuk at the perfect center of rotation?

I AM SO CONFUSED. The baby was not as annoying as I thought it would be. Maybe one thing that irked me is when the 5 main dragons are fighting against the dunes(or whatever they were called). Main dragons magic is rain, the dunes hate water! so why didnt he just... man idk [deleted] Man, I loved everything about this movie except the dialogue. I feel like a lot of lines were so rooted in modern day that it won't age so well. If this flick carried itself like Mulan or Hercules (still funny, but has a great sense of time and place), I think it'd be an instant classic. I almost feel it would have been better as a 7-10 episode mega-series.  This may be Disney's largest story yet and 2 hours just felt like they couldn't explore their world that much.  

Overall it was gorgeous and I did like the premise alot.  Not the best Disney movie but absolutely not bad at all.  Just felt like I wanted more of the world at the end and more time to develop the nations and side characters.  Mostly because Captain Boun is a legend. I personally did not liked the Moral of the Story. There are people in the world who should never be trusted, telling kids that they should trust them for the good is pretty dumb lesson ",0,Raya and the Last Dragon
126," Very thought-provoking movie. The conclusion left me feeling so sorry for Eddy's father. At first, it seemed like the story was suggesting that the unethical aspect of what happened was that the families weren't told about the true nature of the study and were unfairly deprived of each other. And while those parts were horrible, I think the worst part was that three men and their families had to endure the indignity of being treated like a subject in a parenting experiment. Like many parents, Eddy's father had to cope with the suicide of his child. But unlike other parents, he also had to face the scrutiny of being compared to the fathers of the other two 'identical' men, as if the suicide had to be directly attributed to his parenting style. I thought that was horribly unfair. No one becomes a parent expecting to be have their parenting style judged as if in a controlled experiment... even the 'best' of parents can't stand up 100% to that type of scrutiny or avoid all tragedy. Just got back from seeing it too so I need a little time to unpack everything but it was a very well done documentary. There was a bunch of holy shit moments 

EDIT: in regards to the research assistant. She seemed really funny and interested YET she seemed to have little to no empathy for the studies being done to these children and it kind of puts her in a bad light.  I agree that there wasn't enough on the older adopted sisters. Can you imagine finding or orchestrating families with different incomes, all having an older adopted sister of the same age, and all from the same agency?

What about the murder? How can they just glaze over that and not really explain it?

I was curious about their ""troubled childhoods"" and psychiatric help. And about Eddie's behavior before he met the brothers. What was he like? Would that help explain the suicide? At the end one of the brothers seemed to subtly blame Eddie's dad's strict parenting style. That seemed unfair to me but I don't know any other information.

Also I'm wondering if the study was picking birth parents with mental health issues or if the two twin sets is just a coincidence. Of course that's something that we could learn from finding the other twins. But it makes more sense to me that the purpose of the study was to look at children of parents with mental health issues than studying parental practices. The parental practices idea only came from that one guy who left the study so maybe he didn't know a lot.

I was curious if any lawsuit was pursued. Was any law broken by the agency not letting the parents know all the conditions of the study? 

Has anyone been able to find any other information outside of the documentary? I could only find a couple wiki pages but they didn't say much.  The champagne popping part was the oh shit for me. Of course at the time it just seems odd, what did these people just get away with? Now knowing everything we know now.... it gets really dark for me. I used to be a conspiracy theorist and hate that this movie rustled long dormant parts of my brain awake. HOW DEEP DOES THIS GO???? WHERE ARE THE DOCUMENTS??? Kidding kinda. All in all a heartbreaking movie that i was hooked to the entire time. 9/10 1.  I don't know what to make of it.  He was unethical in the extreme, whether it had to do with what he experienced or not.
2. I think that's part of the power of the film.  How could this have happened?  Why is it still being suppressed?  Who's behind all this?
3. No, I thought she was a fucking sociopath, with her attempts to justify what was done to these boys and who knows how many others.  At least the other research assistant allowed that he ""might"" have been ethically compromised.
4. The boys' smiles.  Truly capable of lighting up the darkest of rooms.
5. ""Oh shit,"" and ""You're fucking kidding me,"" and ""No fucking way,"" and ""Oh. My. Fucking.  God.""   Not since ""Brokeback Mountain"" has a film gotten so under my skin.  And this was a documentary!
6. Well, this was all before DNA testing, and DNA testing is dependent on who participates.  So the impact could have been profound, or it could have been negligible, or it could have been moot.  In temporal context, it was moot.  
 Thanks for the questions, though.  I saw the movie alone, and I don't know anyone who's seen it, and I'm DYING to discuss it! Ok, I was waiting to hear from any adoptees, as I am. Given to an agency, went to a foster family for 6 weeks, then adopted with my ""forever family"". 

This research was disgusting on so many levels. I was appalled, shocked, dismayed, distraught.... Think of this from the adult adopted child viewpoint. We had no say in the matter, none. 

Children were commoditites. This film got me thinking. Was the OB/GYN doc/ hospital involved in referring pregnant Moms to this agency. Was the mental health practitioner given something for referring his /her pregnant Jewish patient to this ""researcher"" . Why didn't we get to find out what the agency was toasting. You guessed that the parent overheard. 

Finally, they searched for the birthmother and found her. What about birthdad? What about the 4 sets of twins that weren't notified. I hope a class action lawsuit comes out of this.  [deleted] I’m late to the party, just saw it. 
I just don’t think scientists thought as much about ethics at the time (think about the Stanford Prison Experiment).  We still want to understand nature vs nurture. 

5. Most of my “oh shit” moments came late in the film: the siblings and parents were part of the research design, the report won’t be unsealed until 2066, there was no consideration or warning of biological mental illness.  I see there was an AMA with the director a couple of days ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/91i3o6/im\_tim\_wardle\_director\_of\_the\_documentary\_three/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/91i3o6/im_tim_wardle_director_of_the_documentary_three/)

Some quick recaps, reading it:

\- they couldn't film the rest of the family (say the adopted sisters), since the crew was based in the UK, and they had restraints with their budget and scope.

\- the journalist in the film has a theory that the results could have undermined some basic teachings of Freud, and that is part of why Neubauer tried to bury it.

\- ""We also heard from another twin pair adopted from Louise Wise Services who approached the JBFCS and asked if they were part of the experiment and were told 'no'. They later spoke with Lawrence Perlman (the psychologist in the film) who had notes on them from when he came to study them in their homes when they were children(!) So I don't have all that much faith in the JBFCS when they say they are now going to do the right thing.""

\- ""I was trying to leave the nature/nurture question open to discussion - obviously it's some combination of the two. The ending is trying to say that nurture is much more significant than some of the earlier material in the film would suggest.""

\- ""Jewish people I've talked to at screenings and they are pretty shocked and angry about the story. My wife is Jewish and she finds watching it pretty tough.""

\- ""One of the most frustrating things for many of those involved (including the triplets) is that no findings were ever published - all this damage was done to people's lives, and no knowledge has come of it. In this way it reminds me of the Project Nim study"" Fantastic movie!  But I left wanting to know much more about what became of Robert and David. What are they doing for a living now?  What kinds of families do they have?  What prompted Robert to leave the Triplets restaurant? What kind of relationship do Robert and David have with each other now? Just came home from seeing this. Such a great documentary. I loved how the director was able to craft a tight 90 minute film with no narrator. It was all participants and news clips without a ""voice of god"" to come in to advance the story. Brilliant filmmaking telling an incredible story.

My responses:

1. The Nazi tests were about direct torture. In contrast, this was about observing orphans being adopted by loving families. Not saying it was ethical, but to a psychiatrist in the early 60s, I can see it being a benign way to finally figure out nature v. nurture. I bet a Nazi comparison wouldn't have even crossed his mind.
2. I think the movie concluded fairly resolutely that nurture is more important than nature. The similarities the brothers had were superficial. One of the relatives stated that our genes might try to sway our direction, but in the end, the way we are raised is more important.
3. I liked both research assistants. At least they had the courage to speak in front of a camera. Acknowledge that it wasn't ethical now, but it was also the 60s, things change and it was all considered good science then. It doesn't show them in their best light, but I salute them talking when obviously no else would.
4. Hard to pick one favorite scene. Maybe the father getting teary eyed talking about his son's suicide. Up to that point he was presented as kind of a villain. In the end, you realize we are all human. We try our best, but we also fuck up and live with regrets.
5. I was thinking ""oh shit"" pretty much every 10 minutes.
6. I'm sure since the film came out, more people have found a lost twin they had no idea existed. As [GEng7](https://www.reddit.com/user/GEng7) said, if I was adopted through the Louise Wise Agency and filmed as a kid, alarm bells should be going off. I have to say I wasn’t a huge fan of this movie. I felt like it would have been better off as a multi-part podcast where they could fully go into the different storylines such as the murder and the sisters in each of the triplet’s adopted family. The movie also felt rather slanted and while I agree with the side it took, it would have been good to hear a little more from the other side and justifications for the experiments. A few thoughts on this extremely compelling movie.  Can't get it out of my head.

1.  I suspect that the psychologist rationalized the study something like ""they'll never know what they are missing (by not growing up with their twins/siblings), and we'll gain insight into \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (whatever they were studying).""  Obviously morally wrong to most people, but consistent with his (the psychologist's) own self-interest.   This flaw in human nature is understudied and ripe for development.  
2. If I were jewish, adopted, and grew up within 150 miles of NYC, I'd be thinking about whether people came to my house and filmed/tested me on a periodic basis.
3. My take on the nature/nurture question is that the nature part (all were wrestlers, smoked, had great smiles, etc.) was somewhat generic, maybe on the superficial side.   Listening to their wives and why they liked one or the other, listening to the triplets themselves, listening to the discussions about why Eddy committed suicide, reveals that they were clearly different personalities.  That's only one dimension of each one's uniqueness.  One other key aspect is the nurturing aspect of love.  We don't have enough data to say too much conclusively, but I came away with a stronger conviction than ever that it's critical to love your people with all your heart.   That doesn't mean discipline should or shouldn't be part of the equation.
4. Even identical twins and triplets brought up by the same parents have different personalities, different ways of addressing challenges in their lives, and different ways of expressing and receiving love.   So it's hard to believe the motivation behind the study was nature/parenting related nurture alone because even when circumstances are such that the children should develop close to identically if it's possible at all, they don't.   
5. Perhaps the reason why we haven't seen a study report is that it takes a lifetime (and maybe more!) to understand the full ramifications of the different upbringings.   At one point the psychologist probably became too old to continue, the study participants became to old and self aware to participate in these tests and observations without being brought in to what was going on.  And of course when the triplets found each other, it would have disturbed any findings from then on anyway.   
6. One other consideration is that the study organizers may at one point have become aware of their own potential liability and decided to fade away quietly. To answer question 3, the research assistant is Natasha Josefowitz. I had never heard of her, but she is interesting. She is 91 and continues to lead an engaged life (I mean, how many 90 year olds have their own personal website?). But, eh, I don't even want to touch upon how complicit she might have been in the brothers' mistreatment. I mean, she was new in the field, it wasn't her study, it seemed like a good idea at the time, etc. Ok, I guess I just ""touched upon it"". Still, a very interesting life, and a good addition to the film:

https://theoutline.com/post/5551/three-identical-strangers-twins-parent-trap

""Towards the end of Three Identical Strangers, the boys’ aunt says something striking: 'Coming from the Holocaust, our family has a knowledge that when you play with humans, you do something very wrong.'"" Saw it yesterday.  I thought it was great.  I really like how the film just laid everything out there and left the viewer to draw their own conclusions.  I thought it was interesting that the excuse the research assistant used about it ""being a different time"" for why they thought it was ok to separate the children.  Jesus - it was ok to screw with people's lives with a secret research experiment in the united states only 50 years ago?  That doesn't hold water.  These people - especially Neubaur - were messed up.  I would still like to know what they were trying to learn.  When they revealed that first placing a single adoptee into the families a few years prior to the separated twins being placed there was a part of the experiement it showed  how mind-numbingly manipulative of everyone involved they were.  These were professionals that were supposed to observe human subject protocols.  Damn, the more I think about it, the angrier I get.  How can anything else this ""world renowned"" scientist did in his life be worth anything after the ethical lapses exposed in this film? What I don't understand is, why did one triplet go to a college as a freshman where his brother had already been there a year as a freshman.  They're the exact same age.   Did the parents hold Eddie back a year?  Did he take a year off.  That wasn't really covered. Just saw this today and it has stuck with me the rest of the evening. What a great film/story.  

1.  I have to think he thought it was a totally justifiable experiment but I too found the nazi similarity interesting. He had clearly different motives for his research, but ultimately didn't hesitate to experiment on humans too. IMO the experiment is heinous, but I think the idea might have merit. What if you could conclusively determine how to be a better parent and how to provide the nurture that seems so important.  But that is moot if you dont complete or publish your research. I found that the hardest to digest. He already did the awful part, why not publish?

2.  I felt like it's too hard to say definitively that nurture wins over nature, but I think the be as t conclusion I would draw is nurture is a vital part. I think there are SO MANY questions left unanswered, but the most important one is who was involved that still doesn't know they were?

3.  I thought I was going to, but ultimately no. I get the idea that we can't fully judge decisions made in the past with our morals or ideals of the present, BUT even in present day she seemed to not really care about the negative of their research. 

4.  That's a hard question. I enjoyed the film immensely, but I guess my favorite part is when you find out they're going to get access to the research. 

5.  I did, a lot.  

6.  I guess it depends on if your potential twin also did DNA testing.   I hope people realize that this is a grain of salt on the tip of the iceberg when it comes to human experiments in our current society.  Having bipolar disorder and coming from an unstable environment I often wonder if my disorder would have ever come to the full fruition that it has if I had a more stable and less abusive environment.  So during the film my thoughts varied as each layer of the story unfolded.  When they introduced the female twins and pointed out the similarities for both groups I felt comforted - in that I was always going to be this way and I have no control over it and it's okay. Then they went on to focus on Eddy and the differences between the triplets and I went back to thinking ""well, maybe I would have a different outcome if so and so hadn't happened during my early development and adolescent"".   It reminded me a lot of ACES if anyone has ever studied or applied that to the work they do (I work with youth). 

I wonder if Louis Wise Services ever expected anyone would find each other naturally.  I'm just going to put this out there...  This film is constructed so tightly that there doesn't seem to be a single unnecessary scene.  So why do they spend time showing the Research Assistant's photos with all these powerful politicians?  More to the point, how has this one random woman been able to meet all of these powerful people?

So what is the director of this very tightly-constructed story trying to tell us through that digression? Didn’t like the research assistant. She seemed to happy to have met all those crazy liberal people. What they did was fucked but I don’t think it had anything to do with Eddy’s death. In general I feel the stuff in that research is probably worthless except for the identities of those twins involved. Otherwise I doubt they gained any masterful knowledge from watching toddlers draw pictures. I think Eddy’s death was a result of them getting famous and him not being able to handle it.  So well done and interesting!!!! I was shocked many times in the film, I hope this gets traction for awards!  It's interesting how when I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was a fun, crazy story of three triplets separated by birth who found each other later in life. I figured this meant that they were adopted by different families who were never told about being triplets, but what didn't occur to me is that this would be inhumane. I'm sure I'm not totally alone here. 

I feel like after watching this documentary, it's pretty clear that separating them had a huge negative effect on them, but like the woman involved in the experiment's said, I would have never thought that it would be a really bad thing to do. However, I don't know much about psychology in that area. It is a really interesting study and I see why they would want to do this experiment, I just wish it could have been performed in a more humane way. Anyone else have thoughts on this? Which kid was responsible for the murder? Was it Eddy? because that would help explain the suicide. Unless they're a sociopath I'm sure they feel deep regret over that as an adult. Otherwise decent people can do fucked up shit as a kid, especially when they're consumed in a world of peer pressure, and drugs. 


Not saying any murderer deserves forgiveness or empathy, but I'm sure there are plenty of adults out there that got peer pressured towards being involved in something fucked up as a kid and it haunts them to this day.

Both the assistants gave me a very bad vibe, also I hate to say it but Eddy's father. I mean obviously he's a very old man, but he just seemed to lack emotion. He said he'd wish he had taught Eddie more things, but one of the conclusions of the story was how important growing up in a nurturing environment is. The most important lesson in life is to love yourself first, and when you grow up around strict parents that are never satisfied and show little emotion that can make that difficult.

39," Love how this avoided so many obvious subplots and tropes - Ruben never has a relapse, he doesn't have a romance with his hot ASL teacher, his RV doesn't get robbed etc The sound mixing/editing deserves SO much attention this upcoming Oscar season holy shit. The shot of Ruben drumming on the metal slide while the little boy put his ear to it was fucking beautiful. I’m tearing up thinking about it. THAT LAST SCENE. That ending was so well done.  They didn’t harp on the break-up or basically that his life is now in shambles and he is homeless, yet it had such an impact in those final moments.  He got the implants to get back to his old life, thus destroying his new life, only to find his old life has moved on without him, and is left with essentially little to nothing. One thing I love about this movie is the lack of extreme plot twist. I’ve become so accustomed to thinking, “alright what shit is gonna happen next...” and it turns out? Nothing. And I really loved that. The center wasn’t fishy or suspicious, Lou never do anything out of line, and Ruben although stressed never had a crazy tantrum destroying anything outside of the trailer scene. 

The Sound of Metal is a great title as well. I just realized the title refers to both the music Ruben played and the sound his new implants gave him. The scene where Ruben returns after the implants and Joe has to tell him he can't stay was amazingly well done. The disappointment Joe feels, Ruben not really getting it... Just great acting. Just when you’re blown away by these performances, remember that both Cooke and Ahmed are British! Incredible accent work. Beautiful film. I don’t have so much an analysis but just wanted to share personally how much this movie struck a chord with me.

I played in a touring band and am into the same bands as Ruben (if his shirts are any indication) so that’s what initially compelled me to give it a watch, but was not at all expecting how much I would identify with his story.

I am an addict who was in a long term relationship with a non-addict. I had an intervention via a relative and was essentially forced into rehab despite my wishes. My partner promised she would wait. That scene of Lou and Ruben standing at the cab broke me- because essentially same conversation happened to me.

After arriving at the rehab, fighting it, a couple of months go by and I eventually began to find my place & form deep bonds with the people in my facility. I was offered a job there to work with others dealing with their addiction. 

However, my primary goal was to get back into my relationship, get back to my band. “Save my life”

So against the advice of everyone in my program, I left. 

I returned and tried to revive my relationship, since I was now “fixed” . But we were on two totally separate life trajectories at that point. That open arm embrace upon my return that I had been fantasizing about was instead stifled, awkward. We just didn’t jive anymore. Our breakup looked the same too, through tears and solemn acceptance.

My sobriety ultimately failed- and I can’t help but wonder if it’s in part because I prioritized the wrong things at the time.

So yeah, wonderful movie. Makes me really love and appreciate the power of film. Feels weird getting so personal on this sub, but if you read this, thanks. The scene where Joe is telling Ruben he can’t stay with the group anymore; specifically when Ruben is anxiously explaining why he needs money, and Joe tells him he is acting like an addict was incredibly well done by both actors. The mix of disappointment/sadness but softness from Paul Raci, and the frustration and inner turmoil from Riz is done perfectly. A scene that will stick with me for a while. Is that really what it sounds like for people with implants? I naively assumed it would be like audio feed of normal sound. Not the crackling static. Genuinely laughed out loud when Ruben was drawing the naked lady for Jenn.  


""I don't like it completely shaved, I like a little hair on it.""  


\*fist bump\*  


Amazing film, very powerful! Brilliant movie. Amazing performance. A lot of people think Oldman will win his second this year but I'm really rooting for Ahmed to win his first. Anyone else notice how when Ruben starts working on the roof and Joe says not to, it’s because “it doesn’t need fixing” just like his deafness doesn’t need fixing? Thought it was a cool little detail Just watched it. My cousin's wife, who recommended it,  has cochlear implants.  She can't really understand music thru the implants, either.

I don't think this movie is really about just deafness specifically.  It's about loss.  Ruben spends the whole movie trying to get his old life back. The airstream, the gig life, the metal, the girl.  And he can't, because none of it is the same after. He rejected the deaf commune because it required him to cut ties with the hearing world, and everyone in it. He wants his old life back, that's the goal.

In the end, he has that moment of acceptance. Of course he's not throwing away the implant forever, he's just cutting off the sounds when it gets overwhelming. He gets his moment of stillness, when he accepts that everything has changed and he can finally move forward. He has nothing, but he's finally free. [deleted] The scene where Ruben is listening to Lou and her dad's song and the sound fades into what he's actually hearing... Amazing. This is one of those movies that really scares me and it's heartbreaking. 

It really was a rollercoaster of emotions. 

I found it funny that Matthew Amalric is in this movie when he had another which evoked similar feelings, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Movies were the main character goes through a medical ordeal in this way always unsettle me.

It definitely is Top 5 for me this year. Am I the only one who kept on lowering their volume as the movie progressed? Lost of hearing is one of the most frightening that could happen to someone. I guess people choose to view this film differently. There are some that choose to interpret the moments more reassuringly as acceptance. I thought the ending was incredibly sad. Absolute silence being better than the ringing noise that he spent 40-60 grand on is an incredibly sad position to be in, and the film made me realize how devastating it would be to never be able to hear for the rest of your life. Man... I cried for 10 minutes after that last scene cut to black. One of the most beautiful and powerful closing shots I’ve experienced in a long time. This film was truly an astounding accomplishment. Cinema at its absolute purest. Loved it. Movies about drummers seem to stick... Whiplash and now Sound of Metal. This movie broke me down. The break up/acceptance scene at the end finally did me in. Beautiful film. And Riz Ahmed deserves an Oscar nomination. Easily best movie of the year. It better win best sound editing and mixing at the Oscars this year. Can't think of better use of sound in a movie. ",1,Sound of Metal
132," Man. The whole movie is great, but that scene where Lady Bird finally confronts Danny about being gay and instead he just breaks down crying and she comforts him was the moment I fell in love with it. Such a 180 of where I thought that scene would go.  ""Are you and mom going to get a divorce?""

""No. We can't afford to.""

I don't know why but i thought it was the funniest joke in the whole movie. ""Some people aren't built happy."" Floored me. Half way through the movie the older couple sitting next to me had this exchange.

Man: ""I don't know what this film is about""
Woman: ""yes i agree, i'm sorry honey this was a bad choice""

At the end of the film they were both sobbing.  timothee's character Kyle had my audience in stitches with every word he said. one of my favourites of the year!  The first act kinda felt like Wes Anderson doing ""Napoleon Dynamite"", I loved it  I love that we are now getting at a point where we can have early 2000s period pieces. This movie perfectly encapsulated that time in so many scenes throughout the movie, doing it hilariously so every time.

My favorite example of it was the use of ""Crash Into Me"". It reminded me a lot of the use of ""Drops of Jupiter"" in the movie Other People. Taking a song that we've heard before and using it in a stereotypical way at first and then using it later on in the film to help get to the emotional core. It's a welcome trend for me and has changed my opinion on both of those songs.

It was also just a surprising hilarious film altogether. I was expecting it to be funny, but not nearly as funny as it actually was. The awkward scenes at the Catholic school, the way that Kyle first mentions his father's cancer, and the scene where Lady Bird's dad was just playing solitare while Lady Bird and her mom fought all had me bent over laughing.

Just a beautifully orchestrated, loving, tender film about growing up and realizing that your parents are people too. Loved everything about it. I would have watched 8 more hours of it. The scene with Lucas Hedges crying into Ronan was the best  highlight for me (in a movie full of highlights). Almost started crying myself. The Ronan/Metcalf relationship was unbelievably real & familiar.

The most laughs I've had at a theater this year (mixed in with teary-eyed moments). Just a great script, direction, performances.

Greta Gerwig can do no wrong at this point. Ronan's accent was super impressive and she jumped to number one on my Best Actress prediction so far. Chalamet's character was great, his delivery gave me a Nicolas Cage vibe for some reason (no idea why, doesn't make sense, but made me laugh a bit).

Also, what a year for Tracy Letts. The Post, Lady Bird, The Lovers. Didn't like that last one at all, but that's an impressive year.

Easily top 5 of the year, 9/10. The scene with Lady Bird and Danny outside the back of the coffee shop broke my heart. So well acted on both side. Cried my eyes out. One of the best debuts of all time.

""I'm sorry I wanted more."" When Timothee Chamelet's character said ""that's hella tight"" I was the loudest laugh in the theater. This is a beautiful movie, easily the best I've seen this year and one of my favourite coming-of-age movies period.

Every part is perfectly cast and expertly played. Ronan and Metcalf will get the Oscar attention, but the whole ensemble deserves recognition. 

The scene where Lady Bird is in Sister Sarah Joan's office and they discuss how there's no difference between love and paying attention is a perfect way to encapsulate the entire movie.

An actual 10/10. See this movie.  Lucas Hedges is absolutely killing it right now. Played a major role in three straight releases that will likely be Best Picture nominations (Manchester by the Sea, Lady Bird, Three Billboards). And an Oscar nomination for himself in there, as well.  I liked that we didn't get the cliche airport scene at the end. The Mom got there too late and that was that. That's life sometimes... Honestly was surprised by the powerful punch at the end of the film.  As a guy, I don't know what relationships are like between mother and daughter, so it was refreshing to see a film that seemed pretty authentic in it's depiction of a mother and daughter.  Loved the performances and hope it picks up a few Oscar nods so more people will see this wonderful film. Wow. Hope this gets all the recognition it deserves. Absolutely in the top three movies I've seen this year. Saorise Ronan is amazing. What a debut for Greta Gerwig.  This film is one of two things:

1. For the people who relate to it: painful, cuttingly real, upsetting, difficult, emotionally triggering to the point that someone might relive the emotional abuse of their adolescent years...

2. For the people who don't relate to it: a pretty good movie, yeah like the acting is good and stuff, interesting... Man having gone to Catholic high school, everything was just so dead on perfect. I laughed so hard at the JV coach becoming the drama teacher and they way he was still like a coach to them. Or the anarchist kid who’s still going to a private high school. So many great little touches like that.

Yeah I’ll admit it, I cried at the end. Wasn’t even expecting it, just a very perfect kind of melancholy. I also grew up in kind of a boring town but they way she talked about driving it for the first time and relating it her mom was so touching. What a perfect way to end a film.

Can we just point out we are in a quiet amazing time for teen movies this decade? Easy A, The Spectacular Now, Diary of a Teenage Girl, The Edge of Seventeen and now I think the best of them yet Lady Bird. I think we are finally having directors reflecting on the more poppy teen romances and trying to make something more grounded and honest. 

Last thing this is probably my favorite film of the year (check back with me in a week to see where I feel then) and if Saoirse and Gerwig could make do like a Before Trilogy thing and just make a film Lady Bird about Lady Bird every 10 years that would just be the best. Or at least please work together again.

Okay serious last thing but who knew the guy who wrote Bug and Killer Joe could play like the most charming, cuddly dad in movie history? As someone who was in the orbit of several people who went to Catholic high school in Sacramento in the late 90s and early 00s this movie is dead on.

The movie is near-perfect at encapsulating all the things that make Sacramento unique and the things that always annoyed you, but you didn't realize you love until you leave the city.

I loved the little bits of local character like New Hel and The American Market on 24th.

The only way it could have been more nostalgic for me is if they recreated the back patio of the True Love. Lady Bird walking to the church in New York and making that call to her mom is probably my favorite moment of 2017. The cuts between her and her mom driving though Sacramento gave me the biggest smile. Just everything about it was perfect.

Movie really is something special. So happy Greta is getting all this love, and Saoirse was amazing. Probably my fav of 2017 When I was in high school, I wanted more than anything to go to Sarah Lawrence. I wasn't so much searching-for-culture as Lady Bird was, more of a ""this is the kind of place where writers come from"" sort of a thing. By the time my senior year came by, I didn't even apply, for two reasons. One was a sudden fear of being so far from literally everyone and everything I knew. The other was the realization that my parents had not only never HEARD of application fees, but that coming up with them suddenly was genuinely a hardship. I graduated in 2007, not 2003, I went to public school and not Catholic school, and I was honestly a lot more like Julie than Lady Bird, but goddamn did this movie hit on more than a few unexpected tender spots. 

On an aside, the tears started at the climax, because, God, my mom's favorite punishment was the silent treatment. Often inflicted on the whole family, who usually honestly couldn't tell you who did what.  A lot of scenes between Lady Bird and her mother are just stories right out of my own book. It brought back bad memories and made me feel absolutely awful. I almost cried when they were in the fitting room and she asked “but do you like me?” 

My mother is exactly the same: passive aggressive and never satisfied with what I do. She also didn’t want me to go to a university far from home because she was almost obsessed with the idea of me never leaving her side, and I fought for it just like Lady Bird. And like Lady Bird, I love her and know how much she loves me but can’t help admitting that she doesn’t like me as a person and we will likely never truly understand each other. 

As the only 20 year old girl in the theatre, I felt I might be the only person who really empathized and understood Lady Bird’s entire perceptive. The old ladies around me were all kind of amused. This was an awesome movie. Having just entered Freshman year of college, it's weird now to be older than the kids going through these coming of age stories. I hope that unique stories like these continue to be relatable as I get older. Movies like these make me really not want to be a grown up.  This film was a barrage of these small moments that were relatable, sad and funny (often all at once). The scene where Christine is just begging her mother to talk to her stands out for me as absolutely heartwrenching. Saoirse perfectly captured that desperate, fearful need of a child finally experiencing a parent's withholding of attention. That scene alone I'd give her an award for, and that goes without mentioning her superb job all through the film, with great supporting performances as well. You know who I liked? The dopey dad. Just seeing him staring down at the ground, pausing his inane card game on the family Dell, while his wife and only daughter dig their heels in a particularly nasty spat, was such a memorable image. ",1,Lady Bird
50," I watched it blind and really enjoyed it. It works as an emotional horror film with some genuinely chilling moments. The mixing of the real world horrors of refugees with the supernatural horror elements was genius. It did seem to follow some cliche-haunted house tropes but I suspect that was on purpose to allow the audience to feel familiar in an unfamiliar narrative.

The sunset scene in the ocean is stunning and the meeting of the witch in the dark was haunting (great voice actor).

Some of the ""ghosts"" had a great design while others did look a bit cheesy.

For the performances alone it's worth a watch (Wunmi Mosaku is great in everything she's in). 

I did speak to a friend who thought it was ""boring"", so I guess you can't please everyone. I thought it was fantastically crafted. The creature/ghost effects were really well done. Some say it wasn't that scary, but it made my wife scream a couple of times, and we watch a LOT of horror movies. I liked everything about this movie except the explicitly horror parts. The first act of the movie and the revelation about their daughter i.e their horrors not being explicitly about what they had seen getting to where they are but also what they had to do to get there was very well done.  

The feeling of isolation within the community and being refugees in modern UK was also very well done and felt very true to life (both good and bad--the kids being xenophobic, the social workers being somewhat cold and distainful but ultimately helpful, the local pub offering help and giving Bol an opportunity to bond with them through singing). 

However, the final act and the impact of the ghosts (or the demon or the witch, I'm unclear of the terminology here but the esoteric nature of it does kind of adds to the spookiness) felt like it wrapped up the movie too neatly with a happily ever after ending. It lost the nuance that had been presented throughout the movie by giving their grief, their guilt, and their past a single entity that they had to overcome to free themselves. Bol says ""Your ghosts follow you. They never leave."" but it feels contradictory to the tone of the movie's end.

That all said, it's a great debut from Remi Weekes and I look forward to seeing more of his voice in future movies, it seems he has a lot to say and the know-how to make some great films hopefully. I loved this movie. I didn’t expect or was able to predict any of the scenes. It captivated me from beginning to end. 

I picked to watch it because it looked different - it broke the mould by casting black actors which grabbed my attention as most horror films have a white cast. I was intrigued when it transpired that the main characters were Sudanese refugees in public housing in a congested, noisy, working-class, urban district in England instead of the horror trope most of us are familiar with - upper-class, white people who silently suffer in a vast, isolated Victorian-style mansion set in a remote, country locality.  As the story developed, I was drawn into it as I wondered and questioned whether there were, in fact, spirits tormenting this couple in this house or if it was all in their head as a result of the trauma they had suffered. 

I thought the film was very clever because it played on a stereotype many have heard or associate with recipients of public housing – that they are ungrateful and undeserving of this largess because they completely destroy the beautiful houses that they have been provided. We see from the reaction of the government officials how most people would view Bol’s act of stripping all the wallpaper off and leaving huge holes in the walls.  Only the audience  was privy to the mental torment that drove Bol to this act with his hammer. It provided us insight into the world of the people who we judge according to our standards from our privileged background.

I think the film is very clever as it managed to skilfully subvert the horror genre by revealing that the horror each of us live with each day in our real world is far scarier, a point made by Rial who reminds Bol that  she is not scared of ghosts after everything she has seen and experienced in her traumatic life. The film has a universal theme that many of us can relate to – so many of us battle with our personal horrors when the choices we have made in the past and their consequences which we live with now fill us with guilt, shame, mental torment and constantly compel us to question whether we are ‘good people’?

I liked the way the film ended by showing that the people who we meet in our lives, though no longer physically with us, never truly leave us because the ghosts of our encounters with them follow us everywhere we go. It wasn't scary in a traditional sense, but the movie did a good job of cultivating a creepy atmosphere and I liked the design of the witch and the ghosts as well as showcasing a bit of African culture.

Really though, the way they used the witch and ghosts to represent survivor's guilt was very effective and well done.  What's sad and scary is that atrocities like those depicted occur every day and people will do what it takes to survive, but not without a psychological and emotional toll.

I don't see myself ever revisiting the movie, but I'm glad I watched it and appreciated the subject matter and execution.  I do think the second act meandered a bit, but I thought the revelation that it wasn't their daughter was done well and that perhaps in the second act it would've been better to show more of their attempts to adapt to their new lives than what we got. One thing that can always be said about horror movies is that they are a representation on cultural fears. I've seen a lot of people complain that the haunted house aspect ""wasn't scary enough"" or it ""relied on loud noises"" and I think that those people missed what made this movie worth a watch.

In the first 15 minutes, I wasn't scared of the ghost, but of what could happen to these two after seeing their asylum seekers status, the disdain for foreigners, and the glimpse of possible PTSD.  I am lucky enough to have never been in that situation, but knowing how real something like this could be is truely terrifying. Very good film! African folklore is very underrepresented in movies “You are a beast, and I am the butcher”


Oddly turned on I really loved Matt Smith's performance in the film. He did a great job showing his characters' contempt for immigrants while maintaining a calm attitude and actually being quite competent in his job of helping the couple.

 I really hope to see him in more antagonistic roles in the future. The whole ""your house is bigger than mine"" line got my blood boiling. Just watched it going in blind and I was very pleasantly surprised, it’s a solid film.  Great acting by both leads.  Good pacing and tension building.  The jump scares were seldom but were effective.  The makeup and horror elements were well done.  There were some beautiful shots in it, especially the slow pan out from the breakfast table to reveal the ocean.

And finally I really enjoyed the fresh perspective on the classic ‘haunted house’ trope... African refugees and African witchcraft/folklore was not something I knew I wanted, but it worked marvelously and I would welcome more of it.

Keeping an eye on this director.  His debut isn’t perfect but it was a great opening. I thought it was a fantastic way to showcase the effects of grief, guilt, and the desire to ""fit in"". Not super scary, but definitely chilling. The story imo is really well done that I honestly dont mind this not having too many scares. I like films that make me tense and that's exactly what the film did. The twist was amazing, acting was amazing. So this was pretty good...

I was hoping Matt Smith would have a larger role.

My original theory on the plot (based solely on the trailer) was that Matt Smith was playing an evil government employee secretly trying to drive out immigrants by poisoning their water supply with hallucinogenic drugs so they appeared crazy...

But the original plot was pretty good too. Kudos all around.

(but what was up with the creepy white neighbor lady? LOL) Very good horror film about survivor's guilt.

But if this were a different film, it could have gone down another perhaps more dangerous rabbit hole.

Namely, what lengths are you willing to go to survive? Is there any point where what you do to survive is immoral? And where is that fine line?

I feel like this film was structured to let Bol off the hook a bit, and give him a nicer send off. And that's fine; its a BBC film, they have their approach and ultimately did a good job. But I'd like to see this same theme explored with different parameters and harder questions asked. I know i'm a bit late.

But i found this movie to be great up until a certain point. Fantastic acting, great setting with the refugees in this weird feeling of isolation, great and creepy horror.



Everything was exceptional untill the hangtitty sackman came out of the ground and it casually gets its throat slit and covered up with a rug like wtf.


Still 90% of the movie was great quality, nothing to complaim about only praise. But the ending had me laughing almost Best film of the year. All the greatest horror films have subtext, there was a lot of it here. Visually great too, the scene when the dead were rising out of the water around him was striking. Also the last scene were you see the divide between the survivors and the people who didn't make it. It's brilliant that shot ended up being the poster for the film, by the end you understand why. I loved it. It felt like a somewhat freshman film but that was refreshing honestly.

I loved the imagery and the ghost. The story of the migrant experience. The surrealism. The maze scene was very tense imo. Watch Spell. It was freaky and pretty good. It's like Misery with voodoo. This movie gave me the chills and also the feels. Definitely not a ‘scary’ movie by any means, but really effective use of horror elements to illustrate  the trauma/survivors guilt/ isolation etc. that asylum seekers can experience. Best horror I’ve seen since Midsommar and The House That Jack Built! I love how emotional and real this got, and it works as both a ghost story (backed by folklore) and a drama about survivors guilt. Very moving, and fucking scary at parts! The witch during the dream scene is so memorable. Incoming nightmares. Come to /r/horror for more discussion  about it! This movie is by far my favourite horror of 2020 I loved it, I have a question tho, how did Rial not know Nyagak was not her daughter? She asks the night witch to see her daughter, how does she not know she's not her daughter? Watched this tonight. Sure, might have been slightly cliché with some of the haunted house tropes, but that is a very very minor criticism- mixing it with the immigrant/refugee experience, as well as African witchcraft, super unique. Loved it. ",0,His House
13," I enjoyed it, but I would have appreciated more discussion about the music and its creation in the studio.  It seemed to focus heavily on the culture that surrounded them, which is fine and intersting, but not enough on the actual music. It felt more like a John Cale and Lou Reed biographical documentary, rather than a music documentary.  It took too long to get to the creation of the VU, and not enough time on the demise of the VU, which felt like a small paragraph in this novel of a documentary.  

Still, I'm glad it was made. The Jonathan Richman interviews were fantastic.  I could watch a whole documentary of just him talking about the Velvet Underground. I recommend Owen Gleiberman's review, which I agree with 100%: [https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/)

As a casual (far from hardcore) fan, I was quite disappointed in the coverage. Would have liked to see much more on the post-Cale albums (especially the 1969 self-titled) and on the reunion. Doug Yule is once again completely memory holed. So unfair given that he was nothing but a professional and had a major part to play in two excellent albums that have a place in music history. No mention at all of the Velvets' significance in Eastern Europe: [https://www.kcrw.com/music/articles/how-the-velvet-underground-influenced-the-velvet-revolution](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-velvet-underground-review-todd-haynes-john-cale-lou-reed-1235013500/) and how that played into how they were received in the 90s right after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Very little screen time for Moe Tucker. No Laurie Anderson (she must have refused to participate but her absence is glaring). Reed's sexuality is treated awkwardly, almost with embarrassment. Not even a nod to Candy's trans identity in ""Candy Says."" I could go on.

There were some really moving and interesting parts, especially about Cale and Reed's childhoods, reactions from audiences while on tour, East and West Coast rock rivalry, Nico's aspirations, and so on. The visual style is effective, suits a prestige doc - but it's too niche and experimental as an intro to the band and too cursory for fans. It should have been a two-parter for streaming like last year's Laurel Canyon rather than trying to cram everything into a 2-hour theatrical feature. I'm about to watch it. Just so you know, the podcast No Dogs In Space just started a series on TVU. Episode one was great, and the podcast is always a great balance of fun, and in-depth research. Saw it in the Big Screen at London Film Festival. The music sounded incredible on a massive sound system. Didn't really care for it.

The first hour or so was boring, I wanted to watch a documentary on The Velvet Underground, not whatever that was.

When they finally get into the music part, everything gets glossed over.

A quick look at their Wikipedia and it says that the drummer soent the 80's working at Walmart which seems insane. It's technically well made... but it's reverent to a fault. I kept getting reminded of how Bohemian Rhapsody felt because it alluded to many things but was more interested in being stylish than it was substantial. I would've preferred a slightly more objective approach. I love The Velvet Underground & Nico, one of the best albums ever Will watch it next week in theater. Will come back here If only it was on anything but Apple TV :( I agree, it was a 2 hour documentary, but it seemed to dwell a lot on the tangential stuff, and not so much on the music. It was still good, but not so much a documentary about the band, more a film surrounding the scene that birthed them. The interviews were cool though. I have to say I wholeheartedly disagree. If you want to know that side of the story there’s a thousand Uncut and Mojo articles about ‘the creation of The Velvet Underground and Nico’. Haynes does an exceptional job of visually telling the story of New York in the 60’s/the whole Warhol art scene without the film ever feeling didactic or like you’re just watching someone (who is usually tangential to the scene) tell you what happened. Jonathan is the only person who can play the role of the ‘talking head’ and is fucking awesome. Great music film, I’d actually say the best right next to Don’t Look Back. I strongly agree with this,wish there was more in the doc about Angus MacLise and his time in the band Not a bad review, but the guy says HATES their second album. What the absolute fuck? I can't really take him seriously after that. Todd Haynes made a commitment that he would include only people who were contemporaries to the Velvets. Doug Yule was invited to participate but refused. Laurie Anderson who met Lou several decades later, has nothing to do with the VU. I would say I am a fan of TVU, but not a diehard, and really enjoyed No Dogs Left In Space covering the Velvet Underground for I think 5 podcast episodes.  I went into this doc expecting a compressed version of that story, with talking heads, actual music, and whatever footage may still exist from that time period. 

What I got was a seemingly meandering first third/half, then onto a bit of the first few albums, a quick gloss over the collapse of the band, Andy's dead, here's the credits.  

I wanted something with more substance.  Dive into Lou Reed's post VU career for 2 minutes, touch on how Mo turned political decades later, talk about how Songs for Drella could have been a true reunion album, there's so much out there, but what we got was mostly smoke. Thanks, I'll have to give that a listen! Oh I missed that - guess I don’t agree 100%! Yeah, with a week's worth of hindsight I can understand his choices better and appreciate the film for what it is. But in the moment I was left unsatisfied and I still probably won't revisit or recommend it. ",0,The Velvet Underground

""Hook him up to the gas coffin."" That final scene was so badass  Honestly one of the most disturbing parts for me was the kid almost drowning in the corn silo. Born and raised in the Midwest, it’s engrained in you from a young age not to fuck around with those things because so many people have died that way.  How did those raccoons live for almost 500 days?! I just want to say congrats to my theatre for staying quiet the whole film The entire movie I couldn't stop wondering on what their bathroom situation was.  [deleted] I loved the movie and am planning on seeing it again soon! But I was hoping another viewer could help me understand why the dad seemed so adamant[that the daughter not go down into the basement](#spoiler). The gravity and intensity of the scene forbidding her descent didn't match the actual consequences of her going down there. [When you hear that toy go off when you specifically said it was too loud.](https://i.redd.it/ydrdbdpupml01.jpg) The short stretch from when Blunt crawls into the tub to when the fireworks explode and she finally dares to open her mouth and scream in pain... With Krasinski tearing up the path as you see the fireworks explode in the background?

That was dopeee. 
 In this movie sleep apnea will literally kill you. Fuck that nail.  [deleted] I really liked it except I wanted to laugh really hard whenever they showed his whiteboard. Did he really need ""Attacks Sounds"" and ""What is the weakness"" written down in giant letters? Did anyone else notice that in the supermarket, everything was gone except for the things in noisy plastic bags like chips? I thought that was a wonderful touch. When the monster was in the water with Emily Blunt and her baby, I thought she was going to have to smother it. My heart just dropped as that happened. I got MASH finale flashbacks. Me: ""I bet those batteries he took for the rocket ship will end up saving them at the end of the movie."" 

Me five minutes later: ""Fuck.""
 I've been in many horror theater showings, typically you get a couple screamers.

This is the first time a sold out theater was dead silent. Almost as if the audience was terrified to make a peep.

Well done John, well done. That kid was right. The rocket ship did take him somewhere... I knew when Evelyn told Lee to take care of the kids he'd for sure die but it didn't make it any less crushing when it happened. I loved his send off. 

I don't think I could live in this world, I'd go the same route as that old guy and just sacrifice myself. Either that or get killed right away since I snore.  Someone tell me why I've been trying to be as silent as possible ever since I walked out of this theater. I turned on my car and the sound of the engine almost gave me a heart attack  Glad the waterfall scene was there for the audience to realize where/how they conceived the baby ",0,A Quiet Place
52," Nyles: ""So this is your life?""

Roy: ""Not bad, huh? Beautiful wife, beautiful kids... little Joey is watering dog shit."" Oh man this was such a great film. It has a perfect balance between the typical Romantic Comedy, and a SciFi film. I was nervous they’d end it with an ambiguous ending on wether they got out, but it’s one of those few movies where I’m glad we got the happy ending. I love Roy's reaction when he realized Sarah's plan worked.

Anyway, I just think it is a pretty fitting romcom to watch right now in the situation like this when we feel like yesterday is today, today is today, and tomorrow is today. Did the Grandma get out? “It’s not good wine” every wedding bartender ever Good movie in general but great quarantine movie when days start to feel the same. Although it does make me want to start drinking at 9 in the morning. The “let’s waste some time” montage was just so fucking perfect. All I could think about was how shitty it would have been if Roy went to sleep before seeing Sarah's message lol Cristin Milioti has a knack for meshing with everyone on screen, she’s just extremely charming.  But man...her and samburg were next level perfect.  Chemistry out the wazoo. Great movie. I love that they included a scene at the end to show that they told Roy. I was really worried the movie would just forget about him after his resolution with Nyles. To say this movie was needed right now is a vast understatement. This film was such a fucking delight from start to finish. 

One of the many things I have to praise the film for is just how well paced the first 20 minutes are. You get Nyles and his problems all laid out just in the opening scene alone, him having everything planned out even before the inevitable time loop reveal (the dance at the wedding was pretty obvious toward that), trying to get at Sarah with his casual wedding toast which leads to them hooking up, and when she jumps into the time loop and enters “the next day”, it’s so well edited from both of their POV’s, I kept smiling the whole way through as to just how on point the whole opening felt. Very rare for comedies to have that kind of pacing.

Samberg and Milioti have such remarkable chemistry between each other that it didn’t feel like a chore to sit through when this whole concept has been done countless times. 

The movie did a lot of stuff that felt refreshing and unique, but the two scenes that stood out to me were after Sarah runs over Roy and Nyles explains to Sarah that they can still feel pain leading up to one of the twists. It made you sympathize with both of them because you would have to get to a point to be where Sarah is at in being stuck in that time-loop for god knows how long and Nyles having already felt those feelings numerous times. 

The second scene being Roy and Nyles having their heart to heart at Roy’s house. It’s a scene not a lot of screenwriters would add, but because they did, it gave them so much emotional heft as to what they have both been going through and having that understanding of the struggles of being stuck in the time-loop forever. A comedy made me feel that existential reality!

This is hands down one of my favorite movies of the year, even if all of the releases were to have come out if the ‘Rona didn’t happen, still would’ve been in my Top 10 of the Year!

The only thing that sucks is not being able to experience this in a theater with a packed crowd, so many of the jokes would’ve killed in a theater... I just miss watching movies in a theater, especially comedies. Well that was super fun! Had some really good gags, I loved the bomb in the cake. Maybe I am alone in this, but for *Palm Springs*, *Russian Doll* and *Groundhog Day*, I feel like I would happily watch an extended cut with even more nihilistic time loop shenanigans without getting bored at all. I understand why it has to be done in a snappy montage since hijacking planes or learning silly dance routines does not advance the story, but it's such a fun premise to watch actors play around in. [deleted] Cristin Milioti’s role in this reminded me a lot of her role in Black Mirror’s USS Callister. I wonder if the director casted her because of that. Excellent film, loved every second of it. I truly loved it. I’m not a fan of rom coms for a while , with the exception of Netflix Set it up, but, this really is worth the watch. Andy and Cristin are brilliant together. One of my favorite movie experiences this year >*Your best bet is to learn to suffer existence*

This line, man. This line. Naming him Nyles when his entire persona is based on Nihilism is just so clever. This is a brilliant movie, actually somehow has a fairly unique take on the whole time loop idea. 

Works so much better having Niles have already been in it for ages before he's joined by someone new. Basically got the best of both worlds when it came to skipping over the ""lets try this to get out"" but still get a couple of good gags in there like the suicide.

Glad they managed to get a message to Roy at the end too.

 Though I think the new husband is a total scumbag, snorting lines on his wedding day and cheating on his wife who was saving herself for marriage with her sister...what are we supposed to think he's actually going to be a good husband now? He did literally nothing redeeming the whole movie...

""One of those Shaggy Dogs"" was a great last line though.

Also the granny was totally in the loop right? Please tell me someone else caught that? >After Credits Scene? No

/u/mi-16evil there is a mid-credits scene Okay okay okay. Is Sara's grandma stuck in the time loop?? She has that throwaway line about her mom also dying when she was young, and then she says good luck - Sara will need it. This is different to what she says to Niles when he gives a great speech. Is she in the loop?? Does she know? Thoughts??? I'm a big fan of Andy Samberg and The Lonely Islamd in general, but going into this I had no idea of the premise whatsoever. Only knew it was a Romcom with sci-fi elements.

When I realized they were pulling a Groundhog Day I was expecting disappointment.

Somehow, they not only pulled it off, but completely nailed it. I love that they kept some of the silliness and ridiculousness that are Lonely Island hallmarks, but found a way to create almost an arthouse version of it. Just watched it with my Wife and we both very much enjoyed it. I had no idea at all what it was about and that really helped, people need to see it blind.

Will it come to bluray eventually? Would love to own a copy. I just never get sick of timeloop stories. This one is a nice addition to that genre. ""Guess they come back November 10th."" 

HA! ",0,Palm Springs
114," sliding the guys neck back and forth across the broken car door window shook me It was not good.

The opening scene with the raid on the russian safehouse was a strong start, but that, unfortunately, seemed to be the movie's peak. I'm not honestly sure what I was expecting from a Mark Wahlberg-starring action movie, but I was drawn in by Iko Uwais' name having seen The Raid 1 and 2. Iko's bone crunching physicality, however, was disgracefully butchered by an over indulgence in rapid cuts and shaky camera. The action doesn't get better with the gun fights either, they all boil down to c*ut to gun, cut to bullet hole, cut to other guy's gun, cut to another bullet hole, repeat*.

The action portion of this action movie was disappointing. What about the rest? Well, Marky Mark plays the character of Marky Mark with a gun, I guess? It's up to you whether or not you're into that. Overall, there were no blatant cases of terrible acting, but nothing was good. I can't even remember any of their names. The premise and plot were fairly basic and hard to mess up with a good ol' ""gotcha"" twist in the end, so the story was far from the worst aspect. With nothing else to elevate the story, whether it be good acting or good action, the movie doesn't stand out in anyway. You can tell at moments that the movie really tried to make some cryptic and dark comments on government affairs, but the closest it got was a couple presidential bobbleheads. The usual /r/im14andthisisdeep stuff.

It all boils down to bad action, bland acting, and a boringly unoriginal Hollywood script.

Also, don't ionize those *proteins* kids. Hiroshima and Nagasaki happen when you ionize those god-damn proteins. Really hoping the RT score ends up at 22% The guy sitting in front of me walked out halfway through the movie. Tells you how good the movie was. This is the kind of movie you watch for 10 minutes on ~~Spike~~ Paramount Network and then you leave to do something else during the commercials, but you never come back to watch. There were multiple scenes where Mark Wahlberg and his crew were ostensibly speaking english, but I could not comprehend what was being said because it was so fast. The action scenes also looked like they were edited by someone, mid-seizure. Chuckled audibly at the

Its not good. I think adding Steven Seagal would have made it better.  The only good thing about this movie is that at one point Iko Uwais says to Mark Wahlberg ""say hi to your mother for me"" Shout out to Iko Uwais I hope he gets more shine in brutal action movies he’s so good. He’s so good. He’s so good. NOTE for if you still haven't seen it yet:

Each time you blink you miss about 6 cuts so be careful. I'd recommend some sort of tongs to keep your eyes open. Or don't see it. Your choice Is Eminem in this one? That was some of the worst fucking editing I’ve seen in a theatrical released film This movie was such a disappointment. 

I didn't understand the plot about Annie's family. Went nowhere. 

No reason for the plot point about Wahlberg being super smart. 

No reason for the big reveal of ""say hello to your mother"" like we should be surprised he knows about mother - they were yelling to mother the whole movie!

Why leave Annie's fate so ambiguous? If there's a sequel they'll show that she actually killed the other guy and was alive? ""Do you want to talk about what happened to Annie?"" I don't care what happened to her. 

The ONLY thing I actually care about is that the bad guys won in this movie after all. That's something you rarely see. Although there was a lot of plot armor and bullet misses on the main characters, it was great that the bad guys won at the end.  I quite enjoyed that part.  It only took Bruce Willis 16 blocks to deliver his guy. Maybe if they shortened it by 20 miles?  what a clusterfuck of a movie. This is just one of those ""where to even begin?"" with problems.

* Firstly, I don't remember hating a main character as much as I hated Mark Wahlberg in this movie. I get being an asshole was 'his thing' but this was just another level. Shitty backstory made for a real shitty character with absolutely zero redeeming characteristics. His monologues were hilariously bad. He just shits on everyone in his team at every opportunity. His 'tick' was more an annoyance than anything.
* The baddies would risk World War 3 over some personal vendetta? What?
* Peter Berg's cameo was so unnecessary and laughable.
* Wahlberg & Cohan do not make for a good duo at all. Also, they go around breaking shit and leaving? What was up with that lol? 
* How many grenades could they possibly have? I swear they used like 30 of them during this movie. They were just getting thrown left and right.
* Ronday Rousey is such a terrible actress. They didn't kill her off fast enough. Also, ""fucking nerds!"", is on track to be the single-worst line in movies this year. There's really no competition.
* ""Let's explode 2 grenades 5 feet away from us and hide behind this mattress. We'll be alright.""
* The 'laughs' all felt cheap and undeserved.
* Iwo Kuwais was inches/seconds away from dying every few minutes but this entire movie/plot/attack/etc depended on him surviving until the very end. That was really shitty planning.
* The bad guys were just idiot bullet-fodders the whole movie. The body count was stupidly-high. Who cares about action scenes if they're so goddamn unrealistic?
* The Overwatch team in general was an incompetent, bumbling group of idiots. I can't imagine/believe that 
 hundreds of thousands of peoples' lives would depend on them.
* That entire first mission was probably the single worst special forces mission of all time. It was such a simple thing that they had locked down. Then one of their agents dies and it's just like 'eh, whatever, just another Tuesday. Like what? That was a disaster.
* This is Berg's Mission Impossible-lite with no heart or brains. It's sequel-bait trash. Also, really bad sequel bait. 
* Lauren Cohan's entire family/divorce thing was dumb. The part when she screams out 'Family Talks' or whatever during a top-secret mission briefing was mind-blowingly bad screenwriting.
* Complete waste of Iko Uwais. Could Peter Berg squeeze more cuts into his fights scenes?
* I can't handle John Malkovich with hair.
* So much more but I've wasted enough time with this movie. That was a long ass 90 minutes.

That ending lol. ""The entire team is dead except for the shittiest, most irritating character, please give us another $12 next year"" is not a good way to sell a sequel.

 Whoever edited this movie should never be allowed to edit anything ever again. The plot might not be great but the action is pretty cool. There's a guy who gets killed by getting his head dragged across a shattered car window, slitting his throat. **THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU ABOUT CESIUM AT MIT?!** RIP good Peter Berg x Mark Wahlberg movies 2013-2018 C'mon folks.  Just google ""China buys Hollywood"" to take you back 2 years when a Chinese billionaire was on a spending spree.  This movie (Mile 22) is  a result of that effort, an eastern movie with western actors.  Plain and simple.  I still love watching old Bruce Lee movies (as crappy as they are). Loved how Silva magically turns into Ben Affleck's 'The Accountant' character during the opening title sequence. Another question: why did the bad guys let Walberg's crew slowly get out of the car and escape into the apartments while also setting up the injured guy behind the car? I dont get the hate, its mark whalburg cussing and shooting guns for an hour a half. Exactly what I expected  ",0,Mile 22

― Groucho Marx So I understand that this isn't really a perfect movie. It's a little bit hurried, and the characters and story aren't anything to go nuts over...

But dammit, I've missed this Spielberg for so long. We sort of got it with Tintin, but this is the shamelessly sentimental, adventure loving Spielberg I grew up on, and the one that really made me love film. It's a fucking blast, and I absolutely loved it.

And holy shit, Olivia Cooke needs to be in more movies. She's talented as hell. What was that ship from which Gundam comes out of? I thought it resembled Serenity. I may be super wrong though.  Say what you will about the plot (which I enjoyed), but goddamn can Spielberg direct an action scene. The first challenge race and the final battle were some of the coolest, funnest action sequences I've seen in a long time. Sometimes I forget that Spielberg is the king of the blockbuster for a reason. The moment when everyone in the cinema gasped at the reveal that the quarter is giving Parzival an extra life is seared into my brain. Love it. Can someone please explain to me how everyone figured out where the last challenge was and how they figured out ot was in a video game? I felt like part of the movie just got chopped out and I missed that part Wait so there were cops the whole time?! IOI is literally abducting people and forcing them into camps and the police only show up at the very end?!  The Shining sequence absolutely blew my mind. So incredibly fun to see Spielberg dip into *his* inner fanboy and pay tribute to his former mentor with such a detailed recreation of the Overlook and Room 237. The images were so clear as well! Wonder if they used original footage and restored it or if everything was digitally recreated. Any pg13 film that uses its one ""fuck"" to have a random dude scream ""it's fuckin Chucky!"" Is alright by me. I was ready for a ""You stay. I go"" moment from Iron Giant. Pleasantly surprised they went with the ending of T2! This had some truly staggering scenes, there were times when I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.

That said, it is very hokey in places and has pacing issues and characters just randomly appearing to help the protagonist at just the right moment.

That Shining scene though, Holy fuck and the race sequence and the Mecha godzilla.

Jesus.  Simon Pegg playing an American imitating a British accent gave me a chuckle That fucker played Oddjob in GoldenEye. Did anyone notice the film grain during the shining sequence? I thought that was a really cool little detail Is it me or did the Asian dude have replicant eyes when he was holding Nolan at gunpoint? ""You killed my mom's sister!"" 
You mean Aunt? How the hell do you throw the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch without counting to 3 (5) first?  I think the thing this movie lacked most was the feeling of time. In the book sometimes months or a year would go by in between finding a clue or gaining a key. And in that time a lot of character and relationship building happens, that you just lose in the film. Having Wade tell Artemis he loved her basically their first date was just a little cringey for me. I wanted to see them build their relationship, see him get dumped, see him try to redeem himself within the IOI system and then they finally meet in the real world. Time is what I feel the movie was missing. Did anyone else find it weird how the movie basically skims over the death of Wade’s aunt? I know they weren’t really close, but there’s not even one moment of mourning for the woman who helped raise him. It cuts immediately from “murder of family” to “awkward romance”. Felt like a distracting tonal shift. This whole time...  all I wanted was one asshole shouting ""Leeroy Jenkins"" and then, quickly getting vaporized. “I will choose the form of Gundam!”
Theater goes wild Are you seriously telling me that in four years not one single person decided to just fuck about and drive backwards on that race? Shout out to the one dude which out of EVRYTHING that he could be, he chose to be a fucking skeleton. Did it annoy anyone else that hundreds of citizens in the stacks were defending Wade until the second one man pulls out a pistol? ",0,Ready Player One
101," Honestly, she could have done a better job cleaning up the dog poo.  Just an observation.   One scene that really sticks with me is when [Cleo went to find Fermin at the karate training ground, and the odd martial arts teacher did the pose that he said only the strongest people could do... but Cleo did it with ease.] (#spoiler)   I took this as a sign that she had the internal strength to deal with everything she was going to experience throughout the rest of the film.

Anyways, completely immersive movie. So beautifully shot. My favorite of the year. I really enjoyed it. I read somewhere that this film was the director/creator’s “love letter to the women in his life.”

I am a woman, and a mother, so certain things I was able to understand and feel deeply.

I was raised by a maid in Venezuela, so I really connected with Cleo and how much she loved the kids, who in turn also loved her very much. Those women work very hard, for little pay, from sun up til sun down. Not a glamorous job, but a very important one.

Several things I noticed....the whole concept of women being all alone...it was the women who ran the family. The husband just showed up when he felt like it. The fact that everyone babied the youngest child made me think of how women might have a bit of a hand in raising these “spoiled” men.

I was struck by the fact that even though the family claimed to love Cleo, they don’t treat her equally. In the scene where they are sitting in the bench eating ice cream, Cleo is standing while everyone is sitting. A sign of how her struggle and pain is unacknowledged. She is there to work.

The dogs throughout the film made me think of the loyalty of women, especially the maids. They put up with a lot of shit from their husbands/employers.

The ocean scene showed me that Cleo loved those kids enough to risk her own life for them. As I watched them bobbing up and down it made me think that the family (Cleo included) could weather any storm, as long as they were together.

I thought it was funny that the husband took the bookcases. What’s a bookcase without books? Nothing. Just empty space. The heart of the bookcase are the books.  The heart of the home is the family. The husband left and took only the empty shell, leaving behind the one thing that gave his life any value—his family. I saw this in theaters almost two weeks ago and I firmly believe that the *spoiler* the riot scene is one of the best shots of recent history. The way the riot breaks out through the window and then transitions into the inside of the mattress store all in one shot is masterful. I have never sobbed because of a movie before but Cleo's delivery scene reduced me to shambles. It wasn't just the fact that her baby girl was born dead, but the casual, almost anesthetized manner in which the doctors and nurses talked to her. I completely lost it when they asked Cleo if she would like to meet her daughter and then that it was time to say goodbye almost immediately after.   


On a lighter note, one of my favorite shots was the single take, 360 degree pan of Cleo turning off all the lights in the house before going to bed. It was a beautiful, nuanced scene, showing all of the little things that servants do to keep a household running. We often forget how much work it takes to maintain a home, from doing the dishes to cleaning up after children and pets.  I watched this movie with my mother in theaters, and it was one of best bonding moments we had recently. She was raised near Colonia Roma, where this movie takes place. She cried three times in this movie. According to her, how this movie sets the 1970s setting was beautiful. She told me that watching this film was like watching a memory of hers play on the screen.  For the first half you’re like ok this is going to be a really well-shot art film slash character study then Cuarón is like bitch you thought I loved Cleo’s dynamic with little Pepe. He was such a sweetie. Also really liked how the mother had these outbursts and flaws but ultimately was such a kind, compassionate, and strong figure.  There's so many shots in this film that make you think ""How the hell did they pull this off?"" Not just the big, showy long takes, like the fire or the massacre. But the little things, too, like the reflection of an airplane framed perfectly in a puddle of water during the opening credits, or a little horned frog skittering along the ground in close-up.

This movie is filled with little touches like that, that make it feel real in every way. The way Cleo makes coffee, the way the movie theater is recreated, the way one character says to another that the Cowboys won the Super Bowl because the Baltimore Colts got cocky, then sticks to that statement even when reminded that Baltimore still won. Even the sound mix feels incredibly immersive. If you can't see this in a theater or even on a TV, make sure to watch it with headphones. This is clearly a passion project for Cuarón, and it shows.

Yes, I know I haven't talked about the story yet. It's a slowly-paced slice-of-life movie, with no big showy scenes until the last half-hour. And if you're not into that, you probably won't like it as much. But while it has nowhere near the tension of Cuarón's last two films (and really, which films do?), it's still a great screenplay about domestic life, women's struggles, class issues, political turmoil, childhood, and the movies, and that's just off the top of my head. 

If the ending didn't land for you, for me it can be summed up by the inscription that appears at the end of the credits. ""Shantih Shantih Shantih"" (please tell me if I get the following explanation horribly wrong). It's a Sanskrit mantra that also appears at the end of T.S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land"", and is a prayer used to signify the end of an Upanishad. It represents peace, rest, calmness, tranquility, or bliss. There's some big changes going on, in Cléo's life, in the family, and in the world, but everything's gonna be all right. She's at peace with everything that's happened to her over the course of the year. Shantih Shantih Shantih. I knew something bad was going to happen to Celo's baby when her glass broke for the toast.  It's very hard as a Mexican to describe Roma. It's a love letter to Mexico, encapsulated in Mexico City. It's a letter to the country we are, from the tenderss of our abuelitas to the oppressive regime we had for 70 years and now threatens to return. The upper classes shooting guns in the woods and the lower classes living in the slums of Neza. Going for a baby crib and being a witness of incredible repression from the government.

What we are. For better or worse

But most of all, Roma is the most loving letter to women and the loneliness that can result from feeling abandoned, like Sofia said ""at the end, us women are alone"" this doesn't mean that as a gender they have gained tremendous ground but at the end of it, a lot of our moms can mirror themselves in Sofia and Cleo.  Whle Sofia was a mess her husband was bumping shoulders with his lover, while Cleo made a long trip to see Fermin, he was literally kung fu fighting.

And at the end, Cleo had the love of her kids (because they were as much as Sofias) to power through, and Cuaron ends it with ""Para Libo"" which was his Cleo.

I didn't see a better film this year. It deserves every bit of praise and I don't see how Cuaron can lose best director. The first shot of this movie is what film is all about. Cuaron managed to make a maid cleaning dog shit be the most beautiful intro to a film I've seen in a long time. I remember it was really quiet and I was a bit like ""okay....floor shot for awhile I guess"" but as soon as it clicked what was going on I was fucking in. FUCK this movie is so beautiful. The symbolism in this film was incredible. As a son coming from a split family, the shot of the Cleo and the family sitting silently eating ice cream after announcing what their father did, with a wedding in the backdrop, had me in tears. Made me admire the beauty that love pushes on regardless of the loss of it, that it isn't as singular an emotion as we can selfishly think. I just wanted someone to take that poor dog for a walk. y'all saw those two ducks having sexual intercourse  “When I was older I used to be a sailor, but I drowned in a storm…” In time I might be able to adequately organise my thoughts about why *Roma* is the best movie I’ve seen in god-knows-how-long, but for now I’ll  say that I got a real kick out of Cuaron including that scene from *Marooned*, which was basically *Gravity* before *Gravity*. I wish I could have found out what this movie was about before watching it with my 4 month pregnant wife. I think it's absolutely amazing how much this movie sounds like the real Mexico City. You can put your head out of a window at anytime during the day and you'll most certainly hear a guys selling honey, the loud-as-fuck cart selling sweet potatoes, the garbage truck with the guy who walks by with the bell, all of them were, and still are, part of this city. A day Downtown actually sounds like in the movie with all the street vendors yelling trying to get peoples attention. It really sounds like the actual Mexico City, it's amazing.


Everyone's talking about Cleo, but the scene that really got me was the scene with Sofia and the kids at the restaurant near the end.

The day my father left, my mom took me to a restaurant and, just like in the movie, she told me, with a smile on her face and a look that was a mix of fear and bravery, that from now on it would only be the two of us and that things would be better. And they were. Just because of her. I love my mom Fuck Fermín I found Roma absolutely incredible. The best filmgoing experience I’ve had this year, maybe one of the best ever. It’s so hard for me to describe what made this special to me, but I think it comes down to just how alive it was. It was a little slice of a normal, happy and sad life of Cleo, and the people around her.

There’s so much to unpack in this, but what really stood out was the acting, direction, sound design and especially cinematography. Roma represents Cuarón at his best and most confident as a storyteller, and the intimacy of Roma is almost too hard to bear.

I do want to touch on the hospital scene, though. It’s the tensest I’ve been in the cinema in a long time, and it was all done in masterfully choreographed single-angle takes that ended up lasting well beyond several minutes. When I saw the liveless little baby body, I broke down, harder than I think I’ve ever done at a film. The brutality of seeing the doctors cover the child in the background while Cleo was still in her birthgiving position was too much to handle.

When she finally makes peace with herself at the beach, saying that she didn’t really want the child, and the family all hug her, it almost hit me even more than the hospital. The fact that she realised that she has more love from the family than she could ever need, and that she loves them just as much was the perfect wrap-up of such a beautiful character arc.

Roma is a masterpiece. I can’t wait to see it again. I had to call both my parents after seeing it. It reminds you (much like Children of Men) of what a precious gift life is, and that each one matters as much as the next one.  I guess its good that I saw on netflix and not in theaters cause I hate crying in public and walking around after crying. I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but it took a good 30-45 minutes for me to fall into rhythm with Roma. Saw it in theaters and by an hour in I was 100% with Cuarón. Definitely going to see it again, so I can let the movie and the longer scenes fully wash over me.

Also, as many have said, the sound design was exquisite. I thought people behind me were whispering. I turned around ready to shush them. It turned out to be the children in the movie whispering off-screen.  What an incredible work of art. For something relatively small-scale, it feels so *big.* Focusing on this little microcosm of characters living their lives against change and heartache gives it this gravitas that I can't quite pin down. Cuaron's direction is sublime, and the actors are so good it doesn't feel like they're acting.

That beach scene near the end. So powerful and cathartic. 

**Watch this movie with people you love.**  Honestly, that birth/dead birth scene is one of the biggest gut punches I have ever seen. Shot brilliantly in this one take and with so much emotion coming out of Yalitza Aparicio.

A neorealistic masterpiece ",1,Roma
29," I cooka da pizza Did anyone else feel it ended kind of abruptly/weirdly? The jump from the murder to the trial was a bit much I thought it was cartoonish, but fun. They should have called it *A Gucci Movie*. Maurizio smiled his way through the first two hours... LG and Pacino are easy noms for their categories

Leto… that’s a bit much pal. Thought he was gonna look to the camera and ask where da freakin’ gabagool was at one point What did everyone think of the accents?

I remember Salma Hayek talking about how she worked with a dialect coach who thought Lady Gaga sounded Russian. The irony to me is Salma Hayek sounded like… Salma Hayek. Laughed out loud at the cut when Leto is about to scream and we just hear his car horn instead. Between that and the sudden cut to Jeremy Irons dead in a casket the editor was clearly having fun just wilding out.

For most of the movie I was wondering why we were sitting through so many scenes with this ridiculous tarot card reader, then she ends up becoming a pivotal part of the plot. Kinda wish Scott cut a few of her scenes, though, this really didn't need to be 157 mins long. After seeing Leto's performance in this, it's clear the role of Mario in the Mario movie was miscast. So did Dominico steal Gucci from the family? It seems thats what the filmmakers want us to think. He seems to be the reason the father never signed the cert. he knew about the forgery. He took over the company No browns, no pastels. Is it possible for an actor to win an Oscar and a Razzie for the same role? Because I think that might apply for Leto here. I wish we got the movie the trailers promised. I enjoyed it, don't get me wrong, but the trailers promised more of a family takeover struggle/drama but instead it mostly glossed over and skipped between different events very quickly. It was more of...I guess a long sequence of short scenes. Good performances all around, interesting story (I wasn’t familiar with any Gucci history going into it), but definitely didn’t need a nearly 2 hour 40 minute runtime. Overall I enjoyed it. I bet it will do well at the box office. Anyone who liked this should watch All the Money in the World which has a lot of similarities including the same director. I enjoyed it, but there were a few parts I didn’t understand and I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me. 
 1. What was the significance of the man watching Adam Driver’s character in the very beginning of the movie? We see a man watching him from a car, and also from the riverbank when he’s on the boat. Who was that guy? 
2. I was confused about the unsigned will. Did Jeremy Irons’ character leave it unsigned on purpose, or was there some manipulation at play? And then later on, was this the same document that turned up with the forged signature? If so, the movie never explained who forged the signature right? Are we supposed to think Lady Gaga’s character did it? 
3. Why did the police raid Adam Driver’s house? I thought there were no more tax crimes to account for after Al Pacino got arrested? It seemed like Adam escaped to Switzerland to evade arrest, but later he returned and everything was fine, it seemed like nothing came of the police raid. The acting is what kept me watching for sure. I thought the story was kinda meh, and honestly a little boring, and they could have done the first hour in twenty minutes. However, the actors were all so on point that I couldn’t stop watching it. I think Leto the man is a piece of shit, but Leto the actor was tragically hilarious and very well performed. And Pacino, man was it nice to see subtle nuanced Pacino again, like The Godfather days. Driver was good, Gaga made me sick (in a good way). But ya, forgettable Oscar bait somewhat saved by fantastic performances. I have to be honest, when Marizio skied down the hill and saw Paola for the first time, I honestly thought it was Paolo wearing a fake nose and was extremely caught off guard to her being the new love interest. Best part was when Patrizia shows up at Maurizio's house, begging for him to come home. It was a heartbreaking scene but I felt both actors sold it very well. I wish they would have made it more obvious the passage of time, and what years/dates were happening when. For example, we see Aldo celebrating his 70th birthday, then two scenes later he’s celebrating it again, is that the following year? Hard to tell.

Honestly there was a missed opportunity with the use of music - I wish they would have used songs that were reflective of the actual year a scene is taking place in, instead of whatever random pop songs they chose.

I also ultimately don’t think Maurizio was anything more than a hen-pecked husband. Patrizia never had any real power or even fame or public devotion, she was just kind of - there. It seems like in the real life Gucci story, the family would have screwed up their business with or without her involvement. The real point of interest is the murder, which they spent very little time on.

Overall though the movie was entertaining, and everyone put out a great performance. I don’t think it will sweep Oscar gold, but there will probably be some nominations. Lady GaGa gives a convincing look at the depravity of the rich and famous. Scorsese should have directed this movie I really enjoyed this movie. Jared Leto's performance will be very polarizing, but I ate that shit up. My one big complaint is that they didn't show as much of the business side of Gucci as I was yearning for.

But its just a really entertaining movie. Definitely recommend seeing it. Going into this movie blind and then leaving the theater to find out Jared Leto played Paolo is a level of shock I’m not sure I’ll ever experience again I respect Ridley Scott for making the films he wants to make and it seems based off of this year’s sample size that he wants to make films where Adam Driver ***fucks*** I was getting serious Borat vibes from Paolo during the film. “He has my peaches in a very tight greep,” I mean this would sound right at home in a Borat movie. Watched this tonight and loved it. But I'm gonna need some external opinions to help clear up a discussion with my girlfriend.

We can't fully agree on the relationship between Maurizio and Patrizia. We do agree that Patrizia began as a gold digger (Points to her reaction to his name and then stalking him) but we then have varying opinions. 

Did she really fall in love with him? (Points to marrying him despite him having nothing at the time and them being happy without wealth) 

Or did she always see the potential for power and money and she trusted it would come back? (Points to the scenes with Pina and her kickstarting him going back to the Gucci family)

At the end, when she's at his house because of the divorce, was she crying and so on because she loved him or was it because she lost the power and wealth?

PS: Either way, despite her being the ""villain"", I did feel bad for her. What an amazing performance. ",0,House of Gucci
83," I liked it a lot. Banderas gave the best male performance of the year imo. His work did not feel like acting. To me, the story was a metaphor comparing heroin (a drug that destroys you inside while creating an unbreakable attachment, offering a numbing gratification like a child being comforted) to the over-attached bad mother who loves and gratifies, but still tries to destroy who her child is (his sexuality) The more I think about it the more I believe Banderas deserves Best Actor. My favorite film of the year. I was so moved by it, and the performances are wonderful. It looks so beautiful that it feels dreamlike, but there’s also an incredible sense of realism. Love this movie. In a just world, Banderas would win the Oscar. I just finished watching this and while I’m going to have to go back and rewatch it because I was a little inebriated during the first and part of the second act, I couldn’t agree more with everyone’s sentiments about Bandera’s performance. The pain he portrayed solely through his eyes in certain scenes... wow. Thank you to Pedro Almodóvar for writing such an introspective piece of film. [deleted] Watched this on Imovies for .99 cents. I was sad when it ended, because I wanted the movie to continue longer. There was a sense of naturalness and realism that was very pleasing. And the end shot where one is shown the artificial process of film making was unexpected, funny and a tribute to film's power.  Seamless joining of artifice and realism.  Almodovar is such a humane, skilled writer/director!  Banderas very good too. I rented it on Google Play! I'm in Canada though so I'm not certain how available it is in other countries. If it hasn't hit your city yet it's probably not going to play theatrically there at all. I can only speak for Atlanta but we got it all the way back at the beginning of November. You should definitely rent it though, it's really great and probably my favorite Almodovar. ",0,Pain and Glory
98," Im not sure if anyone noticed. But  I liked the parallels of when they first sent him in to see if the black panther guy was going to cause violence  and didnt believe him about them not really being violent. But when he started going at the kkk, the organization, they kept dismissing how violent they would get and they end up trying to blow people up. Damn, that was heavy. Had me on edge the whole time! Powerful cinematography. One moment that stood out was the face portraits during the BSU speech towards the beginning.

I would watch it again, for sure. Tonight Spike Lee had us in the theater applaud Topher Grace performance as David Duke cause he felt he channeled Duke perfectly and gave a fantastic performance that isn’t getting enough credit. 

And he brought up how he knew John David Washington was perfect to cast cause he’s seen him in other things but also cause he’s Denzel’s son. He’s also one of the kids in the end of Malcolm X.  John David Washington has his father’s exact gait. I don’t know how else to describe it other than “sinking in to a strut.” Also i think Adam Driver is one of the best young/modern actors. His monologue about “I never thought about it before, but now it’s all I think about.” Was so great, I think he’s the most natural actor around.

This felt like a beautiful mesh between older Do The Right Thing, Malcom X, Crooklyn Spike Lee and later career Inside Man, 25th Hour Spike Lee. It was messy but it was a lot of fun.  TIL Steve Buscemi has an actor brother!  ALEC BALDWIN LOL  Adam Driver played a jewish man playing a black man playing a racist white man. 

What a time to be alive. John D Washington (aka Ricky Jarret) and Adam Driver were both great in this movie.  Also Topher Grace pulled off David Duke pretty well.  Whoever played Felix also did a great job of portraying a terrible human, good job by him. I just got out of this film watching in Downtown Charlottesville. Needless to say, the ending was incredibly powerful sitting in the theatre that is a couple of blocks away from Market Street Park (formerly Emancipation Park, formerly Lee Park) and only a few more blocks from 4th Street. I think Spike Lee made his message clear and maybe some think it is over done. But I think he wants it to be **as clear as humanly possible**. White nationalism is not dead, nor is it non-violent. In an attempt to illustrate that the effort of people like Stallworth, he shows that while these people experienced some level of success, these problems are not solved like many seem to think they are.  How are you going to cast Sicilian ass Nicholas Turturro as a member of the KKK?   The lie detectors scene genuinely might be the funniest scene I’ve ever seen.

“You want to see my big Jew dick you fag?”

“You think it was fake? I think it makes perfect sense.”

Overall hilarious and incredibly relevant movie. Loved every second. Fight almost broke out in my theater when the credits came up and a man yelled “Fuck Trump” which caught the attention of a few Trump supporters in the crowd.

A movie that provocative deserves some praise. “Why don’t you come to Louisiana and see how we play?”
I was ready for Ron to lose it at that point. Sheeeeeeeeeatttttt. This was great! Such a well-directed film. You can really feel Spike Lee’s intentions in every scene. The fact that this was released on the anniversary of the events in Charlottesville is a pretty ballsy move, too.

Oh, and Shaft is better than Superfly. No competition there. [deleted] I loved how Spike does not let you get away with just enjoying the silly cop movie about some silly cop shit that happened in the 70s.  Yeah, these guys are ridiculous, but you get a couple true believers in there and they become extremely dangerous.  

What a great and important movie, everyone should see it. Anyone think Jasper Pääkkönen (Felix) deserves high credit for playing a sleazy white supremacist when he's a Finnish dude? Someone give Topher grace a hug or something this sort  of role must be taxing   Fucking LOVED the last phone call with David Duke. ""Are uh, you sure about that?"" One of the funniest moments in the movie for me, and good thing too because I needed a laugh at the end of that.  I saw this film tonight at a theater here in Louisiana. After the ""Why don't you come down to Louisiana and see how we play?"" line, someone in the audience shouted ""Yeah!"" I felt sick.

It's so sickening to know that David Duke recently ran for office here and people actually voted for him. It was really rough to hear all of the Louisiana references.  The whole white power/black power scene was enthralling, had the same simmering tension as the 25th Hour rant. Shout out to the composer, a Spike Lee film wouldn’t feel like one without his music. When they were naming their black heros and they mention OJ as the their biggest influence, figuratively killed me out of laughter. Really showed how like able he was at the time.  The real life Ron Stallworth doesn’t feel that racism has changed since the days he infiltrated the KKK. 

 ""Let me put it this way, it hasn't changed,"" he told NPR. ""To me, race is the single most divisive factor affecting American society. It's an issue that we are afraid of, that we shy away from; and quite frankly, it amuses me that we are so sensitive to the issue."" I thought my theater was quiet during A Quiet Place but I was wrong. The ending of this movie beat that silence by a mile  ",1,Blackkklansman
