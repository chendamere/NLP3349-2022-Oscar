0," The final shot adjusting for the horizon was brilliant The praying scene with the Christian girlfriend had the crowd howling with laughter. One of the funniest scenes I've seen in a theater.

Also, the entire cast did a great job but Gabriel Labelle was phenomenal in this. Talk about an uncomfortable movie, yes it ends on a optimistic note.. but at it’s core, this is essentially about watching the slow disintegration of a family. Towards the end, you start to wonder if Spielberg’s obsession with movies may in fact be his coping mechanism. It’s corny but I feel like I understand his work a bit better.

It certainly re-contextualizes *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, for me. I used to wonder why Richard Dreyfuss bails on his family. Now after Fablemans I kinda see why. Spielberg’s iffy view towards families is a lot more understandable to me.

Even Sammy’s mom reminded me of Robin Williams character in *Hook* at times. I think it’s time to go through the filmography again.

Also David Lynch man… stole the whole show. No one is going to talk about Speilberg's roast to the bully about ""never telling anyone about this.... unless he makes a movie about it"" lol What I really love about this movie is that it doesn't really feel like a movie about ""the power of cinema"" or how sitting in the movie theater transports us to a place where we can forget our lives. Sam's life is never really out of focus once he hits adolescence. Even when watching Liberty Valence, his friends and their jokes surround him, and he is thinking about how he will make his next project. Almost every scene where he screens one of his films, he has some other personal problems overshadowing his moments of supposed glory. But he still notices how good the reception is, and so he keeps investing in himself and his talent, into the only thing he can truly control at this age: that he can direct the hell out of a movie. 

I had a very profound moment in high school, where for the first time I realized I was actually good at something. It's one of the more empowering moments of my life. And that's where I connected with this movie. I love being good at what I love, and I'm so glad Spielberg still loves what he does, because he is *so fucking good at it.* I really enjoyed how the conflict between Sammy and his bully was resolved in the hallway after prom. With the beach film, Sammy ended up elevating his bully to look like someone who is way cooler than who he was in reality (which even results in the bully's girlfriend forgiving him). And yet, the bully's ego ended up getting completely shattered, and he got humbled big time because Sammy's film ended up making him feel totally inadequate. 

Funny thing is, I believe Sammy when he said he didn't even do anything intentionally or put a whole lot of thought into what he filmed. It's just like in real life, how films and art often end up taking a life of their own beyond the creator's initial intentions. 

Also, surprise David Lynch! I really liked this movie. The John Ford scene had me rolling at the end Judd Hirsch stole the show. I was disappointed that he didn’t return at the end. Spielberg movies has such a comfort and warmth to them, no matter what genre he does theres always that feeling. I hope this isnt his last film, but if it is, what a way to go out! This movie hurt me so badly and I loved every second of it. The saddest thing is Seth Rogen buying Sam the top of the line 8mm camera and then it never gets used. This was an incredible movie to film, I had a very small role in it but just to put in some perspective, we filmed for an entire month, a lot of the scenes the group of us were in were probably cut and I hope they make it into the extra scenes on the blu ray,  Mr Spielberg is incredible and a dream come true to be directed by him.  I have seen the film 6 times already

[Gustavo Escobar (sal)](https://www.instagram.com/thegustavoescobar/) Did anyone get sucked into that WWII film? The last Spielberg and John Williams Collaboration I like the scene of the mom dancing at the campfire where she is basically between the dad and the best friend with both starring when the other looks away then they both look on in awe . Sammy just amazed by the shot while the sister understands the situation for what it is and tho still young knows something is off Only me and some other dude laughed at the Goldwater mention. Really enjoyed this. I don’t think it’s a film for everyone. You definitely have to either be a fan or appreciate “movie magic”. 

The score was amazing. Dano and Williams were at the top of their games. The scene where he is editing the camping trip and founds out about his mother and uncle was probably my favorite scene. Just so well crafted and built up to that moment. As a child of divorced parents who remained friends for my sake, well this hit read hard. Explain a lot why it’s such a reoccurring themes in his movies. The entire cast was pitch perfect but Seth Rogen as Bennie really blew me away. I hope we see more roles like this from him in the future. Before: ""I hate California, it sucks here and I hate you for moving us here!""

After girlfriend: ""You know what, California is a pretty nice place after all"" Although I struggled to stay engaged during the beginning, once the weird uncle made his cameo and Sammy discovered his mom’s dirty little secret, I became hooked. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about this film since I left the theater last night, it’s easily my second favorite film of 2022 behind Everything Everywhere All At Once (and I still got Glass Onion, Babylon and Avatar left). I would see it again but unfortunately, I don’t have anyone in my life that’d be convinced to watch this in a theatrical setting, so I’d have to wait until it hits streaming Poor Burt, man. Just wanted to do right by his family. After 15 minutes, I thought we were in for it—the kid wasn't working for me, the ""movies are dreams"" line landed at a bad angle, it seemed Spielberg was Spielberging HARD. Two hours later, I didn't want the movie to end. It had evolved into something emotionally complex and deeply considered, winning and bittersweet. It's not perfect, but it's real. He's done it again. Calling it now, Senor Spielbergo is going to win his 3rd Best Director Oscar this year. Mitzy: ~~Caught in 4K~~8mm Spielberg knows how to move the camera. Confirmed.
Beautiful film. ",0,The Fabelmans
1," [Just FYI, Ke Huy Quan graced us with an AMA for this movie today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/tyiir8/hi_im_ke_huy_quan_one_of_the_stars_of_everything/) Due to limited sticky space in the sub we had to unsticky it, but I figured this would be a a good place to advertise it. I think I just watched the real Multiverse of Madness IRS has a secret sex dungeon. I like how this movie about the infinite power of the multiverse takes place almost entirely in an IRS building, too.

What a hell of an achievement. I’m floored by this film and I’m going to need to see it several more times.

Hey, Hollywood, please cast Ke Huy Quan in everything, everywhere all at once. One detail my friend picked up that I really liked was when Michelle Yeoh put the googly eye on her forehead, the colors were direct opposites to the everything bagel (white circle encircling a small black circle vs a black bagel with a white bagel hole).

It was a neat way of representing how, despite Evelyn being awakened to the multiverses, she decides that no, things exist that do matter. She has an optimistic outlook instead of Jobu’s nihilistic one. Despite having the same experiences, she rejects Jobu’s philosophy and finds meaning in her family. Finally a movie which recognizes that the concept of an ""everything bagle"" is a lovecraftian nightmare. There’s so many good things to discuss: the incredible visuals, how genuinely surreal and funny it is, the way everything comes together despite juggling multiple threads, but I wanted to say this movie emotionally wrecked me in a way I was not expecting. 

I grew up a second generation Asian immigrant. My mother is like Evelyn, driven but harsh and cold. Rarely have I heard my mother give affection and much of it is guarded by discipline (my mom, too, has commented on my appearance when she doesn’t know what to say like Evelyn does with Joy’s weight). She seems disappointed by her career path, the husband she’s chosen, her children. She has a job she hates to keep the family afloat, but I know she had dreams of being a writer or an artist. She’s engulfed in shame. 

I felt almost 1:1 with Joy. I grew up with pressure from my parents do what was “right” and I always felt like a mess. I was closeted bisexual and transgender and felt like I wasn’t worthy of being myself. I had a career path that made me miserable and I dropped out of college because of depression. My parents were not pleased. I felt crazy in my family because none of these ambiguous pressures that controlled us mattered. My mother would tell me to go back to school, to go into my original career path and I’d think “why? Why does any of this matter?”. I could only imagine myself miserable, chained to the expectations of others. With some therapy and soul searching I realized that nothing mattering is a GOOD thing, that I can start to take control of my life again and do the things I wanted and be the person who I knew I was. Even as a failure, a college dropout, I deserved to be true to myself. I felt like I was set free. I went back to school, this time with a career path I wanted despite being risky. I came out to my parents, I started being myself. 

I look at my mom and I desperately want her to see what I see, to realize none of the pressures she puts on herself matter. For her to be free of what others think, but most of all to be free from her disappointment in herself. For her to trust other people, to feel proud of who she is. When Waymond tells Evelyn that she is the worst version of herself, I feel my mothers shame. But even the “worst version” of herself has the potential to take control of her life, to do the things she wants to do, and deserves to be loved. I feel like my mother has always laser focused on specific tasks because she fears the big picture. As if looking at her whole life, she’ll realize she’s lost sight of who she is. She floods herself with work and stress because the alternative is too painful. She thinks it’s too late to be who she wants to be, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. My relationship with my mother is still strained and our conversations shallow. She doesn’t open up and then wonders why I don’t feel connected to her. The truth is having her love herself and be honest would be the best thing for both of us. To accept the person she is, and to move past her shame and disappointment to see the incredible things she has done for both her family and for herself. To realize her dreams are hers to take, and realize not achieving them wouldn't mean failure. For her to see the person I see, a stubborn, perfectionist, workaholic who overwhelms herself by placing passion in too many places. A loving family member who frustrates me because she doesn’t know how to express it. My mom who, despite our struggles, I feel privileged to love in the short time I have. 


I was sobbing through the final third of the movie. When Evelyn said her daughter was a mess, and that it’s okay because she is a mess too, I felt it in my soul. All I’ve wanted is for my mother to admit she doesn’t have it all together, but it's okay because of the love we have for eachother.

I have waited all my life for a movie like this to find me. This is the most creative and imaginative movie I've seen in a long time. Daniel S. casting himself as the guy who has Michelle Yeoh as his dominatrix is the most inspired casting since Tarantino was cast as the guy who sucked on Salma Hayek’s feet in *From Dusk Till Dawn*. My favorite part of this movie was easily when Evelyn and her multiversal counterparts start screaming... And her URN from the alpha universe opened up and screamed too 😂 I think this might be the best film I’ll see this year. I don’t know what could top that experience. The last 30 minutes was just me laughing my ass off, crying profusely, and being in awe of the raw emotion that they managed to bring out of something so crazy. It’s just overwhelming with its pure sincerity and heart. 

And on top of that is a fucking badass action movie. Some seriously cool bits of Wuxia and kung fu movie influence. Like Waymond wailing on the security guards with his Fanny pack. Or the entire office fight with the shield spinning. Or the totally bonkers Butt Plug fight. 

Yet in a movie with literally everything bagels, mech suit James Hong, a raccoon piloting Harry Shum , Jenny Slate using a dog as a mentor hammer, a heart felt lesbian love story with hotdog fingers, talking rocks, and pinky kung fu there is a very sweet and powerful message at its heart. And the day is saved by a plea for kindness. Holy shit does Ke Huy Quan have the best moments of this movie. As amazing as Michelle Yeoh and Stephanie Hsu are, Waymond is the heart of this thing and it knows it. 

I can’t fucking wait to watch it again. Just on a single viewing I caught so many awesome moments that were set up and payed off later. I’m sure I missed some. I waited a long time to see the Daniels follow up their Farting Corpse Movie that made me cry. Boy did they top it. 

Also, Ke Huy Quan giving off some BIG “In The Mood For Love” vibes in the “Movie Star” universe. An absolutely incredible movie. I was blown away at how it was as touching and heartfelt and honest as it was absurd. Brilliant performances from all the major players. Everyone’s going to be talking about Ke Huy Quan’s “this is how I fight” monologue as the one that got away, or emotional climax of Michelle Yeoh tearfully telling Stephanie Hsu that on a cosmic level across all scenarios there is no way she wouldn’t still be there for her daughter.

One thing I want to highlight is the use of language to show the disconnects between characters; James Hong speaks in Cantonese the entire movie, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan mostly speak Mandarin throughout, and Stephanie Hsu’s Chinese is extremely broken and a struggle to even get a couple words out. They’re all literally not speaking the same language. When Michelle Yeoh speaks Chinese in the emotional height of the movie in the laundromat parking lot she speaks in her much more fluent Cantonese and the performance is just so beautiful.

I can’t wait to see this again and I wish it was playing in more theatres! I don’t know if anyone has brought this up but I’m chilling in bed high af as I had this epiphany. In order to change realities, you have to do something unpredictable before shifting to another reality. It’s symbolizing how in order to make change in your life, you have to do something out of routine, something that breaks the cycle of your actions that result to where you are now Good God. Coming out of this movie felt like I had just come out of a year's worth of therapy. I found myself laughing till I was crying, crying till I was laughing at how utterly bizzare and absurd and slammed by the sentimentality and portrayal of intergenerational trauma. This movie hit home for me. Yeoh and Quans performance were absolute highlights. There were so many moments in which I found myself at the edge of my seat, this truly has been the best movie I've seen since the pandemic started.

The attention to detail is amazing, from the chinglish, to the Chinese (genderless) pronoun conversation, to Evelyn switching from Canto to speaking to her father, mandarin when speaking to her husband, and then English to joy.... This truly was a labor of love. Worth every penny I spent on my ticket and I plan to rewatch it again in theaters. Maybe one of my favorite movies ever. Just had my complete attention from start to finish. It starts out a bit 'what is happening' but then just has a chokehold on you for the next 2 hours. 

The initial rock scene was so fucking good. And I can't believe they developed the Racacoonie spinoff fully. I can't even explain my favourite parts because it was all so good. I've never had a movie be so equal parts absolute hearty laughter mixed with incredible emotion. 

Stephanie Hsu was absolutely the scene stealer. I think the movie really got going when she showed up as Jobu for the first time in that hallway fight. I was like ""okay now I'm REALLY on board"" 

I'll be thinking of this movie for a long long time One thing I really loved about the film was Evelyn’s arc where she starts off pining for all the lost possibilities, but eventually learns to fight for what she has. The idea that it may have been close to the worst life she could’ve lived, but it’s worth fighting for all the same was genuinely uplifting. My favorite part:

\----

You think I'm weak, don't you? All of those years ago when we first fell in love, your father would say I was too sweet for my own good. Maybe he was right.

>Please! Please, can we just stop fighting?

You tell me that it's a cruel world and we're all just running around in circles. I know that. I've been on this earth just as many days as you.

>I know you're all fighting because you're scared and confused. I'm confused too. All day. I don't know what the heck is going on, but somehow this feels like it's all my fault.

When I choose to see the good side of things, I'm not being naive. It is strategic and necessary. It's how I've learned to survive through everything.

>I don't know. The only thing I do know is that we have to be kind. Please, be kind. Especially when we don't know what's going on.

I know you see yourself as a fighter. Well, I see myself as one too. This is how I fight. Can we talk about how Waymond quotes the song Absolutely (Story of a Girl) to Evelyn and then the song pops up multiple times in different versions throughout? Because when we cut back to the sex dungeon, there’s a version of the song that changes the lyrics to “my safeword’s ‘smile’” and it fucking killed me. There is so much praise to heap upon this movie but I just want to say that I was laughing out loud in the emptying theatre as the credits rolled because Jamie Lee Curtis' character's full name is Deirdre Beaubeirdra. Reject Nihilism. Embrace absurdity. Discover purpose. 

Just incredible. “In another Universe, I would have loved to do laundry and taxes with you “ 

KILL ME 😭😭😭😭😭😭 I know there has to be *one* person who immediately dips during the fake out ending and I find that hilarious.

Right when the credits came up I immediately thought of *The Simpsons Movie*. I’m a Chinese American woman, pregnant with my first child. This movie hit me like a ton of bricks. I’m crying right now just remembering the movie. 

I saw so much of my parents in Evelyn and Waymond. I saw so much of myself in Evelyn and Joy. 

Also, Raccacoonie. That is all. Loved this movie. The 2001 ape hot dog fingers scene had me rolling. Great use of chekhov's ~~gun~~ butt plug. Stephanie Hsu was awesome in this movie. She pulled off the comedic scenes so well and she aced the scenes that required emotional vulnerability. I read that Awkwafina was initially casted as Joy and I'm not sure she could've done a better job than Hsu. Her character was perfectly casted ",0,Babylon
2," A favorite detail of mine from a musician's perspective - 

In the final scene with the Monster Hunter: World concert, she is given headphones. Those headphones would play her a metronome or a ""click track,"" basically a computerized and predetermined tempo map that allows the orchestra to synchronize with the videos on the screen behind the orchestra. 

She tells everyone in the first interview scene that the thing that she views as her ultimate source of power as a conductor is her power to manipulate time through tempo.

So on top of her perceived humiliation of conducting a concert like this, by giving her that click track, she is also completely stripped of her power as a conductor to put her own spin or take on the music - even the most basic power to stop and start the piece - and is instead totally beholden to the headphones and the metronome. 

It's an awesome way to end the movie. That oner in the classroom was breathtaking. Can't imagine being the guy playing the student going 1on1 with Blanchett for that long of a scene. Those leg shakes were probably real lol Hilarious and haunting. There's a real beguiling quality to this film - it's a character study and yet it manages to touch on so many grand and complex themes while being so singularly focussed. Power, obsession, identity politics, image/persona, the transcendent qualities of art, passion, the list could go on. 

The classroom scene in the first act really seems to put a context around the rest of the film. Can the merits of a piece of art be separated from the creator? Are they inextricable? Is it an act of ego to dismiss something because we take offence? Do we deny ourselves of something valuable when we moralize art and the artist? Lydia Tar certainly seems to think so. She admonishes her student for letting his ego get in the way of perfecting his craft. She asks him something along the lines of ""On what basis would you like those filling out your rating cards judge you?"" The implied answer being, simply on my skill. 

For me personally, this conversation lingers over the rest of the movie. Particularly when we see Lydia herself clock the footwear of a pretty young student in a blatant violation of the blind audition process. We see her adjust her scorecard accordingly, and in that moment, we know she's a hypocrite. 

What follows are deleted emails, surprise auditions, lunches, trips abroad, all a series of plausibly deniable acts of manipulation. I love the pacing and structure of this film, it's like watching a beautiful and intricate house of cards slowly rattle, then shake, then collapse with astonishing speed. 

The direction and writing are equal parts magnificent. This movie feels like the lovechild of Aaron Sorkin and Pablo Larraín in the best way possible. I love the looming spectre of Lydia's past that haunts this movie. There are several scenes that feel directly ripped from the most suspenseful horror film. That slow unwinding of a legacy, a career, and a woman herself creates a beautiful tension throughout the runtime. It all culminates in what I found to be a poignant, sad, somehow both pitiful and admirable, and above all darkly and deeply hilarious closing note. 

It doesn't really need to be said but Cate Blanchett is of course an absolute powerhouse on the screen. I look forward to revisiting this one again and seeing what more I take away from it. Apartment for Sale better get an Oscar nomination for original song. Also, really liked how well the movie conveyed how much control she had over everything, how invincible she felt from any problems, and how everything came crashing down. She has everyone on a string from the jump, set up well by the resume reading at the beginning that shows how important she is, but she views people as chess pieces not unlike an orchestra member where she is using them to try and get a specific sound. 

While we never saw exactly what happened with her previous student who committed suicide, we see a similar story playing out with the cellist during the film that helps give us insight. I love the movie but I found the scene most revealing to be the brief encounter with her brother back home. he calls her Linda and then corrected himself but I think that the combination of the meagre surroundings and his accent means that she worked very hard to reinvent herself severely in many ways.  that was my favourite scene from the movie as brief as it was. And she never really met “Lenny” except on the television, did she? She meticulously catalogued every episode. 

But I think she probably never met him. I saw this last weekend and really loved it. I feel like there are so many surreal elements just peaking in from the edges of this film that bear a repeat viewing. What was the symbolism of the weird maze drawings and who was leaving them everywhere? What was the meaning of her dream where she was in the bed on fire in the middle of a lake? What the fuck was up with the derelict building where she was searching for the Russian cellist girl? Did anyone else see a straight up ghost just out of frame when she first went to her small apartment or was that just me? Also someone pointed out to me that the lineup of girls she’s shown in the massage place are arranged  in a half circle similarly to an orchestra. Her reaction to seeing them makes me wonder though, does the movie leave any room for us to give Lydia the benefit of the doubt? We see her doing some highly suspicious things but the movie never explicitly shows her engaging in the big crimes that she’s accused of. The emails and her efforts to hide them are the biggest proof that she’s abusing her power but it’s interesting to me that we don’t ever see her interactions with the girl who killed herself and we never see her make any explicit sexual advances on anyone. I love when a movie has me ask questions I'm still trying to answer days later. Phenomenal. Whatever the opposite of spinning is, Kubrick's doing it in his grave. Found it interesting how the movie started with slower, longer shot talky scenes, mainly of Tar controlling the conversations. And as the film progressed and Tar's life started falling apart, it got more fast paced, quickly cutting from scene to scene. Me watching the opening credits: Heh, there's a ""special thanks"" to Monster Hunter: World. I wonder why

Me 2.5 hours later: HOLY FUCK The first 30 minutes do a lot to drill into the audience just how in control Lydia is over everything and everyone in her life. 

The scene with her estranged brother towards the end filled in a lot of gaps I had and helped to humanize her. I’m sure we’ve all felt like running away at some point in our lives. I was thoroughly riveted from start to finish – the film never misses a beat.  Some of my thoughts and takeaways:

1. What's fascinating in the portrayal of cancel culture is how Lydia is condemned for both superficial and serious reasons, and how the line between these can so deceptively be blurred.  What's the moral distance between offending a minority student and sexually harassing a subordinate?  Between sexually harassing a subordinate and driving one to suicide?  At what point along the spectrum of social transgression does the artist become unworthy of art, and are we confident enough in our own self-purity to be the ones who make that decision?  Is there any talent great enough that it is immune to such rules, any art that can hold its glory without the artist?  I found it thrilling to watch such a serious movie about topics that are discussed in such a frequently superficial manner, and I'm still trying to unpack what the answers might be.
2. In the opening interview I was amused at how the audience raises scorn at the briefest mentions of ""Kavanaugh"" and ""Mel Brooks"".  The message is clear in this moment – such people are not accepted in good society, are considered jokes at best and dangers at worst, and are understood to have *always* been that way.  It doesn't matter if Mel Brooks was an EGOT in the past, so long as he's been canceled now.  I think it's possible that Lydia fears even then that she might join their ranks, which is why she spends a good deal of time criticizing the worldview that would strip a person of their reputation on the basis of social sins.  This is also just a small example of how controlled the script is despite featuring so many long scenes of seemingly obscure conversation.
3. Tár is a distinctly masculine character, from her domineering personality to her capitalist worldview, her power-driven abuses of power and her narcissistic, cerebral rants.  She also refers to herself in German as Petra's ""father"", scoffs at the feminine usage of ""maestra"", and blithely claims to have never faced discrimination on the basis of sex.  At a certain point it becomes a sleight of hand in and of itself to depict Tár as a woman – it lowers our defenses, makes her more interesting and causes us to even admire her, despite her displaying all the typical hallmarks of arrogant, abusing, and powerful men.  If Tár were not a woman we might never consider, as the film wants us to, whether her punishment is just and her downfall inevitable.
4. Nina Hoss's character is really amazing and intricate, and I really hope she gets the awards attention she deserves alongside Blanchett. I’m not smart enough to talk about anything to deep with confidence but the “Apartment for sale” song with the accordion was so funny to me . It was like her mask off moment where she just lost it 😂 still thinking about Nina Hoss' facial expressions — she did so much with every shot, it had me waiting for the camera to be turned back to her. its no slight thing to go up against blanchett and in such an understated way The beginning field recording that plays as the credits roll before we meet Lydia Tár, is a Shipibo-Conibo shaman from Peru. Lydia Tár is also an ethnomusicologist who studied this group. Cate Blanchett said in an interview that Lydia has certainly taken ayahuasca many times. Apparently, she didn't take enough to experience ""ego death.""

We can also see Peru influence in her flat. There is a black & white photograph of Lydia with the shaman's design drawn on her face and smoke around her. We see a clip of this also in one of the trailers. The maze some of you have mentioned is a fractal design, likely inspired by the Shipibo-Conibo spiritual beliefs.  Lydia, Krista, and Francesca went to the Peru together so they all must know how to draw them.

Lydia also has a ritual of lighting the candles. It appears to be a cleansing ritual. She does the same thing while waiting to go on stage. We also see Lydia mention the Hebrew word kavanah, intention, in the interview. Later she is shown doing permutation of Krista's name to be AT RISK. We observe that her assistant did the same thing to her name as RAT.

I think Lydia begins to experience auditory and visual hallucinations from insomnia. She can't face her emotions and her complicity in not taking Krista's suicidality seriously. The blood-curdling screams when she is running... The growling black shepherd she runs away from and trips face-first into the concrete. The ghostly figure.... It's all unsettling.

Todd Field shared that Lydia Tár suffers from misophonia and misokinesia. She experiences emotional distress that usually includes anger, when she is exposed to certain triggering sounds & sights under conditions that she lacks control over them. It's partially why she is so anxious before the interview and why she so frustrated by Max's bouncing leg and the clicking of the pen. Lydia is stealing her wife's beta-blockers to calm down because she won't admit she needs treatment.

Todd Field also said Lydia grew up with deaf parents which adds another interesting element to her quirks. We see an awfully contorted angry face in one of the trailers I assumed to be Lydia's mother. People do not just run away and cut ties with their families of origin when they have had happy lives. Lydia Tár left behind Linda Tarr who adored Leonard Bernstein and recorded all his appearances on VHS, and fought her way into the classical music world. Leonard Bernstein had mentored her? Not exactly. Lydia finessed her backstory so she could fit in with the upper echelons of the classical music world. 

The ending was fantastic. I absolutely loved it. Lydia said another female conductor has been forced to be a ""dog show"" as a guest conductor? It was snotty remark by Lydia. So it was only fitting that she would end up a guest conductor   forced to follow a click track at a cosplay concert. Krista had been forced into the role of a youth conductor because Lydia had blacklisted her to all the major orchestras. Well, it looks like Lydia received the same blacklisting, but one that was well-deserved for her bad behavior. I liked it a whole lot. I got a kick out of Lydia casually tossing off a reference to Jabberwocky (""She'll come galumphing back"") not realizing, considering the context in the poem, what that implied for her.

And I don't really know why, but the cellist flying down the stairs in exultation with her instrument on her back is one of my favorite shots of the year. Best movie of the year so far. I love how it uses perspective to tell a MeToo/“cancel culture” story about the abuser rather than the victim — particularly, one who thinks she’s the victim. We spend the entire time as an audience squarely in Lydia Tár’s world, so the only times we’re made to realize her transgressions are the rare times she herself is forced to confront them - when Sebastian confronts her, when she drives by protestors, when she has to do a deposition. Her abuse and corruption is not portrayed as sexual, as it might be if we saw this story from Krista’s perspective, but as measured and appropriate - which makes it all the more sinister when we see those moments. Field shows us how ego and power convince people that their actions are good. We start the film entirely bought into the image of Tár, but slowly lose faith in her and by the time the final image is onscreen, we see her for who she truly is. What was the significance of Knut marking the music sheet after Lydia gets escorted out during the performance? Where the hell does Olga live? Or was that another quasi hallucination? I saw this its opening week at Lincoln Square. I went in practically blind... just knowing Blanchett was a composer.

And I loved it!

The movie did a pretty good job of presenting Tar an untouchable folk hero in the beginning, slowly breaking down her aura and then deservedly dunking all over her in the end. She was a quite unlikable character who got what was coming to her

That final shot was magnificent. 

One of the best of the year... 10/10 “Do you eat fish?” I'll admit, I honestly wasn't feeling this for the first hour or so, but once the reveal that the former student she preyed on died by suicide, things started to move at quite a brisk pace and I began to understand what the movie was about. Seeing Tár's perfect, controlled life begin to fall apart became a lot more poignant when you spent a whole hour getting used to it.

While I'd still list this off more as a ""performance"" movie (for real, at this point it'd be a *crime* for Blanchett to not get best actress this year), there's still loads of unexpected depth I genuinely wasn't expecting throughout the movie, so much so that I don't think it's possible to fully grasp all of what the film is doing in one viewing.

While I'm not sure if I'll **love** this movie like most critics have, I'll absolutely be giving it another watch later on. This needs more than one screening to fully appreciate, as there's so much else going on underneath the surface than just a simple ""cancel culture"" movie. Why was Tár's assistant terrorizing her with the maze drawings? Was it a way of holding power over her in the uneven relationship? Blanchett was amazing (no surprise). I really loved the running theme of image making, especially when Adam Gopnik’s recap of Lydia’s resume is juxtaposed with the selection of her outfit and album cover to reflect the giants of her field. I loved the descent from her high position is slowly became more blue collar . Valet cars became taxis , beautiful board meetings turned into casual friday wear with rolled up sleeves , even her carrying her own Luggage. Then you finally meet her brother and realize what she’s running from yet him being “Working class” was the least judgmental . “None of my business” ",0,Tar
3," “What pay outs John?” was strictly made for the trailer because the wife acted her butt off for that one line and was 😶 the rest of the scene lol Does anyone who knows the backstory or read the book know why Harvey was so obsessed with whether Gwyneth Paltrow was a source? Was it because she was the biggest star he knew they had spoken to? (Bigger, at least, than Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan were at the time) I enjoyed this.  The moment where Ashley says that she will go on record and the reporter bursts into tears got me.  Samantha Morton was very powerful in her scene.  I really liked some of the cinematography, particularly their usage of the big red cafeteria space.

My critiques: 

-the voice actress they got for Rose McGowan sounded nothing like her.  Then came the scene where Gwyneth is on the phone and it sounded exactly like her, which made me question if they got her to do it (they did!).  They must’ve asked Rose and she declined.  She’s justifiably angry over not being believed for years. 

-I wish I’d gotten to know the reporters a bit more.  I just saw the movie two hours ago and I cannot remember their names.  They aren’t very memorably played.  It’s just a montage of them answering phones while their husbands are just kinda there.  Each survivor blows the reporters off the screen.

-would a reporter really rock up to a house and spill the beans about a woman’s rape to her husband?  Yeesh! 

EDIT: FUCK LISA BLOOM. Samantha Morton was amazing This film does a lot pretty well, in its own stripped-down way. It's never salacious and allowing Harvey Weinstein to hang over everything like an omniscient/omnipresent spectre (rather than he being a main character ala Roger Ailes in *Bombshell)* is pretty effective.

A good watch for anyone interested in journalism or the *#MeToo* era. A lot of people are calling this film a weaker version of Spotlight but I think it's a stronger version of Bombshell.

One of my [criticisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ed3giv/comment/fbwf2fq) of Bombshell was the fact that it was written and directed by men. I think that detachment from the female characters and their experiences caused them to focus on the assaults.

But instead of making a spectacle or sensation of the heinous acts, Maria Schrader and Rebecca Lenkiewicz wisely put the emphasis on the trauma and subsequent resilience. For me, this is what elevates it from your typical scandal or journalism procedural. As rough as it may be, I think this should be required viewing in schools when discussing sexual harassment. Journalist here. I see a lot of folks calling this movie ‘bland.’ That’s probably accurate and intentional.  Even the color palette felt bland. But journalism can be tedious and frustrating.  This shows how mainstream media really works to verify, corroborate and confirm. Some great acting but I dont think it did a good enough job of differentiating the different women interviewed or explain the journalistic process. They kept talking about ""going on the record"" without explaining what exactly that means or what happens if they don't get it. Yeah, I thought it was OK. I feel like this kind of story would have been told better as a documentary rather than a dramatization. Solid movie, well acted, but some of the dialogue in the first half of the movie sounded like someone (poorly) trained an AI to write dialogue about How Journalism Works. Just didn't sound like how humans actually talk, and it really took me out of the movie for a bit.

Once they started talking to some of the women Weinstein abused, the quality of the writing improved significantly.

Largely agree with the general tone of the reviews - they made a good movie out of a great story. I quite liked it. Seems like a lot of people in this thread wanted more drama or mystery or whatever, but I don’t think that would have been the better movie. I thought they did a good job of making the story engaging, and the acting easily provided anything that was missing. 

The acting really was phenomenal. I already loved Mulligan, but wasn’t familiar with Kazan, and those two were great together. I loved how Kazan was generally pretty calm and collected, and Mulligan was pacing all over the place during phone calls. It wasn’t a funny movie but almost exclusively whenever I laughed it was a scene between those two. 
Special mention for:

>	You do it. You’re less intimidating
>> You don’t think I’m intimidating??

I was so entranced in the real audio tape scene. I loved the background of the empty hotel hallways. It worked so well, and gave it an extra eeriness to it. Also, the red drop shadow to the subtitles really added to that as well.

I thought the music was used well here too. I mean it wasn’t *exceptional* by any means, but it did really help in the dramatic scenes, especially towards the end. 

I think a framing device could have been a bit better. I guess I’m in the minority when I say that I enjoyed all the phone calls. Especially loved how it was almost always one sided with us not seeing the face of whomever was on the other line. Perhaps if they had a non-linear  jump-forwards to the editing room when they were putting it all together with each phone all being a flashback to how they got whatever information they were publishing it could have brought the story together a little bit better, but the linear way they ended up doing it portrayed how it was a developing story. 

Also shout out to whoever picked out all of Patricia Clarkson’s necklaces. i think brad pitt getting a credit in this is funnier than any joke in anything that came out this year. i found this whole thing pretty hypocritical, but what a nail in the coffin. I used to be good friends with Rose McGowan (although haven't talked to her since she moved to Mexico) and it's funny that the report of the phone call is her getting mad at New York Times for excluding her on a past article.  The article in question was ""Female Directors to Watch"" and she was livid that they didn't include her since she had done a short film that got into Sundance.  But she kept raging about it, like it was an avert slight.  The same with the short not getting nominated for an Oscar which she took as a slight on her because she was a celebrity and her work was devalued... and not that there could possibly be amazing short films that got those slots. It was fine. Nothing earth shattering, very paint by numbers journalism movie. The actual audio of the Battilana-Weinstein encounter was quite uncomfortable though.

I dunno, a newspaper movie just doesn't hit in the digital age.

Also I thought it was cool that they mentioned Ronan Farrow also working on the story for the New Yorker. Highly recommend his book 'Catch and Kill' about his reporting of the story. Not a bad movie per se, but I did find it kinda bland. The characters were pretty one dimensional. It also doesn't feel like we got a new perspective so I hardly see the point of the film. It seems it's all stuff we knew already. Something also felt off like the film was Hollywood really just patting itself on the back for taking down Weinstein while also sort of feeling like something co produced by the New York times trying to show how awesome they think they are. I don't know it just sometimes didn't feel sincere or authentic or real enough. It felt safe and sanitized. But like I said not really bad. Performances were passable with a watchable story. But just didn't feel meaningful enough. 6/10 Like most everyone is saying, fine and bland. One thing I thought was left hanging was the PIs stalking the journos, particularly Kantor. I forgot the name she mentioned in the office who was calling her constantly but ""security checked her out"" - thought there would be more to this. I just saw this movie and agree with most who say it’s bland. 
I also felt like this movie had alot of a certain type of dialogue that I really hate, although I struggle to describe it or put a name on it. Maybe someone can help me. Sort of overly-descriptive dialogue that isn’t how real people talk. movie was good asf I wanted to like it more. Maybe it's because I already have knowledge of the case or how the investigation worked but it never seemed to really build revelations. Many of the assaults had the same method so throughout it just felt like we were stuck. Also, while the anger is justified, it felt very obvious and on the nose with some of the dialogue. A very standard journalism movie with real good performances.

- Movie was quite accurate from I what I saw and read when the actual story broke.
- Pacing was great throughout the movie. Never felt the runtime. 
- Zoe Kazan and Carrey Mulligan have great chemistry together. Them laughing at each other wearing white dress and Zoe Kazan's character asking ""you don't think I intimidating?"" are genuinely funny moments.
- The recording of Ambra Gutierrez was hard to listen to.
- Jennifer Ehle was excellent in her small role. Her phone call with Jodi was the best part of the movie.
- Was weird seeing Tom Pelphrey as a supporting character and no noteworthy scenes from him
- Limiting Weinstein's presence to phone calls and back of head shots was a great movie. It helps to center the movie on the journalism itself not Weinstein. Watched this super baked, thought that I was being watched for watching this movie. 7/10 Minor nitpick but the software at the end annoyed me.  They had a guy manually pick out an extra space when that should probably be automatic.  They are apparently manually fixing whitespace issues but do not have whitespace characters displayed.  They have a lot of offline discussions about timing and what they need to get before they publish, but then have no approvals built in and apparently just click a few buttons.

The movie itself was okay.  Celebrity impersonations are almost always awkward in movies.  Some pieces like the harassment and stalker and even the reporters' families angles seemed pointless to me.  

I enjoyed watching it but it was just alright. I didn't get the Catskills memory conversation between Jodi Kantor and the former Weinstein exec; how did they know each others' backgrounds? Would appreciate an explaination. It is of the same caliber as ""The Post"" and ""Spotlight"". Is it me or was the Trump scene rather out of place for the tone the rest of the movie was trying to set? Then again it's kind of hard to have a serious scene with Donald Trump due to just how cartoonish the guy is in general! ",0,She Said
4," “Damn…my mentor died in my arms , I lost my virginity, and my mom who I just found out is my mom became the woman king…This has been one crazy day” lol Preferably without spoiling- was this actually good? Decent?

The disparity between rotten tomatoes both scored and IMDB is insane. Was honestly surprised this was PG-13. It felt a lot more brutal and violent than other movies with that rating. Goddamn that crawling through the thorns scene was intense. My biggest complaints were all the unnecessary stuff, including:

- Pointless romantic subplot
- Mother finding her long lost daughter out of nowhere
- The freaking shark tooth
- Being able to fake a broken arm after having someone press on it for a quick moment. 

Had fun with the majority of the movie, though. Thuso Mbedu is going to be a star. Damn,they made a movie called Woman King and then The Queen died Most surprising twist I did not see coming is Viola Davis injecting an Apple (Sharktooth) AirTag in her baby daughter long before NFC technology was made. It was way more enjoyable than the trailers made it look. Great movie but it drove me mad when Nanisca and Nuie (sorry about the spelling) jumped off a cliff, swam to the boats, were rowed 200 meters and then jumped out again bone dry.

Someone dropped the ball on the sense check there.

But yeah great movie- not everything needs to catch flack for historical accuracy. If we saw tons of movies about African female warriors and this particular one dropped the ball on the details, then sure go nuts.  But let’s not forget this type of film is still very much a rarity in Hollywood. Izogie was the GOAT, so naturally the movie had to kill the best character off to raise the stakes smh Saw it tonight.

1) This movie was phenomenal. I’d highly recommend it to anyone; it may be my movie of the year.

2) Nowhere does it even say “based on a true story.” It’s clearly just fiction with real nationalities in it. If you’re mad about *The Woman King*’s historical inaccuracies, you must’ve **hated** *The Last Samurai*.

3) Now millions of people may have the curiosity to learn about the Duhomey Kingdom and its actual past, which seems to me like it would be a big win for the historians on here.

Like, I legitimately hate forced wokeness in movies and it pulls me out every time – but *The Woman King* ain’t it. Viola Davis has the performance of her life. So much packed into a perfectly paced runtime. Why is the discourse around everything so exhausting now? My only complaint is the lack of an R rating. Makes the battle scenes feel kind of marvel... Acting, fantastic.  Cinematography, great. Fight scenese were precise and well choreographed.  [Historical accuracy...](https://c.tenor.com/kWejy2kDcTwAAAAC/office.gif).  

Think *Braveheart* in Africa, except the heroes are slavers. If you rolled your eyes at Gibson's William Wallace, you might have problem here.  Otherwise, this will be a big movie.  Surprised they released it in the fall rather than the summer This is probably a dumb question but did Nawi and Malik have sex? I felt like it was implied Thuso is going to be a star. Talk about a hell of a breakthrough role! I could see this movie getting some Oscar nominations, Viola for Best Actress 💯, Lashana Lynch Best Supporting Actress, maybe Thuso Mbedu Best Supporting Actress (some of her scenes tear your heart out), Cinematography, Costume Design and Best Picture. Well they at least ACKNOWLEDGE the slavery element.  So that’s good.

Unfortunately they kind of breeze by it rather quickly.

But as a FILM on it’s own terms, it’s quite good. Good fun movie with strong performances and cool fighting scenes. Felt like it could've been like 20 minutes shorter with a little less of the hinted romance, but that's all I've got in terms of complaints really. The movie that launched a million PhDs in African Studies. Honestly, during the second swimming pool scene, I was legitimately scared that Nanisca was gonna slap Nawi when she was yelling at her, but no, she just admits flat out that she was raped and reveals how she’s her daughter. I loved that subversion. The discourse around this is nothing but social media tail-chasing. Very tiring. It's a solid movie, contains moral contradictions and simplifications, doesn't always deal with its subject matter with 100% honesty BUT manages to tell a good story full of compelling characters who really resonated with me.

Just like I didn't walk out of Top Gun glorifying militarism and clamouring to sign up, I didn't walk out of this with any delusions about the reality of this kingdom and the painful realities of the slave trade. It's highly possible to do. People complain about how most films treat audiences like they're dumb but go on to prove that perhaps said movies are treating them exactly as they require. END CREDIT SCENE - Did the character reading the names of the fallen end with the name Breonna? That’s what I’m sure she said. Nice to see a flick with this many extras. Hundreds of real humans fighting on massive sets. 

Felt very 1970’s in that regard The question is...does this movie managed to stand on its own, regardless of historical innacuracy just like Patriot, The Last Samurai, etc?

People are being hypocritical in the way that this movie potentially rewrites history, but then jizzing their pants over other historical rewrite movies.

If the movie is good, it's good, if the movie is bad, it's bad and historical accuracy shouldn't be the way to judge that, otherwise most popular historic pieces aren't good as well. I was discussing this earlier with my friend. Do you guys think Nawi had sex with Malik during the cut scene? I’m trying to win an argument. ",0,The Woman King

*cut to Colin Farrell with a massive painting of Jesus behind him 

Adored this movie. Solid performances, amazing screenplay, and McDonagh’s most gorgeous looking fim to date. One of my favorite moments of the film was Siobhan correcting Colm about Mozart.

It shows that Colm was not as smart as he appeared to be, and cracked open his wise old man facade. He was being truthful to about his reasons for tanking the friendship, but his methods for doing so are still bullshit.

He is wise, but also bitter and stubborn, and that so he thinks that the key to breaking his monotony is by suffering.

I don’t actually think that Colm hates Paidric. He hates himself, and he is using Padraic being “dull” as an excuse to push his one true friend away. This movie was morbidly hilarious - my audience was having a great time with so many of the scenes. But it also balanced the drama really well.

I think the tragic thing about this story was really Dominic from what I gathered. Beaten by his father, rejected from love, had his innocence ruined when he discovered Padraic wasn't nice after all, and then died. Barry Keoghan's performance was great too, and I'm always impressed by him whether he's the Joker, Druig, or tormenting Colin Farrell in a Yorgos Lanthimos.

Also the death of Jenny was really tragic, you can really feel Padraic's pain as well. Colin Farrell's performance was superb in that moment, and if I could pick the Oscar reel then that's the scene I would choose. Speaking of which, I'd also choose Brendan Gleeson's second confession as his Oscar reel moment. There was a lot of very subtle acting from him and it really added to his character.

Colm's seeming emotional indifference vs. Padraic's emotional exclamations was a fascinating juxtaposition with Colm's assertion that Padraic was dull as well since one doesn't normally think of shows of emotions as being dull. The real Irish Civil War was friendship Absolutely phenomenal. I wanted to watch it again as soon as it finished.  

I really hope it cleans up at the Oscars. Just outstanding. I thought it was a great movie by all measurements but i was not in the right headspace to watch something this bleak with everything that's happening in the world.  To think of Padraic left alone in that little stone cottage, it was just too much for me to truly enjoy.  I'm all for different movies and i appreciate it when they stray from the typical happy ending, but right now i found this a difficult watch. Do you think Siobhan was ever wild, though? Being one of the most anticipated films of this year, I was not disappointed.

Martin McDonagh continues to achieve with his black comedy narratives and style. I have enjoyed every single film he has created and this probably is my favorite of his works. The camerawork is extremely beautiful, great uses of comedic and dramatic tones blended together, and amazing performances from all the cast members. The narrative is simple and basic but it worked because of McDonagh’s style of writing and his direction manages to take a simple story that is well-explored and darkly-hilarious. The characters are strange and funny to watch and the chemistry between Farrell and Gleeson is fantastic to witness. Hilarious and fun dialogue throughout!

Definitely one of my top picks of 2022

9/10 The zoom-in through the telescope onto Colm’s face is the funniest fucking thing I’m not seeing much or any commentary about  
the film’s allusions to civil war in this thread or the fact that Colm is the capital V Villain of the story. 

There’s a lot of blame being pushed onto Padraic for not respecting Colm’s wishes. That’s valid to an extent but Colm is the one who initiates the conflict and escalates it. His pride, selfishness, and pettiness results in fallout for innocents like Dominic, Jenny, and Shiobhan.

Nothing is really resolved or fixed at the end of the conflict for Padraic or Colm, Padraic loses everything he loves and Colm can no longer play music and admits that he’s in despair but won’t do anything about it.

In the end the two characters are worse off for their meaningless spat and again, Colm is the one who started it. He’s a faux intellectual pretending to be better than others on the island (specifically Padraic), he’s even called out for his hypocrisy by Siobhan (when he doesn’t know the time period Mozart was alive).

Colm admits to as much in the film, saying more or less that he’s doing this for his own amusement. 

Moral of the story, in my opinion, is that men create meaningless conflict for contrived reasons and that leads to innocents being hurt (kind of like a civil war).

Great movie that I certainly hope to revisit soon, Three Billboards is controversial to some but I think McDonagh is 4/4 on his films, what a filmography so far. I love the conversation being had here, but why is no one talking about Colm cutting off his fingers? That’s the only thing I can’t wrap my head around. Why would he do that to himself if he really just wanted to play and compose music with the rest of his life. I get that it’s to show Padraic he’s serious, but like…. Why? Is there something deeper I’m missing, an allegory for the Irish Civil War or something?

Loved the movie regardless. Barry Keoghan was phenomenal as Dominic.

  
My favourite scene is where Padraic (Farrell) who being called dull can at least take solace that he isn't the stupidest person on the island, only for Dominic to use the phrase ""touche"" to Padraic's first confusion and realisation that perhaps Dominic isn't the daftest brush in the room. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard while having my heart twisted at the same time.

As someone who got ghosted by the person I considered my best friend a couple years ago, this film brilliantly captured the emotions that come with sudden death of a friendship. The wondering what you did wrong, desire to revive the friendship, anger and resentment, and it ultimately being hard to stop dwelling on the friendship. It's taken me a while to heal, so this movie really hit me like a pile of bricks. Loved ‘Banshees’ endlessly. Still thinking about it a week later. 

I’m going off my (bad) memory, but my favorite line was during the second confession scene, in which the priest says, “do you think God gives a f**k about miniature ponies?” and Colm responds, “I think that’s what this is all about” (with Farrell’s character). 

Loved it. 9/10. Colin Farrell’s eyebrows deserve an Oscar I'm paraphrasing somewhat, but ""and if he is depressed, would he not keep it to himself like?"" is one of the most Irish sentiments I've heard put to film. Honestly, this might be Colin Farrell's best performance ever. The way he pushes back against Colm's requests to the point of futile desperation, and when you think he might change for the better, he doubles down and opens himself to hatred and spite...absolutely phenomenal stuff.

Between this, The Batman, Thirteen Lives, and After Yang (what I considered his best performance before I saw this), Colin's having a hell of a year. One of the major themes I have yet to see discusses here is Legacy.  
People worry about their legacy when they get close to death: ""How will I be remembered?""  
That's the guiding force for Colm's mistreatment of Padraic. Colm is afraid that when he is gone, no one will remember him.   
Padraic, in a drunken stupor, even adds to this point by yelling at Colm about ""niceness"" and how Padraic's mother was nice, his father was nice, and his sister is nice. Each one has a legacy of niceness.   
But who will tell Colm's legacy had he kept on just living regularly with Padraic as a friend?   
Colm has no children, no wife. He lives alone on the beach front with just his dog watching the war every morning and every night.   
He fears being forgotten and goes to great lengths to be remembered.   

His ideas may be stupid, ill-advised, ridiculous, angry, and off-putting, but they are his ideas to try to get himself remembered just like Mozart from the 17th century. ""Actually it's the 18th century""   

He's willing to destroy everything current, to preserve a future.   
And that's where the central theme of legacy ties in.  

Is the life you're living now more important than how you will be remembered? 

Padraic says yes. Colm says no.

Colm is willing to damage his current life (his friendship, his hand) in order to be remembered in the future. Release it wide cowards I love Barry Keoghan. He's so great in everything I've ever seen him in. 

Paraphrasing: ""I found a hook on a pole. What do you think it's used for? Hooking stuff that's a pole away?""

His first scene he found a hook on a pole and guessed what it's for. His last scene proved he was right Absolutely fucking superb. Not a single poor performance, even the bit-piece characters had memorable moments. Really do think Colin could get Best Actor and I’d love to see Brendan get Supporting. 






I do think it sits just below In Bruges, yet a good bit better than 3 Billboards and 7 Psychopaths, but I think it’ll only get better on consecutive watches. 



Really wish I’d managed to get to see them film in Achill as I’m very close to the area, but alas. Keem Bay looked beautiful, the whole bloody movie did. 



9.5/10. I knew McDonagh as a playwright before knowing him as a director, and this movie very much feels like one of his plays – which makes sense because after some digging I found out it actually did start off as a play! It was supposed to finish off his 'trilogy' of Inish-plays: The Cripple of Inishmaan and The Lieutenant of Inishmore being the other two.   


If you haven't already, check out his plays A Skull in Connemara, The Beauty Queen of Leenane, and The Lonesome West for more in the same vein. He's such a good playwright, and this movie to me captures everything that's great about his plays. Loved the movie. 

So the “ghoul” lady was totally representative of a banshee right? Also how tragic is it that Dominic commits suicide after he realizes there is no kindness on the island after Padraic reveals his cruel prank on one of the island inhabitants, so he retreats to the only kind soul on the island, Siobhan only to be left rejected.

What do you guys make of Colm being in the house initially when the house was burning and then being found alive at the end of the film? I loved this movie. 

I like how they kept showing that Colm just wasn't that talented at all. So while he blamed Padraic for holding him back, he was the obvious problem. He was a failed musician who never left his small island, and didn't even know in which century his hero Mozart was born. He was basically just a bitter nobody who never worked hard or accomplished anything - which ironically is what he accused his friend of being, but at least his friend was nice.

Then him cutting off his fingers, once again blaming his friend for something that was entirely his own fault. Also gave him a reason to never play music again and live in the belief that he ""could have been something"" if it wasn't for his friend, which is a more comfortable belief then coming to grips with your own failures.  

So in the end I guess it was a story about two simple guys - but one of them knew he was simple, and the other thought he was special.  

What an awesome movie Likely the funniest and saddest movie I'll see all year. This is McDonagh's most restrained, contemplative, and affecting movie of his career. Gleeson and Farrell are both magnificent as best friends turned ""we're no longer on speaking terms"". There's a touch of Vonnegut, and Kafka, and John Kennedy Toole to this movie's bleak sense of humour. It's cold and bitter and unforgiving, but beneath the surface there's a little light of humanity yet burning. The characters in this movie ponder legacy, time, a life's worth, morality, and the value of being nice. The movie itself relishes in pondering these ideas more than making any broad conclusions about them. But it's the lack of any real answers that make such things worth pondering in the first place. 

The residents of Inisherin whether concerned with life's greater mysteries or more content playing out their various roles as townsfolk, have at least one thing in common. They persist in their purgatorial life. Despite the apparent meaninglessness, despite the proximity of tragedy and war, they take solace in drink or song, and wake up the next day to face it all again. Depending on who you ask, that's the beauty of life or it's cruelest twist. Despite the perpetual overcast that sits over Inisherin, I ultimately found this movie to be equal parts bleak and affirming. ",0,The Banshees of Inisherin
6," Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and list off a few positives:

- Olivia Colman is magnetic. Hard to believe I first saw her as the inappropriate police officer in Hot Fuzz and now she's probably one of the most dependably solid actors working today.

- Roger Deakins is very pretty. Both his work and himself (I mean that hair!). But seriously, I visually enjoyed this movie a lot.

- The music, when actually used, was very nice. A very nice part of the film.

Now beyond those things, I am at a loss for how much I didn't enjoy this. It seems that at any moment the film would change the message it was trying to get across. There's nothing wrong with a movie wanting to tackle multiple social issues at once but between the takes on feminism, racism, power dynamics, and mental health, this film just felt all over the place. This movie never really made a powerful statement on any of those issues, it more just seemed to bring them up and then whimper off.

And speaking of all over the place, this movie had SO MANY endings. I think Sam Mendes must've just kept shooting for no reason whatsoever because I could never tell when the film was going to end after the second seeming ending. As the movie went on, I liked it less and less and less.

I would not recommend this to anyone outside of recommending a lovely Olivia Colman performance. Of the various films slated for awards-season release that I managed to catch on the festival circuit this year, this was by far the worst. It's passable at best, but so much of it feels like someone gave an AI a list of social topics that the Academy loves and it tried to shove them all together into a film. It would have been much better if they'd focused on just one or two plots instead of trying to meander through four different storylines.

Lots of wasted potential here with the cast, especially Toby Jones, who deserves more work. If I had to pick the best aspect of the film, it's that it does look gorgeous. Deakins doesn't miss. It was a very pretty film but it was all over the place.  Too many elements that treated serious subject superficially.  Also, why on earth >!would you let someone finger blast you right after they handled a pigeon!< Love it when Oscar bait movies fall flat on their stupid faces I saw this at the LFF in October and growing up twenty minutes down the road from where it was filmed, I felt so nostalgic for this film but not for the reasons Sam Mendes intended. I've walked down the seafront countless times, I've been to Dreamland (the amusement park used), I've walked the high streets and unfortunately have been in the hospital used when my Mum was at her worst before she passed. I wanted to see this film since I learnt of it to show a bit of hometown pride but from the first scene looking out of the cinema I was hit with a huge amount of emotions.

As I film I don't think it's anything particularly special, but it really resonated with me simple because I spent so much time as a kid, I mean shit I saw some of my first movies in the cinema they use. It's hard not to let that bias overcome me here.

Also as a side, Fabelmans isn't out in the UK yet but I have seen Babylon due to work and I swear if Fabelmans also has a scene of (very slight Babylon spoiler) >!a main character crying while being backlit by a projector in a cinema!< ima flip out. All three of these films are love letters to film in some way, all out on consecutive weeks here and will all have the same scene in. I can't stress how excited I was when I first saw this trailer. Sam Mendes, shots are looking great, Olivia Colman, Angel Olsen song, and it's a love letter to film? Can't wait. Turns out I could have waited. 

It's not a bad movie by any stretch. It's just very underwhelming considering all the talent involved. It looks absolutely fantastic, the shots were breathtaking and lighting was so important from the very first moment. Olivia Colman is really great in it as she is in everything. I just wish it had more impact, and I wish it explored its own themes more thoroughly. 

That's the main issue is that there are so many seemingly good movies packed into this tight two hours that none of them seem fleshed enough. You have a woman who wants to feel alive again and finding that through a relationship, you have the race relations of 1980's coastal England, the power of filmmaking, and mental health struggles. They don't blend poorly as I wasn't bored and it never felt off topic, but I didn't feel like I got a thorough understanding of any of them. 

There is a lot to appreciate, especially if you frequent the theater. I liked that the theater employees were all outcasts or people who were looking for an escape, and that they always felt like a fun family Firth notwithstanding (who was, in his own way, running from his home life). 

I like the idea that Norman explains, that films are just lighted frames with darkness in between, but if you move them fast enough you don't see the dark. It's indicative of why Stephen was taken by film, because it would let him live in an ideal world for a minute even though the realities of the world outside were inescapable. The plot of him teaching that to Hillary, who is dealing with her own issues of reality, is what works best about this movie. The most fulfilling moment is probably when she sits down to finally watch a film, although I know a projectionist or two and absolutely zero of them would run a movie for you when they were about to go home lmao. 

But, in the end when it comes for this generally humorless drama to really get at me, it just doesn't hit the homerun. I did get something out of it and it has its moments and a very nice ending that is actually more uplifting than I expected. But all the domino pieces were set up and they just didn't connect. 6/10. Still some shots and performances worth seeing, but it's tough to see this movie so close to Fabelmans. The racists are rioting outside the theater, and they let a black guy approach to lock the transparent glass doors I really enjoyed this film. I went in without knowing much at all what the movie would be about, so I did not have expectations. At first I wasn’t too sure on the movie, but after the sand castle beach scene I realized that there was more to her mental illness than just depression (I initially thought that’s why she was going to the psychiatrist) and I found the rest of the movie to be phenomenal. Absolutely loved the apartment scene when the police break down the door. Each slam on the door was so jarring and there was no rhythm to it so I was always bracing for the next one. 9/10 for me. All in all, Empire of Light was passable. I could follow the plot, I found myself compelled by the storylines, and was impressed with some of the acting performances (Colin Firth in particular). 

That said, I think this movie is representative of a worrying trend in Hollywood. Super glossy, super A-list packages of actors, directors, and production staff that have big budgets and get pressed hard, but ultimately fall short. 

I understand the game being played. Producers need big names attached to get movies sold. But, lukewarm stories and talented actors hidden away in overcrowded casts aren’t the way to make lasting hits. 6/10 Well, it's a lovely film in many ways such as the cinematography and score.  The story is definitely rushed.  I would have liked to have gotten to know the characters, including secondary characters, more.    


THAT scene as I'm going to forever refer to it >!where Stephen finger bangs Hilary after handling a pigeon !<is forever indelible in my mind.  Can I bleach it from my brain?  It's not even a bad scene; it's the utter lack of hygiene that gets me. I swear every movie hyped by filmbros have flopped this year by a lot I think reading all of the negative takes on Reddit before seeing the film allowed my expectations to remain low — and I was pleasantly surprised. It’s a lovely, elegiac film buoyed by stunning visuals and remarkable lead performances. Olivia Colman obviously makes her mark but I was most impressed by the show stealer Michael Ward. His elegance and vulnerability throughout were such a masterclass in allowing the audience to surmise his emotions and thoughts without the script having to express too many of them. 

Frankly, I didn’t find the film’s focus on social issues too widespread at all. It felt to me like a very clear story about two people at different points in their lives alienated by society for different reasons. The cinema is where they connected and found a relief from the loneliness of their respective experiences, and where they learned to open themselves up to each other. 

A definite 9/10 for me. Saw this at the London Film Festival back in October and actually left the screening thinking wow, that was good (something I didn't think after watching more well recieved films like Banshees of Insisherin and Everything Everywhere All At Once). Most of the film really moved me and it was only the way it tried to shoehorn in the racism and mental health storylines that stopped it from being the perfect film in my books. Otherwise I found myself so invested in both the film as a whole and the various character relationships. Double feature with “Saint Maud”?: it feels like a weird coincidence that we’re getting two movies about mental illness and loneliness in British boardwalk towns. I would argue, though, that “Empire“‘s ending was a bit more hopeful. Saw it at TIFF, was into it until right after the premiere of Chariots of Fire. The film had focus right before that point but afterwards it started to stumble. Hilary's mental breakdown, the riots, everything that was meant to be a culmination felt out of nowhere and the story did collapse under the weight of all the plotlines. Plus it felt like it was about to end right when Hilary came back, but then it continued for a never-ending extra length of time. I also thought we'd end on the Being There scene, but unfortunately it kept going after that and ended on a very flat note. 

In hindsight I also can't help but feel like this movie is too much of an Oscar Bait checklist to feel authentic. Racism, check. Mental illness, check. Period setting, check. An old fashioned Romance, check. Love of old cinema and going to the movies, check. Sam Mendes has always been a prestigious director but I do think this movie is his most standard and typical film when his others have typically had qualities that set them apart.

It's presented with obviously beautiful cinematography and the characters were easy to be invested in, plus I was okay with the story for half of it. But it's that second half and the overall choices made that make it fairly mid-tier in Mendes's career.

P.S. The Being There scene was the most manufactured and manipulative movie scene I've seen in a while. It felt like the kind of scene that film fans complain about with the whole ""Hollywood loves movies that depict film and the industry in a positive light"", not to mention that I already had that ""love of watching a movie in the cinema"" feeling just being at TIFF already and didn't need a scene to remind me. I see why Mendes wanted a moment like that particularly after a year where theatres were mostly shut, but it felt like a step into indulgence. Olivia Colman kicked it up a notch with her ""monologue"" in her apartment before being taken away.

Great film. I saw the trailer for this and all I could think was that it was “Oscar Bait: The Movie.” Period piece related to the film industry with an interracial romance between people of different generations with that cast, director, and release window? Yeah, I’m not at all surprised at the lackluster reviews. I have not seen it, but would like to find it online because it won't come anywhere near where I live.  I still have hope to at least enjoy it (minus the pigeon scene mentioned-- hygiene).  The soundtrack is FABULOUS.  Man, Nine Inch Nails has definitely changed since my hardcore scene days.  Look Trent Reznor now! If I may ask, will there be a discussion thread for GdT soon? Nice to see people feeling about this film the same way I've felt about all of Mendes's Oscar-bait dramas. > Olivia Colman

She will always be the Numberwang woman to me. You had my curiosity but now you have my attention. What did I just read??? I'm going to have nightmares now. It’s a fetish.

7," The dialogue at the third act felt to me as if someone was trying to talk to me after waking me up out of a deep sleep. This felt like an AI’s interpretation of what a movie is. I couldn’t tell when it was taking itself too seriously or not seriously enough. Everything is laid out so plainly, and if something is important each character in the scene would repeat the line just in case you missed it. I was painfully aware I was watching a movie the entire time. Crazy cast though. About halfway through I realized that this was the Smedley Butler story. And now, having watched it, I think I would have rather seen a movie about the actual incident instead of a roman à clef version. every piece of this production was half-assed. 

sounded like the first draft of the script, looked like they only got one shot of each line, looked like they forgot which angle or character they were shooting immediately after they ended each take, looked like they fucked up a move so they retried it and just jumpcut the two takes together, looked like the first cut of the movie overall, seemed like the actors only found out that they had this commitment day-of, sounded like the sound editor just hit ""balance"" and assumed that the music wouldn't overpower the dialogue, seemed like they had a small idea for what could drive the plot and hoped that could carry the motivations and stakes ( it didn't ), seemed like they thought they could use a bandaid of ""love"" and ""kindness"" to cover up a lazy theme that only loosely connected to the actual plot This script needed a second rewrite. The amount of over explaining of the main theme (I think I got the idea that this film was about kindness about halfway through and my god, did I know by the final quarter of it). The characters feel like nothing, the editing feel first time edit while also like they left a lot on the floor. 

The film cost 80 million and sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t. That ending went on for so long I just wanted to leave so badly. What a waste of talent on such a shoddy script. Yikes… that gala segment felt like 45 minutes What was annoying about the finale is that they tried to beat you over the head with the fact that Voze was aligned with the Nazis (he was inordinately chummy with the other fascist executives, and he was using pervitin, for crying out loud), but then still wanted it to be a big reveal as if it was some shocking revelation. *raises invisible glass unenthusiastically*

To Amsterdam. Not hyperbolizing, that's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know if there was some kind of satire angle going on, but if there was and the premise is ""haha look at how bad we made this movie, isn't that funny?"" the answer is, unfortunately not really. 

There's only one production scenario that could satisfy the outcome of how this movie turned out, and it's this: none of the actors were given a script, it's entirely improvisational and they're only given one take on each scene. That's the only scenario that could even remotely justify what I just watched.

I really can't blame the actors at all for the dismal, incredibly boring performances they gave. When Christian Bale, John David Washington, Robert DeNiro, Michael Shannon, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Rami Malek all suck ass in a movie at the same time, it's clearly not the actors' fault.

TL;DR: Yikes. 2/10 with an extra point for being occasionally so outlandishly bad that it boiled over to kinda funny. Idk how to explain but I’ll try . This movie I could feel in each scene everyone was acting and not the characters. I felt like with such a stacked cast they all felt like they were waiting for one person to stop talking so they could say their line . Very much drive by acting with each cameo. Margot Robbie in that dress good lord All in all, I enjoyed the movie. It was a little hard to follow; kinda like the first time I saw The Men Who Stare at Goats. I wonder if I'll watch it sometime down there line and like it more.

Also it felt king of like watching a play without a fourth wall... Not sure how else to explain that. Maybe it has to do with the cuts and editing or somethin'. This is ""Friends we met along the way"" the movie. Shoutout to the handheld cameras from 1930 having better focus than my iPhone I kept waiting for the movie to click but it never quite happened.  It felt so uneven and just slightly off from being good.  Alot of good performances but they felt kinda wasted. Cast? Great

Chemistry? Great

Production design? Great

Plot? … You know how in bad improv there’s that noticeable pause after every line because nobody’s sure if the other person is done yet? This film has that with every line. It wasn’t improvised, there was a script. There were many scripts. It’s just not a good film. Worst script ive ever had to sit through. Noone acts like a human being, it constantly interrupts itself with no payoff, and almost none of the jokes have any comedic timing The story started as a murder mystery, turned into pro veteran propaganda, and then attempted to become a historical depiction of what happened back then. Zero cohesion in the screenplay. It was a ridiculous attempt at being artistic. Like the director/writer wanted to give us a theatrical experience, but then it switched over to a regular drama (scene in Voze's mansion).

It narrated absolutely everything, including the obvious stuff, which is as condescending as a movie can be.

Dialogue never felt grounded and real. No one talks like the characters from this movie in real life.
It was well shot, but jarringly edited. Such weird cuts in between scenes. It tried to be funny, and although it does have a couple of genuinely decent jokes, some scenes feel so tonally different from the rest. For example, the pre-Nazis vs the black veterans. What the hell was even that?

The story's plot had no stakes. I never felt like anyone was in danger. Burt was never going to jail, everyone was so lenient with him. The whole spies vs Nazis subplot was so shallow that we never felt it what was at play. The ENTIRE story about the 3 friends' relationship was shoved in, but was not really relevant at all to the story's resolution.

Washington and Robbie saying ""Amsterdam"" to the camera like in a bad copy of a Wes Anderson movie.
Rami Malek being the villain was so on the nose, and the reveal felt like a Scooby Doo episode: ""I would have financed the Nazis if it weren't for you, meddling kids!""

This was worse than the latest Fantastic Beasts movie and worse than The Tourist. Waste of time. I'm starting to wonder when the John David Washington experiment will end. He is *not* his father and comes off as a brick reading cue cards every time I see him (which admittedly is just this film and *Tenet*).  

Margot Robbie was decent but did phone it in a bit.  

Christian Bale was great. They might have added too much to the character that at certain times he comes off as a vaudevillian caricature rather than a real person, but I didn't hate it. 

Robert DeNiro was Robert DeNiro. 

Chris Rock stole every scene he was in. He was great. (""WHITE WOMAN... I'd rather be on trial for killing 5 white men than 1 white woman."")

The writing was weak, the direction was abhorrent and couldn't pick a style. Was it a comedy? Was it a drama? Was it a dramedy? Whatever it was, it was a failure.   

They also co-opted the business plot so poorly that people will forget (even with the credits scenes) that it was real because they changed all the names. David should have cast Melissa Leo as Mrs. Dillenbeck. Not enough famous faces. Regal unlimited so not as impactful of a statement but I walked out.  Acting felt so weird and it dragged so I finally left after I finished my popcorn.  Might try it again when I’m ready for it but it was just too much of nothing for me. Movies unironically does a 

*record scratch, freeze frame*

“Yup that’s me, you’re probably wonder how I got in this situation.”

And that about tells you all you need to know about how good the script is. Man, that was bad. What the hell?

Those two detectives though, loved every scene with them and wish we got more. They had more chemistry than Robbie and Washington, that's for sure. Painfully boring and uninteresting. The most interesting thing was Taylor Swift's acting. Ugly camerawork too. ",0,Amsterdam
8," As it's unpinned, don't forget to give the [Bruckheimer AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/uz0bwk/im_film_and_television_producer_jerry_bruckheimer/) a read. Very impressed with the way they included Val Kilmer in the movie. It was respectful and managed to be heart wrenching without leaving the audience feeling too depressed about the his condition. He's still such a star. Tom Cruise putting the whole damn movie industry on his back. The original Top Gun is something like a seminal cinematic event in my life - it was the last movie I saw in my hometown cinema with my buddies after graduating high school in 1986, a movie I went out to see with a whole new group of buddies that fall off at college for the first time. God, we all loved that movie - quoted it incessantly. We didn’t watch it as much as absorb it. The Top Gun soundtrack is pretty much the soundtrack of that whole year in my memory. To this day, I drive my wife crazy when it comes on TV because I have every line memorized and I can’t keep my mouth shut - I have to ape every piece of dialogue. So it’s a film that clicks a few personal boxes - entertaining as it gets, a rite of passage, a sentimental favorite, and a testament to the power and charisma that was - and is - Tom Cruise.

At the time, it never occurred to me that it was one of those movies that required a sequel. As the years passed, and Hollywood circled back to so many familiar successes, the idea of a sequel became more enticing, but it never seemed Cruise was on board and as someone who holds the original close to his heart, I get it - it’s one of the cornerstones of his film legacy, and it was daunting to consider the disappointment of a poorly executed follow. Why risk it?

I sat in TG Maverick today as a 53-year-old man who has lived a full life in the 36 years since the original. And I have to say, maybe that’s why the experience felt so personal - it certainly played like it was personal to Cruise, too. It’s hard not to watch this film without the ghost of the original hanging over every moment, and the brilliance of this film was that it didn’t shy away from that weight - without any moment becoming mawkishly sentimental or playing needless fan service that detracted from the story. It was a nostalgic experience, and a love letter from Cruise to the audience and his fans, as much as his intro at the beginning. It was modern and thrilling and as much fun as I’ve had at the theater in years, and it was a time capsule at the same time, a reflection on all that’s transpired since the original.

My wife - who admittedly is not the biggest Top Gun fan in the world - was first to suggest that we’re returning to the theater to watch it again this weekend. That’s how much she loved it. Me, I’m just in one of those moods where I’d thank Tom Cruise personally if I could. It’s been a long wait, it’s been a hell of a ride, and it was one hell of a movie. Nice little moment when Rooster says “talk to me dad” and Maverick’s voice comes through. Shows the father-son relationship they had before the disagreement. IMO Tom Cruise's best stunt yet is jumping out of Jennifer Connelly's window Top Gun 1986 love scene: French kissing 

Top Gun Maverick love scene: heartfelt adult conversation and cuddling. 2 top moments for me:

- Mavericks solo trial run 
- the enemy plane's evasive maneuver


What a movie.

The subtle thing I appreciate from his solo run is that it's not easy, even for him. He's constant grunting and nearly passed out at 9+G Early in the movie, when Maverick is first at the bar, there's a shot where he's sort of sitting back and watching ""the Top Gun remake movie"" playing out before his eyes, smirking at how silly it is.

After that, the movie goes back to being HIS movie, and it's all the better for it. He's the star. He carries the film. He makes it great. Driving home from this movie is fucking DANGEROUS Loved it

Something I want to point out is I loved how they really drilled the fight path into you throughout the movie. When it got to pulling it off for real, the movie trusted that you understood the mission without holding your hand. There was no ""here's the bit where we go up high and nearly pass out, guys!"" or other distracting exposition. They just let you be in the moment and experience it as the pilots did With 2616 comments in here, I doubt anyone will read this but the hell with it. I grew up on Top Gun and I watched it on repeat endlessly. Between the ages of 5 and 15 if you asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up my answer was always, “a naval aviator”. Top Gun WAS my childhood. Tomcats, Tom Cruise and the need for speed? Nothing made me happier and more excited as a kid.  

When the reviews first started coming out and I saw the rotten tomatoes score I just couldn’t believe it. There’s no way this movie was going to be THAT good. Not 36 years after the original. Hollywood simply doesn’t make great nostalgic sequels. They’re all just money grabs with terrible plots. I couldn’t have been more wrong.  

It’s been a long time since I had my jaw drop in a movie. It’s been a long time since I sat in a seat and felt like a giddy little kid again. This movie was SPECTACULAR. This simply has to be seen on the big screen. It has to. It’s arguably the best action scenes I’ve ever seen in a theater. Every time I thought the last scene couldn’t be topped they went ahead and topped it. And the F14 theft and jokes about it being a museum piece, I love every single second of it.  

Tom Cruise did the impossible (pun not intended). He made me feel like a little kid again. For 131 minutes I forgot about everything happening in the world and just sat there in awe and grinning like an idiot. Movies are escapism. And this is simply pure blockbuster escapism.. Random thoughts:

1. Not as many ""now kiss"" moments between bros as the first one.
  

2. I like how Miles Teller got all ripped and macho for this role but as soon as he put his oxygen mask on, his eyes still had the same expression as the terrified little kid who got bullied by JK Simmons.
  

3. Am I the only one who noticed how similar the music that played near the end when they're on the aircraft carrier was to Inception's Time?

4. Glad to see they didn't have Maverick follow the trope of ""old master gets surprise-beaten by upcoming hotshot"". He was consistently the best pilot of the group and never had a moment of ""oh shit maybe I'm not as good as I once was"". I can confirm Tom Cruise runs in this movie. 10/10 The final 45 minutes are ridiculously good. Biggest breakout for me here was Glen Powell. The level of charisma and charm and presence this guy has was leaping off the screen. He was great in Hidden Figures but this was another level. Very keen to see what he does next. The guy passing out in the plane and recovering followed immediately by the bird in the engine was the most insane moment of the film to me. Can't believe I forgot about it until now. 

I genuinely thought they were both going to die Did anyone else's showing have a message from Tom Cruise before the movie? He was mostly talking about how hard the crew and everyone worked on it and to enjoy the movie. Watched at an AMC in San Diego ""What were you thinking""

""You told me not to think!""

Fucking 10/10 OHHHHHHHH

Penny is the admiral's daughter Bob is the real MVP Yeah, the flying was next level sexy as hell. But still not as sexy as Jennifer Connelly leaving that door open. Star Wars are you watching ? This is how you make a sequel to a movie 30+ years later 

A contemporary love letter to a bygone era. I'm not being hyperbolic when i say it's right up there with T2 and BR 2049 on how you should make a modern sequel to an evergreen classic Hate to be that guy but as soon as the movie finished I asked for a partial refund.


I paid for the whole seat but all I needed was the edge. Glen Powell has movie-star charisma. He should be in more things. ",0,Top Gun: Maverick
9," Having seen both this and the documentary, I really appreciated Howard's widening the scope to include the less visible helpers, like the farmers whose crops were ruined and the water engineers/labourers. Everybody pulling together for the common goal. I like movies like this where everyone is competent in their field of knowledge and the professionals are listened to. I personally loved how the characters were played. They are ordinary people, not over the top superheroes. One of Ron Howard's best in years. Beautifully shot, especially nighttime and underwater scenes. Ok! The movie hit real real hard.

Moments of literal emotion, almost crying and just shivers down the spine at all the milestone moments.

Beautifully made. Might just be Ron Howard's best work for me.  


No dramatization of anything. No portrayal of politics, or the rights and the wrongs. A movie that truly honours the people, the volunteers involved in the rescue, and most importantly the people who lost their lives. Man, Ron Howard is solid. He'll probably never make my *favorite* film, but he's so good at making *very good* films that are always going to outshine so many other pseudo-blockbuster-type films. And he hasn't lost a step, I feel, within his purview. I really liked how they didn't over dramatize this one. A lesser director would have done more to make you feel uneasy, failing to realize the source material already does that. Think of how they edit reality TV shows and enhance the mood with dramatic music.

Here they respect the audience enough to understand the gravity of the situation, and don't feel the need to try to manipulate in fearing for their safety. I really enjoyed it and didn't realize how bonkers of an extraction method they actually attempted until I saw it in this film. 

I do wish Howard put a little more emphasis on how long of a journey it was each dive instead of just a time stamp. Even just once. Excellent film. Actually would've liked to have seen it in theaters. As others stated it would've been good to get a better sense of how long that journey was to and from the cave. Obviously you can't show the whole thing, but the map and timestamp didn't really do it justice. Maybe some kind of intercut between the journey and worried parents, Thai Navy divers talking amongst themselves, etc. But hey, I'm not going to tell Ron Howard, Brian Grazer or William Nicholson how to make a movie. I simply enjoyed watching a mostly (RIP Saman Gunan and Beirut Pakbara) “feel good” movie that highlights bravery, heroism, and international cooperation. 

I felt like Colin Farrell had the best performance of the “main” characters, but mostly the film didn’t give any of them big dramatic moments which I think was the right choice. The film isn’t meant to emphasize performance, but the task before the characters. No one character is more “likable” or “unlikable” than the other. That’s hard to do. They’re just people here to do a job for the good of humanity, forget anything else. 

I’ve seen a lot of “true story” films, and this is probably the first one to completely capture the heroism of just about everyone portrayed. From the Thai Navy Seals, to the farmers sacrificing their crop, to the parents of the boys, to the boys themselves, and then of course every diver who ventured into that cave. Now we talking. Now this is a movie. We have Viggo, Colin Farrel and Joel Edgerton. Viggo and Colin are absolutely great in this. This is just very well made mid-budget thriller with great actors, a great real life story and sverything on point. It’s thrilling, you root for the characters, great acting.
Feels like Everest but better and not a downer of story.
Cool dudes who know their shit and do it well. Awesome. Must watch.

8/10. I find it so funny how much they actually seemed to water the story down for the movie. I watched the documentary immediately after this, and a lot of what I thought was made up for the movie was real and some times even more intense! a nice complement to the NatGeo documentary ""The Rescue"" which was goddamn amazing and I recommend to all [deleted] I loved it. My body was so tense in those diving scenes. The movie made me feel a range of emotions even while knowing the outcome. Acting was top notch. Ron Howard makes solid watchable films. Ones that you can see over and over. It’s a shame they didn’t include Elon Musk’s heroic offering of a non-existent, extremely impractical submarine device, and subsequent baseless public “pedo” accusation of the British diver. The real Dr. Richard ""Harry"" Harris (played by Joel Edgerton in the movie).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI_5bhlXOAs

The real guy is more Aussie, more confident, funny, positive.  But Joel plays him much more restrained.  The video has Harris narrating what happened in 2018.  He's quite a good speaker.

He mentions why the governor was ""sacked"".  He was a whistleblower and so they were going to get rid of him.  Harris felt the governor was a man of integrity and the incident probably saved his career. I still can't believe this is a real thing that actually happened I really enjoyed this, definitely showed just how difficult the situation was. Also how brave all involved were, thinking about being tied up, anaesthetised and carried through that cave is terrifying.  

The underwater cinematography was brilliant, they did an excellent job of making the viewer feel the claustrophobic nature of cave diving.

They also did a great job at portraying some real life heroes while showing that at the end of the day they’re just people, virtues, flaws and all. Plus one for including how stressful it all is and showing that through Chris’ trauma at the end and John’s (Collin Farrell) when the kid wasn’t breathing. 

Overall solid 8/10 for me. SPOILERS SOMEWHAT

I think Ron Howard, having done some documentaries, got the actors to downplay their emotions.  He wanted to make it far less dramatic.  Because he split time between the Thai people and the divers, you don't get a chance to get any real deep conversations like you do in APOLLO 13 where there's only 3 people in a confined space (and Houston, of course).

Colin Farrell really hides into this role.  I really had a hard time seeing Farrell while Viggo is just Viggo.  I think most of the divers don't have a lot to say because there's so much plot to get through and the story itself is interesting.  For example, when you get the kids out of the cave, you have this dilemma.  Mostly, the rescue for each kid is roughly the same.  So do you show it all?  Everyone?  If you don't, it feels disrespectful to those that aren't.  If you do, it eats up a lot of film time.

When you watch this with THE RESCUE, and I've also seen an Australian documentary made for TV, and many interviews with Dr. Harris, and the American military (I listened to 2 1-hour interviews or presentations to hear their contribution to the rescue).  

First, Dr. Harris (Harry) is more of a cheerful Aussie bloke than in the movie where Edgerton plays him as deeply conflicted.  It's not to say he didn't have conflict, but if you watch interviews, he describes in matter of factly.  They had to skip the parts where they were still discussing alternatives (keep the boys in the cave through monsoon season) which was shot down for a variety of reasons.

One was decreasing oxygen.  One was flooding that might prevent them from getting food for long periods of time.  Also, if they had diseases, it would be hard to treat.  Dr. Harris (who actually arrived with another cave diver friend that was also a veterinarian, but did not appear in the movie or in THE RESCUE) arrived on a Saturday and had to make his mind up quick, and they still needed to get permission for him to do the medical procedure as he was not permitted to practice medicine in Thailand without permission (which was given surprisingly quickly).  The rescue started the following Monday.

I think they must have spent the day he arrived or Sunday trying to see how feasible the plan was.  This was organized partly by the American military whose main role was to provide (quick) logistical support and make sure action was being taken to solve the problem.

They found a nearby Thai school, some school boys as volunteers, and tested how they needed to be tied up.  They might have actually done this prior to Harris arriving as the idea of drugging them up was actually proposed much earlier (Rick's character).

They really had to skip over any other countries involvement.  Chinese and Indians helped, but not clear how.  They said a dozen countries came in.  Already, THIRTEEN LIVES had to cut out many pieces because of how big everything was and trying to avoid being too sprawling of a movie.

Where THIRTEEN LIVES shines compared to THE RESCUE are the actual mechanics of the rescue.  THE RESCUE did reenactments as no one had video of underwater scenes (it would have been pitch black, in any case).  It shows how much scrapes divers get through, how much their heads bang on the cave.

Another interesting fact was that only one boy could speak English.  the rest could not.  He is apparently multilingual, and was one of several stateless boys from nearby Myanmar.  The coach was also stateless.  All of them were given Thai citizenship.

Dr. Harris, in numerous interviews, felt like this plan would never work and that most, if not all kids, would die, but at least, they wouldn't suffer if they did die.  If left in the caves, there would likely be disease, starvation, loss of oxygen, and drowning.

Turns out the cave flooded the day after the final rescue and stayed flooded for 8 months, making it obvious that the decision made to rescue the boys then and there was the only thing possible.

It's times like this that you wish the boy's birthday was a week later.  They went in at a bad time, and the water rose so quickly that despite a short visit, they were trapped very quickly.  At least they knew the caves well enough to know where to head to. I just want to thank Ron Howard for not casting Marky Mark in this movie When they did the anesthesia I was like no fucking way. I remember hearing the story but I had no clue they did this. That’s fucking wild. What a story. Great movie. Viggo and Collin were awesome. As a Thai person watching this I appreciate having actual Thai actors casted instead of bring all the big name asian actors playing the parts The scene where divers found the boys but had to leave because there was nothing they could do was gut wrenching. The complexity of the situation was palpable. The coach’s guilt, the boys’ hopes and fears, and John’s helplessness in not wanting to leave the boys behind but had to. It was for me personally one of the most emotionally charged moments in the film. I liked it. Felt realistic and not overly dramaticized. No good guys and bad guys. Just people doing their jobs. ",0,Thirteen Lives
10," The twins were easily the best part for me personally The Wolf getting an entire music video montage detailing his tragic backstory and then dying immediately was fucking hilarious. I’m gonna go out on a limb and say this was filming on the lot next door to The Lost City Weirdest Fiji water ad I’ve ever seen.  

And I’ve seen some weird ones Some movies have a Chekov’s Gun, this movie has a Chekov’s Machine Gun. Just one set up after another for later. 

I really enjoyed this movie. Just pure dumb fun. It was like Magnolia, John Wick, and Baccano all on a train. I thought Brad Pitt would be the White Death since the girl mentions the White death uses the weapon of his assassin to kill them. Brad Pitt used each assassins' weapon against them. > Kicking a dude’s ass

> attendant walks by, gives you water

> make dude whose ass you’re kicking buy it for you

Chad Pitt Honestly, I laughed every time Thomas the Tank Engine got brought up I'm loving the Pitt-Bullock-Tatum 2022 Cinematic Universe SNAKE

DON'T 

OPEN To me the biggest twist - Karen Fukuhara character is really just an ordinary train staff I love that Sony was willing to make this a bit more of a spectacle. Spending $90 million on an R-rated action movie doesn’t happen too much anymore unless it’s a superhero movie with a built-in audience. Even John Wick 3 “only” cost $75 million. And it pays off. This really feels like a proper blockbuster, especially the third act, but it also gets to indulge in bloody mayhem. 

And the whole thing’s a lot of fun. The action’s great, almost every joke lands, and I really enjoyed the colorful cast of characters. The cameos were a lot of fun too. I should’ve seen most of them coming, but I didn’t.

I hope this does well. I’d gladly watch a sequel or prequel, but failing that, I’d just like more R-rated action movies in theaters with a respectable budget behind them. Never have I had such a deep philosophical connection to Thomas the Tank Engine than I did whenever Lemon brought them up. 

Movie was way more fun than it really seemed, even if the trailers did give away a lot. It’s totally worth a viewing Is this…like a sex thing? Made a joke comment, but forreal this was so much fun. I laughed a lot, was surprised a lot, and just enjoyed watching great actors have fun. Loved the humor, loved the changes in tone, loved the interconnected story, and most of all I loved the train wreck. A good train wreck is a good movie in my book 👍🏾 haven’t seen a good train wreck in a hot minute. Shout out to good train wrecks. Got to be one of my favorite genres of movies. i did not expect the climax of bullet train and shrek 2 to both rock out to holding out for a hero but here we are! They should make a spin-off with tangerine and lemon Brad pitt, Sandra bullock, and Channing Tatum. They filmed this at the same time as Lost City hahaha. 

Went into this thinking it would just be okay but it was top five movies of the year so far for me. Acting was fantastic of course, and the plot was simple and satisfying. That white girl tears joke sent me. This movie was a blast. Man  I’m bummed Aron Taylor Johnson didn’t make it Was Ryan Reynolds suppose to play Brad Pitt's role or something, but couldn't due to scheduling conflicts or something? Even Pitt's dialogue was Reynold-esque How is Brad Pitt still so hot. Men will literally destroy an entire city with a bullet train before going to therapy It’s crazy that going into this you’re thinking, this will be a nice tight one-location little movie with some cool fight scenes probably, and then in comes the third act with cgi trains crashing all over the place and Brad Pitt flying in slowmo through a huge cgi spinning background.  
Shit gets nuts. Was pretty good. Tangerine and Lemon made this movie. What a brilliant dynamic. Each of them stole the movie. This is going to be an easy rewatchable film that will age well. It’s just too much absurd fun and it knows it. 

It gets a little too much near the end with the derailing of the train but who cares. Shit was awesome. ",0,Bullet Train
11," My favorite part was when the special forces captain was tasked with managing traffic lol The most unrealistic part (aside from the troll, of course) was the sudden sunrise. It was pitch black, then BAM! Sun. Whatever happened to the 2+ hours of twilight before sunrise? I gotta read that book about the monk who throws his head at his enemies to bite them. And finger darts Why was she acting like her dad was an idiot for thinking it was a troll?  I mean what the fuck did they think the giant creature that came out of the mountain was? So how exactly did they manage to kill the troll family? The main troll was practically indestructible Just like the Godzilla reboot… more monster, less human element. I like Troll Hunter much better. It's hilarious that while literally looking at a video of a troll multiple people in the room laugh at the idea of it being a creature and still try to say gas explosion.

Even worse, when weaknesses from fairy tales are brought up, another guy laughs and calls it ridiculous. Literally mocks them for bringing up fairy tales despite seeing a mythical creature with his own eyes.

Imagine if in Independence day after the ships wiped out the major cities if some guy who saw it happened starting scoffing at the idea of Aliens and called people nuts for bringing them up. That's similar to what a few characters did in this movie.

Also.....why did they consistently fly their helicopters in range of the troll's grasp? It's extremely slow and there is no reason to get that close to it, yet they're constantly right near its head. On behalf of all Norwegians I just want to assure everyone this is not how we treat our trolls. Why are mine workers always dying in movies? What the fuck is hypernature This was infuriating tbh. The main girl scoffs at the scientists that don't believe it could be some big ass animal, then immediately does the same to her dad even though she sought him out for help. Then every human in the movie who is staring a literal troll in the face refuses to entertain anything. It's just stupid incompetence all the way down and I couldn't take the movie seriously. Just dumb and bad writing. I mean the main girl saw the troll come out of camouflage right in front of her damn eyes and still is like ""stop calling it a troll, gosh do you know how dumb and crazy you sound?"". Bleh, I turned it off 2/3 of the way in as it just refused to improve. I was on the Troll’s side. Fuck humanity, you just murder a bunch of baby trolls in their own home, then leave one alive to use as bait to lure the poor heartbroken dad into the mountains to die. Poor baby troll skull with the big crack in it. 

Then you have the balls to build your own palace on top of the scene of a child massacre “for luck”. Bastards. 

Honestly apart from negligent property damage and the initial mountain explosion, he didn’t even do any damage without being provoked first! He was just a dad mourning his dead kids, and trying to go home.

I thought this film was going to go deeper into folklore and harmonising with nature. Instead we just got Norwegian Godzilla. Well, this surpassed my expectations I could say that at least. But I did set my expectations extremely low. And that's coming from someone who watched the original Troll Hunter.  
  
Also the thing that bothered me the most in isn't even troll related at all, its how someone >!managed to hack into a F-35 nuclear missile launch system and weapon system with a lone laptop!<. 
  
Overall its a decently entertaining enough popcorn flick. Okay the scene where her father dies is some bullshit just to drive the plot forward. Soldier is on the 50 cal, watches it walk through an artillery barrage, and that dude thinks,” Yeah imma shoot it with my machine gun that’ll do some damage.” It was a nice addition to the trollverse but still troll hunter rocks. Maybe because Troll Hunter is a found footage light horror movie combined with incredible landscapes and folk lores.  
I liked Troll overall but it seemed to me like a military demonstration ad from the first minutes when F35 appeared. Then came the moment with the president's assistant asked the soldier about the helmet or the vision goggles. The movie started filming in Semptember 2021 so i cant say that they wanted to show that they are such a powerhouse that we show top planes even on netflix movies cause we do not care about aggressors (Russia lets say) and also we have such a bugdet that we can . But if this holds and they combined two things in a netflix movie, science fiction and some kind of demostration, i still do not think that hacking a F35 in less than a minute, even for a science fiction movie, seems good for that purpose. Anywayy, i am looking forward to the sequel. Holy fuck, what did I just watch? Genuine question for any Norwegians, was this satire? 

I honestly felt sorry for the poor bastard… blown out of a mountain, pelted with all sorts for 330km then has his dead baby’s skull thrown off the back of a vintage truck moments before he’s petrified to death while enduring both severe emotional and physical pain.

Comments here cheered me up. Thanks Reddit. I was totally on board with this movie and had turned my brain off and was just vibing and having a good time. 

…and then some random government employee casually hacks into a fighter jet that is hauling what is implied to be some sort of nuclear or chemical weapon. Literally made me completely detach from the film. 

Some quick points:

-Why was that one soldier (Kris) conveniently exactly where he needed to be to progress the story at all times? It was almost like whoever was in charge of his assignments was having a text convo with Nora so he could line their schedules up.

-Why did the military-trained helicopter pilots not consider for even a second that flying within arms reach of a bipedal, humanoid monster while actively pissing it off was a stupid fucking idea? 

-Why did everyone continue to act like her dad was a nutjob when he was so clearly and obviously 100% correct about what was going on?

-Why did she even bring her dad, the “troll guy”, in on this if she didn’t think it was a troll and was just gonna be a fucking asshole to him about it the whole time up until he literally dies?

-Why did a trained soldier see not even two minutes beforehand that full-blown artillery fire didn’t even phase this thing and then decide to fire his mounted machine gun at it? What did he think that was going to do?

-How did asshole government guy instantly know who “hacked” the plane? Furthermore, that implies that he already knew she may able to do that and he just…let her keep working there? Okay…

-Why did Nora have no issue with the fact that the royal guy admitted they gaslit her dad into a mental institution and ruined his life for nothing?

-Why was the advisor to the PM able to just leave freely with his credentials and security badge after quitting his job and then use those items to bypass security checks and the police multiple times without a single person noticing?

-Why did the government continue to absolutely refuse to acknowledge the whole “troll” thing when literally every piece of evidence was screaming “ITS A FUCKING TROLL”?

-Why did they decide to use men with rifles to guard Oslo after clearly seeing multiple times that even their heaviest artillery fire didn’t even phase this thing? That’s sending your men to a certain death.

-Why did they spend so much time at the beginning of the film highlighting the creature’s footprints (AND THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY FOOTPRINTS), and yet not a single person was like ‘anybody else think these look like footprints?’.

-Why did they spend so much time on the whole “hypernature” bullshit when it literally amounted to nothing and was never mentioned again. “Wow. You smell that?” “It smells like outside.” “Yeah. But it’s EXTRA outside.”  …fucking what Nora?

-Why did they not try to “trip” or subdue the troll in any way whatsoever and just continued trying to shoot and bomb it even after it’s become painfully obvious that that doesn’t work?

-Why did Nora make a point of proving that UV light turns troll bones to stone and then not take a video of that and have the guy she’s with who has a direct line to the PM send that confirmed evidence of a valid weakness/strategy to the government…and instead decide to try and fight the thing with an old pickup truck?

-What was the point of psychologically torturing the troll by baiting it with its kids skull? That was so fucked up that it made me wish the troll would just step on her. What a fucking dick move. There were 10,000 ways to make that troll chase you, and you bring it the skull of its murdered child? Jesus Christ, who is the real monster of this movie?

-Why was Nora even brought onboard in the first place? She’s a paleontologist, not a geologist or seismologist. The fact that they wanted a paleontologist implies that they already knew they were dealing with some kind of ancient life form, and yet when she arrives everyone in the room is like “why is there a fossil scientist here?” I DON’T KNOW GUYS, YOU ARE THE ONES WHO SENT FOR HER WHY DON’T YOU TELL US? Why tf do the trolls have humanoid skeletons when they're just made of heavy rocks? They leave no biological trace or some bs, because they're just rocks with sentience from the mountain, yet they have BONE SKELETONS? Not to mentionthat they would crack and break under the constant weight of grinding rocks, it makes zero sense when you consider the way they've presented the idea of the creature.. ""Troll"" gets a 5/10 from me. I had some fun with it and I don't regret watching it, but you won't miss much if you skip it.

The positives:

* likeable characters
* some nice references (Jurassic Park, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings)
* effects aren't amazing, but they look adequate to good for the most part

The negatives:

* very derivative (borrows heavily from Roland Emmerich's Godzilla, for example)
* Some plot points don't make a lot of sense: why do they insist on not calling it a troll? Why do they attack the troll even though they know nothing about his intentions?
* The troll doesn't get much in terms of characterization. It was enough for me to feel sorry for him in the end, but I would've liked some more exploration into the lore.

I'm surprised noboby has commented on Sam Neill's cameo yet. Or was that not him as the reporter from ""CNZ""? >Don’t say the word *Troll*.

Tf else are we going to call it? A Giant? May as well call it a Troll, then.

Lady, Papa knows what he’s talking about. You had seen a dadgum giant footprint just the day before. I thought it was awesome. 

Did just what I wanted out of a movie about a Troll coming out of a mountain!

Good times. Shit movie was shit. Just finished watching.

To be honest it was  huge disappointment.

They were able to fit basically all cliches of american movies into this one. From the scientist called as consultant that saves the world against everyone else, passing thriugh the old crazy guy that knows the truth, to the nerdy guy/girl that manages to hack into a nuclear bomber... Admittedly, I fell asleep twice whilst watching and had to rewind several times to make sure I didn’t miss something important, but did they ever explain why the Troll could turn to stone now despite having been in daylight earlier in the film? Why is catpain kris' name funny? ",0,Troll
12," This was the most dumb fun I’ve had in a long time at a movie. David Harbour was very believable as the disaffected Santa with a warrior past. I love unconventional Christmas movies and this really delivered. Great homages to Die Hard, Home Alone, Bad Santa, and a little Silent Night, Deadly Night. This will be a repeat in seasons to come. Hope y’all enjoy! Santa Claus is coming to town! I liked how Santa used the naughty list to keep track of how many bad guys were left. This holiday special of Righteous Gemstones was great. There's plenty of praise for Harbor, so I'll throw some in for John Leguizamo.

He was an absolute riot as basically a big ass kid who hates Christmas. It's as if they told him, ""Your character is completely ridiculous through and through,  UT please play him straight""

The dude is just a straight up childish sociopath who is fixated on Christmas.

And though they didn't talk about it, one of his misdeeds that got him on the naughty list was that he ""killed his best friend"".

I really enjoyed the movie for what it was. My wife and I laughed hysterically when the dad said Santa isn't real and the dumb actor guy was all surprised ""If you randomly kill one of us, how do you know you won't kill the person who knows about the money?""

That was the line of the fucking movie. Scrooge was so fucking mad lmao. That Christmas dies tonight line had me in tears in the theater Much better than I assumed it would be, and a really great surprise to start the holidays.

Saw it with my wife, who normally dislikes action movies but likes both Christmas movies and David Harbor, but she really liked it too.

The main hammer scene was hilarious and had some awesome action, the final chimney kill was glorious and pretty metal, and the Home Alone scene was what I've always wanted.

It's not a perfect movie, but for this type of movie, it's one of the best in its class. I was worried it would try to be ""so bad it's good,"" but it never really went in that direction.

It's essentially a Hallmark Christmas movie for adults who like Home Alone, Die Hard, and splatter flicks. As someone who also likes Hallmark movies (I know I know,) it was a lot of fucking fun.

The action was great, the gore was very good (although I always wish for practical effects in these movies, but it was still very well done,) and the comedy nearly always landed. The theater was laughing pretty loudly at the jokes and kills which made it extra fun.

Plus, actually seeing a badass Viking Santa is kinda what I needed this season.

If you dig the concept, you'll likely enjoy it. Much better than I thought it'd be, and definitely something I'll watch again in the future 

Recommended Holy shit Trudy with the best kill of the movie Mr Scrooge's death might be my favorite movie death ever I really enjoyed this movie. It’s like an awesome mash up of Die Hard and Home Alone and it does it super well. David Harbor was perfect as Santa, action was awesome, John Leguizamo was hilarious as Scrooge, jokes were funny and it also has a surprisingly wholesome story. I walked out of the theater smiling. I will definitely rewatch this.

Also the Die Hard reference was great. “Die Hard on blu ray, fuck!” What happened to the woman who was cracking the safe? Did she get a death scene or did she completely disappear?

Also I was convinced that the reindeer left to go get Mrs Clause so she could save the day. They mentioned her so much I'm surprised we never saw her. This exactly the kind of movie I want to watch during the holidays. Lots of fun and gore for the entire family. David Harbour was such a badass Santa! 8/10 The trap scene made me realize how much I would love an R-rated Home Alone. I was truly laughing at that man’s pain Now we need the Santa Skullcrusher origin story. Santa decapitating a man with an ice skate is beautiful. I honestly don't get the hate in some of the lower comments. Once the setup was over and the action started it was pretty consistent. It was campy in all the best ways. So many homages to different Christmas movies that were done really well. I guess to each their own Did anyone notice the Easter Egg at the very beginning? The food catering van had its business name on the side: “Farkus and Dill”. Scut Farkus and Grover Dill were the bullies in A Christmas Story. I am so sad my theater was almost empty. This movie was everything I wanted it to be and a little bit more I loved it! As all of the advertising has said, this film is ""Die Hard"" meets ""Home Alone"" and it strikes a middle-ground between those two movies perfectly.

David Harbor makes an excellent Santa Claus. Not only does he look great, but the way he plays it - as a man who's tired of the way the world has changed and, as such, is at the end of his rope - is so well done. He's essentially an R-Rated version of Season One's Hopper from ""Stranger Things"", which I guess is why they cast him. But the ARC he goes on - learning to believe in Christmas and himself again with the help of that little girl? It's great. This movie has way more \*heart\* than I was expecting, and I think that's what's going to make this a perennial holiday favorite/rewatch of people for years to come.

Not only is there tons of action and tons of heart though, but the humor is spot on, the cast is great, and the music - both the original score and classic score - is utilized in such a fantastic manner.

Look is it a masterpiece? No. But it's a hell of a lot of \*fun\*, and if you're a fan of movies like ""Die Hard"" and ""Lethal Weapon"", you'll love it.

It's definitely going into \*my\* Christmas canon! I was losing it this whole movie. So funny and honestly the action scenes were better than I thought they’d be. Could’ve cut down on some of the rich annoying family but thats alright. PLEASE give this a sequel where Mr and Mrs Claus have to defend the north pole homefront from terrorists or something. Fuck it, make Winona Mrs Claus and let them go apeshit Watching Santa stitch up a knife wound with gift wrap was the cherry on top. This movie will become a Christmas classic.

Its like they sat down with a whiteboard, and wrote out all the great things from christmas movies in the past. Then put it all into one hilarious package.

The film doesn't take it self seriously, and once you realise it is absurd, for the sake of absurdity you settle into what I feel, is one of the best comedies of the last five years.

Skullcrusher! I want to add, that first scene set in Bristol, England is the worst representation of the city ever. Hilarious scene but the place looks nothing like that.

Source: I live here I loved the movie. I didn’t expect it to be such a traditional Christmas movie though. I was expecting just John Wick with a Christmas setting, but it was more a Christmas Movie staring John Wick. Side note. The phrase “x dies tonight” is forever ruined for me. When he said “Christmas dies tonight” all I could think of was “**EVIL DIES TONIGHT**” ",0,Violent Night
13," Tyler cooking his shitty meal was like me every time I get my Hello Fresh box.

I am also, incidentally, from Grand Island, Nebraska. ""Where did you go to college?""

""Brown.""

""Did you have any student loans?""

""No""

""I'm sorry, you're dying"" ""My eyes are bigger than my stomach. Can I get to rest to go?""

Well played. I thought it was interesting at the end the wife motioned for her to leave as they all seemed to accept their fate with her being the most deep in in the last moments . They truly made no efforts to leave and the doors technically weren’t even locked. I kinda did think it was funny when “Margo” ordered a cheeseburger if one by one they all ordered a less bombastic meal and started to enjoy the meal for what it is then what it was suppose to represent and I guess die eating as the “common” people lol I’d like to give a shout out to the guy who plays the sommelier. A bit part, but he was giving 100%. Ok I need to see it again and pay attention to the kitchen staff to see if the chef who plays the cop was in the kitchen from the beginning. There is a line where Anya calls out Hoult for not even attempting to get one of the staffs names, which makes me think the cop actor was in the background the whole time, but no one cared to notice. I've never made the realization that a real world class chef might despise people who obsess over the craft but are not chefs themselves, seeing them as people who peak around the curtain and take the magic out of it while not putting in the work themselves.  It might feel that their work is diminished because fans think they could do it just as well them (until he puts Hoult's character on the spot and he fails miserably)

Could be the director is also making the same statement with directors and cinephiles?  This also works with the chef and food critics vs directors and movie critics Got him with the old reverse-Ratatouille. Excuse me, can I have some actual bread now? Hong Chau is the secret MVP of this film. TACOOO TUESDAYY The :30 rant that Ralph Fiennes gives to John Leguizamo is one of the funniest things I’ve heard all year. Anya Taylor-Joy ate The fact that this dude's last film was over a decade ago AND it was a fucking Rom-Com starring Chris Evans & Anna Faris is wrinkling my brain.

(Edit: Yes, I know he is also responsible for Shameless which helps bridge the gap. The fact he goes from THAT film to this though shows so much growth.) I feel this would be a good double feature with Triangle of Sadness for some reason. This got lots of laugh from me, I especially loved the absurdity of the menu descriptions on screen. Tyler’s character was so hatable in the end, but I found myself laughing at his reactions the most. I like how things are going completely off the rails and he’s still obsessing over the food.

The setting of the island was beautiful, there were some great shots of the land and sea. The score was a nice surprise and the swelling choral finale was fitting for how satirical the movie was.

A really fun movie with some great supporting actors. The cheeseburger did look amazing though.

edit: please read the u/CanyonSlim comment below, it deserves top billing on this thread One thing I really liked was that the movie didn't cop out by making us feel like the victims deserved their fate.  They weren't particularly likable, but their sins were relatively minor (adultury, financial fraud).  And as proven with the actor, the sentence of death could be given quite arbitrarily.  Plus their were several people completely innocent (the wife, the assistant, the editor).  But they were killed due to guilt by association.

The only one who was truly reprehensible and deserving of death was Tyler, for willingly leading Margo into mortal danger. 

This may be a dark comedy, but it in no way endorses what the chef did. The best way I can describe the tension I felt throughout the movie is that I thought any moment somebody's head was gonna get blown off mid conversation. 

I also like that there is no cannibalism angle in the movie. That would've been a basic as fuck revelation. Between this and The Great, Nicholas Hoult is really good at playing dickheads it seems.

Anya and Fiennes were unsurprisingly great as well. She's not wrong. That cheeseburger was the best-looking and tastiest meal, and he probably knew it judging by that smile he kept giving when making it. This was demented I love it. My former acting coach was the fake cop shocked the hell out of me Why was Tyler taking pictures if he knew they were going to die?  🤔 Yeah that was great.  Not sure what else to add.  Sure am glad I didn’t watch a preview before hand but just a beautifully crafted movie My favourite line of the whole thing was when Sloewik commented on Tyler's shallot dicing technique What is everyone’s thoughts on Katherine, the chef who came up with the idea of everyone dying? She became very emotional and I couldn’t tell exactly if it was because she was exhausted/relieved for everything to end or if it was because of something else? ",0,The Menu
14," I thought it was adorable. 

I mean, most Christmas movies aren't super great critically speaking. I really enjoyed this one though, it will likely join my regular holiday rotation. I'm a sucker for musicals, so this one was perfect for me and what I'm looking for in a Christmas movie.

My current must-watch Christmas movies are Elf, Home Alone, Nightmare Before Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street, Noelle (cheesy, but, I loved it anyways), Klaus and now also Spirited. 

I have my must watch list, but, I usually fill it out with some others I don't need to see every year, like The Santa Clause, Peanuts Christmas, Scrooged, Muppet Christmas and so on. I never would have watched it on my own volition, but my wife put it on while I was “working from home”. And I stopped working and watched the whole thing, cried a bit, laughed a lot. 

The physical humour they both added was the perfect touch. 

Fun movie :) I really enjoyed this. I went in with low expectations and was surprised. I called some stuff that was going to happen at the end (specifically with Ryan’s character). The musical numbers weren’t that bad either, but did remind me a hell of a lot of ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ with the numbers. Wonder if anyone from that show-like the writers or a producer-worked on this film as well. At least there are loads of good shows on Apple TV  Serverance is a must , Ted Lasso, Slow Horses , Blackbird , Bad Sisters  are all really good This was just a good Christmas movie. Fun musical. Just finished it with my wife, we loved it, beginning to end. Great musical numbers and top notch production, ton of great jokes, 5/5, will watch again. I absolutely loved it I loved it. It's fun and sweet. I really enjoyed the concept and the songs. It made me smile and honestly I felt better after watching it. I wasn't anticipating it at all!  I remember Will and Ryan did that viral TikTok singing trend and was wondering what movie it was a promo for.  When the movie started as a musical I was like ""oh, geeze, not again..."" lol like ""not another holiday musical"" and it's almost like they knew I would be watching.  It was a GREAT movie, a wonderful surprised, unexpected little turns of events, and I've seen it four times now.  It did leave me with some questions, but not enough to make me think it was terrible.  LOVED it. 

There were a lot of moral opinions in it that some may live against so I could see how that could turn someone off.  Also, it's a bit of a departure from Will Ferrell's usual stuff which is difficult for people to see - there's less slap stick.  And... idk, I've only ever really seen Ryan Reynolds in Van Wilder a million years ago and I stan his relationship with Blake.  So I guess if you're into his more recent films (and he's a terrible dancer haha), this is a departure from that as well. OP I googled “Spirited Reddit” and this post came up. It appears me and you are the only ones who didn’t like it lol. I expected more from Ryan Reynolds and Will Farrell. Way too much music even for a musical imo. I had to turn it off with 40 minutes left. It was okay I guess. I liked the concept much better than the film itself.

And I feel it was very front-heavy with the fast paced and loud songs like it was desperately trying to grab our attention, total sensory overload.
And I guess the filmmakers felt that way too because they deleted one song number.

I think they could've simplified the plot and maybeee not made it a musical? Could've fixed the pacing and giving more time for better character moments? Idk, just spitballing here. Musicals aren't very great. Will Ferrell could've been in something far far better It's cringe. Movie definitely sucked. Couldn’t get through it. >Personally I got absolutely nothing out of this movie.

This pretty much sums it up perfectly.

One of the most forgettable films I think I've ever seen Watched it yesterday but barely paid attention to it. Accidentally found it online by specifically searching for it. I didn't want to sign up for another service. And I found a perfect copy and boy did it kind of Indifferently suck. I had to fast forward through all the singing , to even finish it .  This could’ve been so much better had they not put all the bad band bad songs in it . Spoiler alert: but did anyone else think it was a bit much that Clint’s worst memory was when he didn’t want to take in his sister’s kid? He knew he wasn’t capable of raising a kid/acknowledged his own selfish reasons for not wanting a kid. That’s a huge ask of anyone. Relatable imo. And it’s not like the girl went to foster care or something, the younger brother (her other uncle) took her in. And apparently, gave her a loving home. If the younger brother hadn’t existed or said no, I feel like it’d be different. I just kinda hated that plot point My husband and I had high hopes and we were disappointed. The songs weren’t catchy at all and it was way too long. Loved it, definitely a new classic Christmas movie Just watched, I liked the idea and the cast but it was way too long... Could have been at least 30 minutes shorter. It's like they filmed way too many musical numbers and then just decided to keep all of them. Cringe the musical. Probably won't see it, especially if it's not on a service I already have. The commercials didn't do anything for me; I wasn't sure it was real because Ryan and Will in a Carol remake seemed like a strange concept. 

Only Carols I watch for Christmas are Scrooged and The Muppets. That fact that I never see “it’s a wonderful life” on lists anymore is so depressing to me.

To me, it encapsulates the spirit Christmas and the human condition.

It is THE quintessential Christmas movie. ",0,Spirited
15," Lots of foreshadowing for deaths here:

- Wayne saying “peoples eyes will pop out their heads when they see this” and then gets his eyes pulled out with a pitchfork.

- Bobby Lynn is first seen walking out of a building showing a blonde woman having her swimwear ripped off by an alligator

- Jackson mentioning how farmers pointed their guns at him back in Vietnam

- Howard mentioning his weak heart several times.

- There’s a shot of the van’s tires running though the cow guts at the start that looks near identical to a shot of the van tires running over Pearl’s head when Maxine kills her.

Great movie. Loved Mia Goth, Kid Cudi and Jenna Ortega but Brittany Snow stole the movie for me. My man had to videotape his own forced cuckolding and then got stabbed 30 times in the throat.  Poor RJ, all he wanted to do is elevate porn. I’ve never seen a dong shadow get such a hearty laugh, truly an accomplishment

EDIT: make sure to stay till the end of the credits I feel so stupid that I didn't realize the lead actress played the old lady too until I looked it up after the movie. The body in the basement had his picture on the milk carton, right?

Also, I didn’t realize that was Kid Cudi until like 20 minutes in. I’m glad to see him get more acting gigs. I died laughing at that ending. I loved how the killers both died such anti-climatic deaths that they caused on themselves. The shot of Pearl getting flown backwards after firing the double barrel shotgun was especially hilarious. What zero dick does to an mf. I’m obsessed with the opening shot that used the door frame to establish the shot at 4:3 (and therefore the 70’s tone) and pulled back to 2.35:1. Brilliantly shot. The “Now that’s what I call divine intervention!” scene had the entire theater laughing. Great way to ease the tension after that climax! I loved the movie and especially the 70’s aesthetic. But damn it, I missed the trailer for Pearl. I had no idea it’d have something after the credits The message of the movie: watch out for horny old people Great art has a way of reframing your perspective. For instance, I thought I was having a bad day until I saw the cameraman watch his girlfriend get fucked on camera before being propositioned then brutally murdered by a 90 year old hillbilly.

Really makes you appreciate the little things Up to the Fleetwood Mac part, I thought this movie was gonna be a sad melodrama about getting old instead of a horror movie Old lady was dancing just like Joker. That ended up being the most unsexy movie I may have ever seen Chekov's Gator That opening shot, framed looking out through the farm door mimicing the 16 mm films 4:3 aspect ratio? Good shit. X really left me feeling conflicted. The idea of sexually confused and frustrated old people going homicidal against a crew of liberated youth is really interesting. The first half had terrific atmosphere. It was horny, it was induced with dread (that aerial shot of Maxine being stalked by the alligator was chilling) and it really seemed to be setting you up for something deliriously intense in the second half. But I felt like the intensity of the film bottomed out as soon as Pearl started stabbing people and it became more of a tongue in cheek grindhouse throwback. Still bolstered by an interesting idea, but not quite what the first half of the movie seemed to promise.

That said, Pearl's dance in red light from of the blood-drenched van headlights was a thing of macabre beauty. Martin Henderson (Wayne) was really channeling McConaughey in this This is a really fun throwback to old exploitation movies. Beautifully shot, outstanding soundtrack (inject Kid Cudi humming over Fleetwood Mac directly into my veins), and some really fun kills. Also further proof that there is nothing scarier than a horny old person. Missing Person ad on the milk carton is the guy in the cellar. The Texas Grandmaw Massacre For a second I thought it was Robert Englund playing the pastor on TV. It was obvious the old man would die from his heart from the foreshadowing, but the way it happened was an absolute riot. Doing a line is an appropriate response to waking up and finding a creepy woman fondling you in bed. ",0,X
16," I was a bit confused, when Okoye was fighting Namors soldiers on the street she stabbed them with mortal wounds and they healed instantly, but when Nakia shot them rescuing Shuri they died and couldn’t heal. What’s the deal? Namor casually giving Shuri a water suit of someone he probably killed painfully and removed their body from was pretty morbidly funny The Ironheart suit looked too much like Baymax. I hope they give her a suit that looks like the comics in the show. 

The Midnight Angel suits made me think of Rowlet (the pokemon) and once I saw it I couldn't unsee it. Their design could've been better. 

I would've liked to see Shurri in action as Black Panther more. The final battle felt kind of rushed. 

The Ross and Elaine stuff felt shoehorned in to set up Thunderbolts. They could have cut that stuff and saved it for the TB movie. 

And minor gripe, but it did feel kinda weird that none of the other Avengers were there for T'Challa's funeral. I get the logistics of why they weren't in the movie but just having Bucky, Sam, Pepper, etc off to the side wearing white for the procession would have been nice. 

On the positive side Namor looked cool as hell and I'm impressed they pulled off his wings/flying without it looking super goofy. Talokan looked super cool too. And I dug how it parralled Wakanda. The acting was also really great. 

And ""Oh shit she has an Ironman suit"" is my new official favorite piece of dialog from an MCU movie The amount of time that the production team spent on Okoye's suit was the same amount of time it took Shuri and Riri to find Namor's weakness. This movie is another example of when serving the greater universe interrupts the current movie. Riri is a plot device, that was evidently inserted because she'll be getting a Disney plus show. Fine, but the story surrounding her character....why is Namor trying to kill her when the CIA already has her machine? Are they really implying that the CIA wouldn't record the work she did? It doesn't matter if u kill her when the technology is already out there lol. Also why is she still JUST in school when she's basically made the most important invention in modern history? Lol So there was vibranium in the coast of the Mayan empire but it was never discovered by western civilization? (Besides Namor's mom's tribe) I’m going to need a reacting gif of mbaku seeing all of those people on the whale So the Wakandans only brought one *boat?* For a technologically advanced nation, why didn't they use something like a helicarrier or anything that didn't need to touch the surface of the water? 


Also, what happened to all their pew pew spears that theu used in infinity war? 


Idk why but I was siding with Namor and his people. Namor was like ""Hit me on the shell when you ready."" When Namor returned to land to bury his mother and said what he saw was more than he could comprehend, I legit thought we were gonna see a Starbucks. ""I think AI might be the end of us all""

""AI is not like the movies mother.""

*They literally live in a universe where an AI almost took over the world* Shuri might be the skinniest superhero. Okoye’s suit made her look like Sonic ANGELA BASSETT IS 64???!!!! Angela Bassett killed it as Ramonda. The scene where she yells at Okoye felt so raw Hold up, so the Queen went to Haiti to ask the mother of her grand child to go on a deep dive rescue op leaving her child and the future heir to Wakanda alone?


Listen I know a good ole fashioned orphaning is a way to make a good superhero but that seems pretty drastic My biggest gripe with the movie that’s not being mentioned here is how this completely does away with what we walked away from in Black Panther 1. Killmonger was the eye opener to how shitty it was of Wakanda to close its borders and turn their back on the world. While blacks were first slaves then eventually treated like 2nd hand citizens, Wakanda did nothing, and Killmonger came for revenge. Well fricken T’Challa recognized this BS from the elders in the ancestral plane, slap their bitch-asses and said No More. His whole character growth in that movie was realizing that his cousin wasn’t exactly wrong in his thinking but that he was wrong in his execution. 

But nah Black Panther 2 is like fuck that, fuck humans, fuck France for some reason and fuck the world, we’re just gonna forget that ever happened and share nothing with y’all. What an awesome way to honor T’Challas passing by just forgetting what he stood for. Just ignoring it entirely actually in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

Namor was badass though. Needed him for like 45m instead of the 10 we got with him. PSA: there is no end credits scene, only a mid-credits scene Looks like Shuri should've listened to Okoye about that Midnight Angel suit lol Makes me wonder what the original script with Chadwick was supposed to be like. Did Okoye kill Martin freeman’s guards? I can never tell if they are killing or temporarily knocking people unconscious Star of the movie was Lupita’s side profile. ""I had to build a quantum computer to decrypt the security code I wrote""

Okay what the actual fuck are you talking about Ironheart Namor is a fucking badass mans was EURO STEPPING IN THE SKY If that final fight was Namor weakened then him at full strength is insane. His action was very well done, the way he moved was so unique, pushing off his winged feet and changing direction so quick in the air, but still feeling weighted and strong was very cool to see.

17," The kid who voiced pinocchio was phenomenal Watched with my 6yo, she prefers this so much more than the Tom hanks one I loved every minute. The stop motion animation is mind-blowing.

I also love how an actress like Cate Blanchett wanted in even though she does not say a word. 

I watched the bts video on Netflix right after and made me appreciate it a 1000x more. I was not prepared to face my own mortality today. “What happens happens, and then we are gone.” New sentence unlocked:

“The stop motion monkey fading out of existence broke my heart” The running gag of Ewan McGregor being horribly maimed whenever he tried to sing his song was hilarious every time to me Was not expecting to see Pinocchio get drafted to be an Italian Fascist Super Soldier. This film was absolutely phenomenal and Disney should be absolutely embarrassed by what they put out this year in comparison.

There are many aspects to this film I legit love more than the actual original which is one of my top 3 Disney movies. The fact that Del Toro got Cate Blanchett to do nothing but make monkey noises for this film is absolutely hilarious Voice cast really shines, and the look and visual art direction is just beautiful. I could look at screen shots of this movie all day.

Also thought it was funny how Pinocchio was kind of janky looking with random bent nails sticking out because Geppetto was wasted AF when he made him lol. I dig Pinocchio being an Immortal wandering the Earth like a Highlander Casting Tom Kenny as Mussolini is so funny. This movie was fucking wonderful Guillermo del Toro's love of horror and dark fantasy made him a perfect director for an adaptation of Carlo Collodi's The Adventures of Pinocchio because while it strays heavily from the source material it does have the same dark and disturbing elements of Colliodi's story, of course, what makes this version of Pinocchio so great is the decision to make it a stop-motion animated film - a puppet playing a puppet seems like a no-brainer - but with Guillermo's darker tale you also get a heartbreaking story about love and loss and the relationship between a father and a son. 

Overall, Guillermo del Toro's *Pinocchio* is a brilliant piece of filmmaking and a true work of art that really tugs at the heartstrings and makes for a great companion piece to his other dark fantasy film *Pan's Labyrinth*. I liked it a lot. Especially enjoyed the Death character. I think the movie really needed something to change pinocchio’s perspective a bit, and it came at the perfect time. The ending was very well done as well. “I just wanted to bring you joy.”

“And you did. Such terrible, terrible joy.”

Excuse me for a moment while I weep in the corner over there. I adored this movie. It’s so overflowing with heart and that’s such a welcome relief from the mostly soulless empty franchise films we get these days. So glad I saw it on the big screen.  
  
David Bradley is amazing. Walder Frey killed it as Geppetto Damn, man. I was weeping uncontrollably at the end. I had to just sob for a minute.

I can’t imagine watching this movie as a child much less at 35 lol. 

The music, animation, writing were all at master levels. I can’t express how much I love Del Toro’s films. I was eagerly anticipating this and it didn’t disappoint at all. Incredible that Del Toro’s version of Pinocchio it’s one of the years best movies and Disney’s version it’s probably the worst movie of the year. I saw this in theaters several weeks ago. Maybe the most beautiful stop motion animation I've ever seen and so wonderfully imaginative. Completely blows the Disney remake out of the water.

I thought the ending was very interesting, with Pinocchio remaining a puppet and outliving the other characters before deciding to go out into the world. Geppetto cut down a tree, and made a puppet in a night WHILE drunk and depressed. And all I managed to do today was get the motivation to watch The Fabelmans Loved it! Only minor nitpick is that I wish we got some closure with Candlewick at the end but perhaps something is going over my head with his character. Other than that I thought it was fantastic and thought Del Toro took things in a really interesting direction. The Jesus/Christian symbolism was a really nice touch and I think this film was pretty heavy at points despite largely being a children's movie. Well worth the wait! Visually this movie was really beautifully made. But aside from that it's also fantastic in every facet. The Wood Sprite basically being the blue woman DMT entity really touched me and I cried like a newborn at the ending. This movie is seriously incredible and as someone who grew up watching the original Pinocchio movie decades ago this is such a great retelling for a more mature adult audience. Might be a Top 10 movie of all time for me easily. ",0,Pinnochio

19," I thought it was a solid 7/10. 

I’ve rewatched it a few times now. It had some low points but Scuts redemption and the ending really tied the movie up well. Very heavy on nostalgia but why wouldn’t it be? It’s sweet & funny, and it just feels right. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. You can tell a lot of love went into it. Some big laughs, along with some big tears. Heavy on the flashbacks (many of them unnecessary) and voice over narration, but it’s worth your time. 7.5/10 It was absolutely perfect.  I can't wait to watch it again 30 times this year.  I'm not kidding.  😐 It was fine but would have been a lot better if they didn't recast Mrs. Parker Scott Farkas scene was easily my favorite part of it. The overall film was fun and had all the nostalgia bait you could expect, the imagination scenarios Ralph had were pretty cringe and don’t work at all as an adult except maybe for the first one he had with his book winning the award. But I thought it was solid, far better than I expected. It could have easily been some absolute trash. But we’ll see how I feel about it after seeing it rerun on TV for the next 50 years. Also the prison scene was another standout moment, his son turning into a British sounding punk rocker and his daughter with the messed up eye because of the snowball incident was lol funny. I didn't expect to cry in a Christmas movie, for fuck's sake.  One scene that really stood out and I just didn’t see it coming was when a bunch of older people were trying to sled. That definitely got a big laugh out of me. Seeing adult Scut Farkas in his original outfit is nightmare fuel So good. Bring tissues Something floating around online says the movie ruins Santa for kids, before I watch this with my littles, is it true? The dad was a jerk in the original… so I don’t understand the whole “my dad was my hero” thing. Lol I'm just happy it's finally available so I can stop seeing the godawful ads every commercial break. I haven't seen the movie but I can only assume it's a retread of all the bits from the first movie. It was a 5.

It was solid meh.

It wasn’t horrible. It wasn’t as bad as Christmas Story 2 and not as good as The Summer Story but it missed many elements.

First off the dad dies and everything is just normal. The mom isn’t sad and Ralphie is just like a little down and then that whole plot is dropped besides of course some last moments. Wtf. 

The tropes are replayed with adults taking away the original films groundedness. The adults are idiots. It was cute when they were kids as they weee kids but now it’s like watching a 90s kick in the nuts movie.

The 70s were iconic and it barely touched on that keeping a watered down nostalgia of the era before some small touch points.

But of course it has original actors and replays our favorite memories of the original so we will enjoy it.

The direction was on par with made for TV movies. 

It wasn’t horrible, and I’m glad many liked it.

Edit: I will say it was cute. When in with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. Movie also made me cry, embarrassing to admit haha. I appreciate this movie.. they highlight the midwest magic… especially the bar scenes It was wonderful. It washed the taste of Will Ferrell’s Spirited” out of my mouth, Thank God. I very much disliked the narration by Billingsly. They should have had someone else narrate. 

Something about the the way he enunciated certain words and tryin too hard to sound Barry-White-smooth at other times combined with the cadence of his speech just didn’t work. Y'all can't blame another sequel as a blatant cash grab if you don't give this the same blame. Way overrated so far i liked it but now i can’t think of what other movies or tv shows did the same style ending where someone ends up writing the story of the first one besides >!the arthur cartoon!< I had to turn it off. I thought it was pretty bad. Glad others liked it though. Ralphie seriously married UP.

Really enjoyed the movie; I called in where it was going pretty early but so what. Not really a sequel, not really a prequel.  Or is it both?  Or a movie within a movie? I liked it.   It had big shoes to fill but it was heartwarming and sweet.  Nothing wrong with that in a Christmas movie. I rolled my eyes when I heard they were making a sequel. But then I saw that trailer and got SUPER excited!! It looked and sounded like it was gonna be great!!!  
BUT then I saw the movie.... :\\  
I feel like a better story could've been told between the boys, between Scut, the bar, just them as young men (yea, yea... I understand that everyone was old(er) but still, something better was there - Also, did it feel (as the viewer) that you were sort if ""peeking in"" at the story, whereas in the first one, you felt in it.. The Higbees Santa scene - What the fuck was that?   
I really, really think that a MUCH better story couldn've been told.  
Randy's addition, such a waste!!!    
I'd say, I had the tingles for the first 2-4 minutes of the movie, but the story was shit to me. The death of the dad and the recast of the mom - just cut them from the story! Maybe they're in Florida having a gay ol' time. Or on a cruise... or maybe they died and Ralphie inherits the house, go from there.. I did like seeing the gang again, beyond that... it was a wasted opportunity... especially with so much of the old cast back. ",0,A Christmas Story Christmas
20," Man everytime they change scene, i pray: ""please don't be the kid, please don't be the kid"". For someone who is so deeply anti-murder, Hawkman was very much totally fine with working for Amanda Waller. Is it me or did they not have that scene in the trailers where he was being escorted by jets They just need to play ""What I've Done"" by Linkin Park at the end and it would've been a perfect 2007 movie. “It’s ok I die from electricity” that line had me lmao

Also wish Pierce dr fate stayed alive would’ve loved to see him as the lead in a Dr Fate movie The Rock’s steroids are worth it because the studio didn’t have to pay to digital enhance his muscles. BEAT HIS ASS The crown really wasn't that well hidden at the beginning eh? I'm curious who greenlit the skateboard kid. I find it funny how everyone's immediate takeaway is how bad he is lol I would comment on the movie but I haven't made it through all the slo-mo scenes yet. There were so many funny and/or questionable things in this movie. Or, like ""soo bad it's good"" things. 

- I loved at the end when Dr.Fates illusion wall collapsed outside the throne room, Hawkman just runs up the stairs to get the throne lol. Bro, you have wings, it's faster to fly. 
- The kid on the skateboard somehow taking out a dozen intergang militants inside the apartment complex lol. At one point I think he threw his skateboard at a group of soldiers walking up the stairs, and took out like 4 of them. 
- The kid giving, what felt like, 30 mocking-jay speeches while holding up the Jay-Z rockafella sign. But more than that, him speaking in a ""room"" voice while giving them. I'm not sure how anyone more than 5 feet away could have heard what the fuck he was saying.
- When they put the Rock's face on some scrawny body (the dad from earlier sequences), I laughed uncontrollably. It was so hilarious looking. His face/head was like 3x the size of the body it was on. Critics reviews set my expectations super low.

Went in and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I love that Viola Davis literally phoned in in this movie XD Good thing Kahndaq spends all that money making sure their roads are so smooth so that annoying ass kid could skateboard everywhere I kept thinking Adrianna's medallion would fit in that weird-ass gap of the crown.

It never happened and I'm so pissed for some reason. My biggest takeaway from this movie is that, even more than before, I DESPERATELY want a Dr. Fate movie. Pierce Brosnan carried this movie on his back and I would love to see more of his portrayal of Kent Nelson. Shazam: wizard desperately needs a champion but has set an impossibly high bar for the candidacy as he doesn’t want to repeat the same mistake he made before (black Adam set up) 

Black Adam: wizard isn’t even responsible for black Adam or made any mistake, the son is the champion he originally selected but then he passed on his powers to black Adam 

So who was the wizard’s cautionary tale then? It’s like they didn’t even watch Shazam… Pierce Brosnan was incredible as Dr.Fate, he was the best part of the movie, by far.

That being said, did they explain why Adriana was looking for the crown at the beginning of the movie? Didn't really get why Black Adam would stick around with her and the kid for so long, and that kid got annoying really fast.

Edit: Shoutout to Hellboy for his cameo!! Was it just me or did Atom Smashers mask look like they just resprayed a Deadpool mask? Fun movie. But ngl, that scene with the city folk rising up against evil was corny lol The most superman, superman has ever looked in the dceu imo. The curl, the hair, the colors…. I like the Rock and it was fun watching him beat up intergang an break stuff, but oh my, Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate totally steals every scene he is in. The calmness and suave nature he brought to the character was awesome. Aldis Hodge was also fantastic and the banter between him and the Rock was fun. I guess Pierce Brosnan. didn't want to do multiple movies, but he was perfect as Dr. Fate. I hope he can somehow come back, even for a brief cameo. I hope they do a JSA movie in the future, they really were the best part of the movie Whenever skateboard kid’s not on screen, all the other characters should be asking , “Where’s skate board kid ?” The only thing weaker than the story was the energy from the kid when he gave his rallying speech. The Rock is focusing too much on Black Adam's match with Superman that he keeps forgetting that he's supposed to be Shazam's arch-nemesis. ",0,Black Adam
